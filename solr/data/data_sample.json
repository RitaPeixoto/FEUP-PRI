            "Kiya Mortenson has run into a string of bad luck. She was struck by lightning. Right after she checks out of the clinic with a fresh bill of health, her car decides to stop working on a very dangerous road. Luckily she is saved by a hunky looking man who takes her into town, and pays for her car to be towed. As it turns out, she\u2019s going to need some cash to fix her car. Hunky guy who saved her mentioned his grandmother might hire a helping hand, so she heads off to their RVs. Meanwhile Peter Faa has also entered the town. With Peter\u2019s (kind of) sidekick, a ghost in the shape of a glowing ball, they are determined to track down the killer of a recent string of deaths. Peter is a part of the Watch, a paranormal police order. He has with him DNA evidence that the killer is a member of his family.I\u2019m not new to MacAlister\u2019s work. I greatly enjoyed her Aisling Grey series. So when this one popped up I was very excited to get my hands on it. MacAlister\u2019s novels, or what I\u2019ve read of them, are fast paced romantic comedies with a paranormal twist. Time Thief introduces a new race of people called Travellers. Travellers, well they travel. They live a gypsy kind of life style, moving around from place to place. They can steal time, but have to pay for it or karma will literally bite them. Kiya ends up working for grandmother Faa, caring for her pugs. Because she isn\u2019t a part of the family they set her up in a tent away from the RVs, and before long she runs into Peter Faa who is poking around in the woods. The first meeting between them doesn\u2019t go well, but it isn\u2019t long until Peter is hurt, and runs into Kiya\u2019s tent. It doesn\u2019t take long for Kiya to decide she is going to help him. Together they sort of put two-and-two together until they figure out who the murder is.There is a ton of silliness in these pages, but it might be too silly for my taste. I\u2019m so glad when the heroine isn\u2019t a cop, P.I., detective, or working for some unknown kind of investigative company. Kiya starts out as just a girl down on her luck. She comes off as a little too dense for my taste. On top of that, first impressions mean a lot, and Peter Faa is kind of a jerk. In fact most of the people in the Faa family are jerks. While these two characters make a good match for one another, it bothered me when they didn\u2019t see clues that are right in front of them. Peter is supposed to be a part of the other world Watch, but he\u2019s too involved with watching Kiya to notice when something is buggy is going down.Time Thief\u2019s pacing was well done, but the silliness of it all was a little too much for my taste. The characters seemed a little too dense and random for my taste. Peter and Kiya decide they love each other awfully fast, so fast even Peter\u2019s ghostly friend says something about it. The magic system was very neat and pretty different, and I enjoyed that Kiya wasn\u2019t a stereotypical paranormal heroine.- Beth",
            "Oh dear God, Katie, this book was kind of a mess! I understand what happened though, with her husband and everything... I'm so sad to give her books anything below a 4 star rating, but I just have to this time. There were several plot errors, like our heroine knowing stuff before she was told. (Like who the last murdered person was.) I spotted a few grammar mistakes/typos and this usually doesn't happen with Katie's books. Or the mistakes aren't that obvious at least.I feel obliged to tell everyone that I'm a big fan of Katie's work and that I absolutely love every single one of her books and series that I have read, but I'm kind of reluctant to continue reading this one. The characters's banter was humorous as always, if even a little unrealistic. I thought Kiya was often a bit too unrealistically portrayed, maybe her witty replies were even a little bit over the top to the point that I even felt a little annoyed when she opened her mouth. I felt like there was no chemistry at all between the two main characters and that's just really a pity. I couldn't get into their relationship, but I know that if I could have that Peter would easily have been one of my favourite heroes. Peter's everything you could wish for in a potential love interest. He's kind, caring, not to mention incredibly hot and he has the most beautiful eyes Kiya has ever seen. (He's also kind of the underdog and I love me some underdogs.) But the book just didn't live up to my expectations of Katie MacAlister, this was below average and not even the witty banter and humour in it could save the book. Katie could have added a lot more background to her characters (especially Kiya and Peter) to make their actions more believable. They fell in love instantly and are ready to get married only days after they met each other, which isn't at all how someone in their thirties acts. (That's what I meant earlier with the unrealistic nature of the story.) The world of the Travellers is rather interesting though, so maybe I will consider reading the next book after all. (I'm actually really curious what's going to happen with Gregory!) I don't know yet, I just feel like giving Katie a big hug, because you can just deduce from her manner of writing that she was rather unfocused and probably in a lot of pain when she wrote this book. ",
            "My review can also be found on my blog Collections.3.5 starsTime Thief centered around a supernatural group known as Travellers. Travellers can steal time from others and can actually go back in time with however many seconds, minutes, or days they've taken. Stealing time comes at a price, though, and the victims must be given payment in the form of silver, otherwise the Traveller will suffer the consequences. Taking too much time can also lead to death for either victim or Traveller. Both reasons seem to have kept Travellers in check for centuries.The whole Traveller and time stealing thing was basically simple and easy to understand. Only once you got all the information. And in this book, it was spread throughout the story, which may be why I got a little lost at times. I remember when I was a third into the book there was a conversation between the main characters where one was explaining the time stuff to the other, and while that character was getting it, I was left feeling a bit confused. It didn't affect my enjoyment of the book entirely. But for some reason I still think there was something I missed. I can't quite put my finger on what it was though.Other than my slight confusion at times, the book was pretty fun! What made it that way were the main characters Kiya and Peter. Kiya was bubbly and quirky. She had a tendency to ramble and had a hard time keeping her mouth shut. She wasn't a mean-spirited person at all, but she was also not the type to back down from a fight. When other characters in the book managed to make her angry, I kind of just wanted to pat her head and say, There, there. Peter was more of a serious, uptight person. Meeting Kiya threw him off though, and he gained a sense of humor and seemed more talkative than how I assumed he would be under normal circumstances. I did find some of the romantic things he thought and said to Kiya (and vice versa) cheesy, but I realized it suited their relationship, especially considering their personalities.The other Travellers focused on in this book were the Faa family. They were being investigated by Peter (he's part of the Watch, basically the supernatural police) for murders that have occurred in the area. I think the Faas were always suppose to come off as distant and suspicious and irritating. I can't say I ever liked them, expect one of them who I won't name for possible spoilers. I didn't even like the grandmother. I felt she just stayed in the background while the men in her family did whatever they wanted, and she was too cold and concerned with blood purity. Sad thing was Peter is her grandson. He didn't grow up with them, so it was easy for all of them not to care, but I still felt bad for him. I almost wished things had gone a slightly different route by the end.Time Thief might not have ended well for everyone, however, it was the ending that Kiya and Peter deserved. Overall, the entire book kept me entertained and laughing here and there. It was easy to get sucked into the story. There's a book two planned that will be focusing on a character introduced in this book, and I can't help but to wonder what will happen next.",
            "Time Thief, Traveller #1, by Katie MacAlisterGrade:D\u201cUnhand me, you deranged, if lovely, female!\u201dKiya Mortenson is not having a good day after being struck by lightning, for the second time, having her car breakdown in the middle of Oregon and losing the job she was covering for a friend. After meeting a friendly stranger, Kiya sets out to try to find work taking care of five rowdy pugs for an elderly Traveller woman. The Travellers are not very happy to have Kiya around but she needs the job to fix her car and get back to her life. The more time Kiya spends with the Travellers the more she learns about the supernatural world and her own past.Peter Faa is a Traveller who was never accepted by his family and has spent his life as an outsider. Peter has devoted his life to being a member of The Watch, the supernatural cops, who are now investigating the Faa family for murder. Peter never expected to find an outsider living with his family and Kiya soon snags all of his attention. Peter knows someone in his family has committed murder but it will take Kiya\u2019s help to discover the actual killer.I am so disappointed in this book for so many reasons. I liked the beginning which is told by Kiya in first person but then the book switches to Peter\u2019s point of view in second person. What???I\u2019ve never come across a book told like this and found it very distracting, confusing and annoying. This continues through the rest of the book and almost made me DNF the whole thing.Kiya is one of the most annoying characters that I have ever read. She is flighty, ditzy and comes off as an idiot. She spends most of her time talking about her ego, id and superego or saying very inappropriate things that are supposed to come off as witty. I like my heroines to be strong, smart and sassy and Kiya was none of those things and just comes off as very immature thirty-two year old. Peter for some reason finds her adorable but spends his entire time yelling at her about bewitching him or how she is not smart. The two of them together drove me crazy.As the book goes on and on it becomes even worse and again I have no idea why I kept reading. About halfway through we get one of the most awkward and unsexy sex scenes I\u2019ve ever read. After this Kiya and Peter like to make uncomfortably gross jokes about his \u2018beefy cock\u2019.For example: \u201cSuddenly, he was there, beefy-filled condom and all, thrusting inside me in a manner that left me as the incoherent one.\u201d I never want to read about a beefy-filled condom especially in a romance novel. Besides the bad sex these two are trying to solve a murder that is already solved but takes forever to wrap up.Time Thief was a big fail in my opinion and I will not being reading anymore of this series. ",
            "How to review this book??? I will just have to be as honest as possible without giving away anything. Sorry guys but I just don't DO spoilers...We have a brand new novel from one of the most humorous writers today! Kiya is a unique woman. She starts out the book, with a broken down heap of a car sitting in a doctors office while waiting for her appointment because she has been struck by lightening AGAIN! Yep lightning DOES strike the same spot twice!This book is a laugh a minute! I read this book long into the night, and woke my husband from a sound sleep when my laughing got out of control. Talk about a mess a minute! Peter and Kiya are just too much fun!I have been a fan of Katie MacAlister's books for a while now, and this one is right up there with her other books. We still have the same type creatures as we find in all her other books. And the Watch are alive and well in this book.I HIGHLY recommend this book to anyone who wishes a good laugh and who loves a bit of romance thrown in. And mystery, boy do we have a mystery! And as usual Katie MacAlister uses her humor and all sorts of twists and turns to keep us off our feet for the entire novel.When I turned to the last page in my Kindle I was nearly crying because I wanted MORE!!!! Luckily I know her novella is due out in August with the next book in the series due out shortly thereafter! Thank God for that!Well what are you waiting for? Go grab your own copy!!!!"

            "Plautus (-254 to -184 BC)The comic theatre started, as far as we know with \u2018Aristophanes\u2019 of Athens, a contemporary of Pericles. (5th century BC)Plautus was a Roman author of comic scripts for theatre.He was born in Sarsina in ancient Umbria and died in Rome and lived at the time of the African wars against Cartago and the famous elephant warrior, Hannibal.He took inspiration from Ancient Greek authors, like \u2018Menander\u2019, \u2018Philemonius\u2019, \u2018Diphilius\u2019,but he was able to enrich his work with typical popular humorous actors and Roman backgrounds.He was a successful author in his lifetime.Plautus and Terence are the connecting links to our seventeenth-century authors of theatre.who in turn, inspired authors, like Shakespeare and Moliere.Five of his best plays give an overview of his style: Amphitryon, Asinaria, Aulularia, Menachmi, Miles Gloriosus,Our author used small scenes, situated in locations in Greece or Rome, commonly known to the popular audience.The themes would be simple family conflicts, opposing father and son, or soldiers and courtesans, smart slaves and their dumb owners, old lovers, etc.For the modern reader, Plautus\u2019 work is a complementary subject for additional knowledge in history and culture.",
            "Only read The Braggart Soldier. Boring compared to Lysistrata. ",
            "Surprising seemingly contemporary pranks considering the playwright\u2019s from the 3rd century BC!!! Titus Maccius Plautus, 254-184 BC. From the intro: Pg XV, On Casina \u2013 \u201cPerhaps the strongest irony is the dramaturgical in-joke of the title itself. We know from internal evidence that this is one of the plays which has been renamed by Plautus. Thus he has deliberately called it after a person who does not appear, the ultimate thumb in the nose to Greek New Comedy.\u201d In the first play - The Braggart Soldier - a vainglorious soldier makes easy prey for a shrewd servant who steals from his master by way of a dowry. The second play - The Brothers Menaechmus - is a comedy of revolving doors as long lost twins are mistaken for one another over and over. The third play - The Haunted House - isn\u2019t quite as effective as the other two, as, rather than offering variations on a central conceit, the plot is rather convoluted. My favourite is the 4th and final play in this volume, even though the character of the miser is inconsistent, and not all of the play has survived for the telling. From The Pot of Gold (I thought comedy would date more than this after more than a couple of millennia!!!), the slaves discuss Euclio the miserAnthrax: What do you mean?Strobilus: I mean he\u2019s mean! That man\u2019s about as liquid as a pumice stone!Anthrax: You don\u2019t say.Congri: (butting in) Yes I do say.Strobilus: Just see for yourself. He calls on gods and men to witness that he\u2019s bankrupt, totally wiped out if but a smoky wisp blows from his twiggy fire. And at night he ties a bag around his mouth.Anthrax: Why?Strobilus: So he won\u2019t lose any breath while he\u2019s asleep.Anthrax: Why doesn\u2019t he plug up his lower parts as well? Then he won\u2019t even lose a fart when he\u2019s asleep.Strobilus: Believe me, you should trust what I\u2019m saying.Anthrax: But honestly I do believe you.Strobilus: And there\u2019s more. He cries to heaven if we throw out water from a person\u2019s bath.Anthrax: (facetiously) In other words, he won\u2019t give us a silver talent to buy our freedom. Do you think there\u2019s not much chance? Strobilus: The fellow wouldn\u2019t even let you have his hunger if you asked. The other day when he had his nails cut by the barber he scooped up all the bits and took them home with him. Anthrax: By Pollux, what a miserable mingy miser!Strobilus: Indeed. Could anyone be more miserable and miserly?One day a kite pecked off a little grain of porridge. The fellow stormed down to the courthouse, all in tears, and uncontrollably he wailed and railed to have an order issued that the bird be jailed!I won\u2019t give this a star rating, as I\u2019ve no barometer for hits of the 3rd century BC",
            "Four fairly light, entertaining plays. They aren't high literature. Slapstick plots to suit a rough Roman audience. Admittedly puns don't translate well, and Plautus was a punner, but the simple plots with mistaken identities of long lost twins, a boastful soldier getting his comeuppance, a trickster slave rehabilitating the wastrel son of a long-lost father and a miser parting with his pot of gold to enable the nuptials of his daughter to the man who ravished her (apparently a favourite Greek trope) are diverting, if not very convincing.If only the Romans had stuck to the theatre rather than the arena....",

            "Set in late 1970s Iran, this novel is narrated by Behruz Pirzad who, after studying in the U.S., has returned to Iran upon hearing that his twin brother Ruzbeh is suffering with post-traumatic stress as a result of fighting in the Iran-Iraq war. Behruz finds his home country greatly changed. Because of the repressive religious authoritarian rule of the ayatollahs, Behruz\u2019s affair with a married woman has disastrous consequences and he ends up hiding out at Narenjastan, his family\u2019s lemon grove. In flashbacks he describes his happy childhood spent at the grove, outlines some of his experiences in the United States, and refers to what happened upon his return to post-revolutionary Iran.  I had difficulty getting emotionally involved with the novel and its characters. At the beginning we learn that Behruz attempted suicide by ingesting pesticide and, though he survives, he remains somewhat disjointed from reality. Just as he feels dislocated from a place he no longer recognizes, the reader remains detached from him. The fact that most of the novel is narrated via flashbacks gives the impression of events occurring at a distance which further distances the reader from the impact of those events. The book is fairly short and could use some further development. There are unanswered questions: Is Musa\u2019s distrust of Kemal warranted? How can Shireen\u2019s behaviour be explained if her love for her husband is as deep as she claims and if she is aware of the consequences of an illicit affair? Some of the plotting is weak. For example, Behruz\u2019s visit to the home of Javid and Farideh seems very coincidental especially since they were never mentioned previously and then serve such a pivotal role. The novel does give a glimpse of life for ordinary Iranians during a time of upheaval. Certainly the peaceful childhood Behruz remembers no longer exists. The lemon grove serves as a symbol of the collapsing society. At one time the grove was lush and full of sweet lemons, now a disease has attacked the trees which bear little fruit, and the desert is gradually encroaching on the grove. There is a suggestion that the land can be brought back to life but it will require a great deal of tending by both the young and the old, represented by Kemal and Musa in whose care Behruz leaves the grove.The author makes clear that he believes hope for Iran\u2019s future lies in not letting \u201cthe scars of the past . . . dim hope and optimism toward the future.\u201d He describes Iran as \u201can old nation not able to break with its past, a past that is a heavy load not just dragged behind but also controlling the future. . . . It\u2019s as if the train of time had left us many stations back while we were busy with our past and our God.\u201d I appreciated the perspective offered by this book: an inside look into Iran at a time of turmoil. I just wish it had been provided more than just a glimpse and had been more emotionally engaging.Please check out my reader's blog (http://schatjesshelves.blogspot.ca/) and follow me on Twitter (@DCYakabuski).",

He has run away from danger in the city and is hiding. He feels he has left Shireen to face punishment alone and in despair drinks poison. A family friend finds him and helps him purge the poison. While recovering, this friend Musa, shares information about Behruz's missing twin brother, Ruzbeh as well as telling him stories about himself.It was hard to really get involved with the story. Behruz doesn't talk much at first so the interactions feel stilted. There is also a lot of exposition through Behruz reminiscing of his childhood and young adulthood. I liked the characters just never really felt connected to them.",
            "The most compelling aspect of this book for me was the sense of loss and longing. One could concentrate on the loss of the loved one but in this book the loss of a country, the loss of a culture, the loss of family and the loss of the past resonate even stronger in me. There is a pervading sense of sadness and nostalgia that grabs me at a very personal level being a self-exiled person living in a different country and a different culture. In the case of the protagonist though, this personal loss becomes a loss of national proportions when he returns to his country of origin now in the hands of fanatical religious leaders that have transformed Iran from a prosperous, modern nation with a rich historical past into a nation torn inside, divided, isolated,ostracized by the West and deeply mistrusted. Not all Iranians are bent on the destruction of the infidels abroad, most of them just want to live in peace,get an education,raise a family and contribute to society. This novel can be read at many levels but for those Americans who judge Iran based on headline news and soundbites of our biased media, it would be quite instructive to understand how many Iranians see the current situation in Iran. This book read as a window into the political and religious situation in Iran could do much to the cause of peace and understanding between nations. "

While there has been an outpouring of academic essays, anthologies and other full-length texts which study this transition, most have focused on the Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC).What is Slavery to Me? is the first full-length study of slave memory in the South African context, and examines the relevance and effects of slave memory for contemporary negotiations of South African gendered and racialized identities. It draws from feminist, postcolonial and memory studies and is therefore interdisciplinary in approach. It reads memory as one way of processing this past, and interprets a variety of cultural, literary and filmic texts to ascertain the particular experiences in relation to slave pasts being fashioned, processed and disseminated.Much of the material surveyed across disciplines attributes to memory, or \u201cpopular history making,\u201d a dialogue between past and present whilst ascribing sense to both the eras and their relationship. In this sense then, memory is active, entailing a personal relationship with the past which acts as mediator of reality on a day to day basis. The projects studies various negotiations of raced and gendered identities in creative and other public spaces in contemporary South Africa, by being particularly attentive to the encoding of consciousness about the country\u2019s slave past.This book extends memory studies in South Africa, provokes new lines of inquiry, and develops new frameworks through which to think about slavery and memory in South Africa.",

            "The Machiavellians: Defenders of Freedom  was originally published as  The Modern Machiavellians.  The renaming seems to make it more in line with American conservative rhetoric around liberty--a concern Burnham would not have had in the early 1940s. James Burnham was always the post-Trotskyist Marxist turned liberal reactionary par excellence, ambivalently responsible for National Review and part of the thinkers in selected by George Kennan for the OSS. Fascinatingly, here because he turns his Marxist love of materialist political analysis away from Marxism and into the theories of five key thinkers: Niccol\u00f2 Machiavelli, Gaetano Mosca, Georges Sorel, Robert Michels, and Vilfredo Pareto. While several will attribute this to a conservative critique of the bad faith of Utopian politics but miss that all the thinkers with the exception of Machevilli are indirectly linked with fascism in some key way and for a book written in 1943, this is not an insignificant argument. Furthermore, Mosca was further developed by Michels and Pareto, about the function of elites. All of them were distant thinkers informed by either Marxism or anarchism but who give up on fighting the power elite and instead try to make it socially productive. So some people will read this as a statement of conservative political philosophy but it is not from the US political tradition and, in some ways, comes from the hangover that Burnham seems to have had after writing the Managerial Revolution  and break away from Trotskyism.The Marxist Paul Mattick commented that Burnham had begun to purge himself of the remnants of that had remained in the Managerial Revolution  (which famously enraged George Orwell enough he wrote two reviews of it and whose theories who incorporates into Bernstein, the Trotsky surrogate, in 1984). I am not so sure Burnham actually does here--the hints of Marxist are in Burnham's exposition and interpretation of Dante's utopian Imperial politics in De Monarchia  as theology and bad faith self-apologia. It does work well to establish what Machiavellians are not. Dante's political writings are a theological facade for betraying his republic, and that is clear, frankly. The ethical and theological imperatives are figleaves, and we should be made more sterner and more scientific stuff.  Burnhams' readings of Machiavelli are odd in that he takes Machiavelli entirely at his word at face value. Machiavelli's layering of irony is not treated with any seriousness. While parts of Burnham's reading of Machiavelli as an openly transparent force are similar to Marxist thinkers like Gramsci, he seems to not be a very sophisticated reader of the Machiavelli, presenting the Discourses on Livy as nearly entirely in line with  the Prince . Machiavelli's cynicism often leads to terrible advice that contradicts his other writings, and Machiavelli did not widely promote the work. Burnham's reading of Machiavelli was an Italian unificationist is frankly very much in contradictions with his other writings and given the citations Burnham is giving, he has to know this. Furthermore, Machiavelli writes in a different spirit from Mosca, Michels, and Pareto, who are, by Burnham's accounts, more scientific. Sorels is the odd one out here, and the only real link seems to be that Sorel's revisions to the mythic event in syndicalist Marxist are an inspiration to the unspoken f-word in the book: fascism. There are hidden polemics against Marxism in the books reading of Mosca: Mosca's theories of history are multi-casual and not monistic. However, in doing so, according to Burnham, Mosca comes up with a theory of the masses and the ruling class. While elites are given and some of these are outcomes consistent in what would be worked out by games theory and public theory, the idea that is necessarily only two classes that matter--the rulers and ruled--is, in many ways, more monistic than Marxist analysis. However, Burnham's polemical inconsistencies aside, he does a pretty good job of summarizing Mosca's theories and some of the problematic implications of them for modern representative democratic republics. Like I mentioned earlier, Sorel's revision to Marxist syndicalism lead to Sorel's love of both Lenin and Giovanni Gentile, two topics that Burnham, the ex-Marxist, cannot really directly deal with, nor can he deal with Sorel's endorsement of anti-semitic writings to spread socialism. Sorel's thesis that the general strike was an animating myth is illuminating, and, sadly, for many Marxists, the concept of revolution has played a similar motivational and eschatological role as have historical figures such as Lenin, Stalin, and Mao. Now Sorel's theories were about violence and motivation but in general, were against the materialist views of Marxist and the need to make politics a science. His inclusion seems odd until you look at what the other thinkers share with him. Then we have Burnham's reading on Robert Michels, and the inclusion of makes more sense, as Michels was part of the syndicalist drift towards fascism and then became an explicit theorist of fascism as well as being highly influenced by Mosca. Burnham is very quiet about this context and does not contextualize Michels' work: if it is scientific, then why, again does Burnham need to? I could not be that all of the Italian thinkers but one proto-fascist or fascist ties and, like his thesis in the Managerial Revolution, fascists were more likely to control other capitalist elites who have countered society through management? His exposition of Michels iron law of oligarchy is coherent enough and fair, but that lack of context as well as his selection of scientific political thinkers becomes more and more suspicious. Then we have the discussion of Pareto, which is part of the critique against Marxism. According to Burnham. Pareto only seeks to describe and correlate social facts--while this does not strike a non-Marxist as a particular critique of Marxism, remember that Marxists have claimed that Marxism would be a scientific way to understand and change society, not merely correlate it. Burnham's description of Pareto residues is interesting as his reading of the five factors Pareto thinks are important for society: 1) physical environment, 2) residues (or human universal tendencies), 3) economic factors, 4) derivations and 5) the circulation of elites. Admittedly, 1 and 3 are generally talked about in Marxist circles as material conditions, and 2 are proto-anthropological human tendencies, 4) seems like some that were further developed out in later social science, but it is 5) that concerns Burnham the most. Admittedly, Burnham's readings of Pareto's and the way elite power blocks form in parliamentary societies are haunting. Yet this scientific turn is not, truly speaking, science. Furthermore, despite this interest in science, all the modern Italian and French thinkers that Burnham invokes are directly linked to fascism. Yes, there are many truisms that Burnham finds: elites drift and are self-interested. Naivete in politics can have disastrous results, but these truisms are not unique to any of these thinkers. Furthermore, if Marxism fails as a science, what Burnham does doubly fails. Almost all his predictions are wrong and seem a reflection of the conditions of Italy and Germany that were beginning to collapse at the time. Military Bonapartism, a hangover from Burnham's Trotskyist days with some real applications, does not become the dominant form of US life despite the existence of a political power elite. Indeed, if anything, after Eisenhower, the trend is away from both the military and civilian competence to people with public relations and legal backgrounds. Furthermore, Burnham predicts that elites in Europe in post-colonial scramble would be back at war in a short period of time--reflecting the conditions of world war 1 and world war 2 but ignoring the nuclear change of the game and the increasing difficulty of the cold war. IN almost all predictions, Burnham takes the conditions of the early forties, conditions that informed the early fascist thinkers, and uses them to predict in the future incorrectly. While applying scientific methodologies and mathematics to politics has greatly helped us, if you cannot see ANY of several major changes coming in the near future, you have failed to produce a useful political analytic rubric that abides by those methodologies. Predictions matter. The fact that Burnham does not really deal with the fascist current in all the modern political thinkers he chooses would not age well for defenders of freedom if people knew who these figures actually were and context for Burnham's selection and his argument with Marxism. Burnham had not yet become the mentor to William Buckley and grand old man at the The National Review. Despite being wrong on many of these predictions, George Kennan did hand select him for the OSS presumably for his scientific bent, but if this writing is a sample of his early post-Marxist thinking, he was given a lot of slack for being wrong in ways that are different from his analysis in The Managerial Revolution  which do explain things going on Russia, the US, and Europe fairly well but again picks a losing side in the political forces trying to control management."

            "One of the greatest books on political theory one can have the pleasure of reading, elucidating the Machiavellian realist or amoral analysis of politics. Both an analysis of it's chief figures, their theories and a contrast of the politics as wish as represented by Dante. This should be in the curriculum of all political theory/philosophy/science classes, it's brevity and clarity are to be envied.",
            "The Machiavellians is one of those rare books in which the ideas expressed are absolutely compelling and the prose is eloquent, too, so that it feels great to read it.Burnham starts by talking about a manifesto of the Democratic Party and Dante's (yes, the same Dante who produced The Inferno) political writing. Both profess to be for lofty ideas but that's just the formal meaning of their political will. There's always a real meaning behind these claims and what distinguishes the Machiavellians is that they want to find the real motives of political actors and analyze the realm of politics just as one would any other science: by looking at facts.Machiavelli is the bogeyman of many but his only flaw is that he was the first political scientist: he made statements about how political man works by observation and not by appealing to moral justice or anything of the kind that rulers \u2013and the intellectuals supporting them\u2013 use to justify their privileged status in society.In subsequent chapters we learn about great Machiavellian thinkers, like Gaetano Mosca who came up with the concept of the xa0political formula \u2013 the myth that justifies the rule of the current ruling class (the subsequent chapters are about Robert Michels and Vilfredo Pareto).The book then goes into further details about what makes a society (which is, remember, at any moment sharply divided between rulers are ruled) stable and what provides the ruled with the highest possible degree of freedom.As I said, the book is the kind where one would highlight every second sentence and guard it as a gem that illuminates people's minds about the nature of power so it's hard to pick one quote to conclude my review but here goes:\u201cNo societies are governed by the people, by a majority, all societies, including societies called democratic, are ruled by a minority. But the ruling minority always seeks to justify and legitimize its rule in part through a formula, without which the social structure would disintegrate.\u201dTo see all of my reviews from the book, see https://www.goodreads.com/notes/43794....",
            "This book is an odd, but powerful refutation of the notion of democracy and that society can avoid being ruled by a small number of elites.Growing up, I somehow inhaled the American notion that, until the founding of America, most nations were largely limited in what they could do, and that with the innovation of voting, the world had turned a corner and most individuals were better off. I still am profoundly grateful for American notions of liberty and freedom, and this book made me appreciate those liberties even more. However, for a long time now, I have not seen democracy as the source of those freedoms, individual or otherwise, and Burnham has the uncanny ability to point out how democracy actually aggravates individual liberty rather than increasing it.There's a lot of places to go here, but I want to get a few things out of the way. James Burnham had an odd checkered past as a Trotsykyite and a communist before starting to write for the National Review and becoming a conservative author, with Suicide of the West being his best well-known work. In this book you definitely feel a sense of his middle-aged atheism in how he talks about non-logical (read religious) behavior. (He returned to religion in old age.) You also get a sense of his being a logical positivist, perhaps in how he talks about politics as a science.At the same time, most of Burnham's arguments make sense with what I see of how people act. He is perhaps dismissive of Aristotle and other philosophers, but then again, Taleb points out that philosophers have not been the best political thinkers. At any rate, Burnham makes the rather obvious point that no society can vote on all political decisions, and even if most people wanted to do so, in order to achieve their goals, they would have to join coalitions led by representatives. This means that, without exception, most societies will be governed by a minority, by an elite class. Ironically, rather than restraining power, the idea of democracy tends to absolutize power. After all, if we all believe that our elites are simply us, without any sense of representation and the responsibility that brings with it, it is far easier for some dictator to come along and claim that, because he simply is the will of the people, he can use absolute power. Burnham expresses this by saying that democracy leads to Bonapartism.This is a powerful argument, and it's an invaluable part of Burnham. However, the best part of the book is the last part, where he talks about how a good elite functions, and how freedom can actually exist in a society. He says that societies consist of a innovative, enterprising, even conniving element, and of a conservative, steady, force-wielding element. He says society must have both elements in the elite, or society will stagnate through conservatism or fail to exert order through too much liberalism. He also insists that the elite should be both aristocratic in some ways (policing its ranks), but also open to up-and-comers from below (meritocratic.) He says that some elites lose their will to rule and retreat into art, style, and decadence, lest it lose power through some sort of social revolution. One of the most fascinating points that Burnham makes is that societies are less violent if they admit the necessity of violence. Violence is inevitable in this world, until Judgment Day, and Burnham knows this and at several points recognizes the importance of the elite having the will to rule. As Christians in an egalitarian world, we often act like Aragorn in Jackson's Lord of the Rings movies, or like Harry Potter or any number of modern protagonists who never feel competent to judge or make tough decisions. Burnham adds to the many voices in my head saying that authority is how God made the world and we do better to acknowledge it with all its problems than to kill it through demands for perfection.In the last few explosive pages he argues that we are entering a managerial age, which fits with his , the idea that the capitalists are being overwhelmed by the bureaucrats, because in his day the entrepreneurs had lost the will to rule. He insists that for society to be free in any sense that is meaningful, there must be competing interests, with no one power preventing opposition. Burnham points out that, despite all the promise of democracy, the Nazi and Soviet regimes were not as free as the American regime. Burnham ends on a fascinating point: Only power restrains power. That restraining power is expressed in the existence and activity of oppositions. Oddly and fortunately, it is observable that the restraining influence of an opposition much exceeds its apparent strength. As anyone with experience in any organization knows, even a small opposition, provided it really exists and is active, can block to a remarkable degree the excesses of the leadership. (223) Burnham, of course, knows that this cannot be a mere grassroots movement. It has to be the elite that is involved in this social change, but Burnham does think that social pressure from the masses can infiltrate inner-elite fights: Confronted with this multiple attack from elites and masses, the governing elite, in order to try to keep control, is in turn compelled to grant certain concessions and to correct at least some of the more glaring abuses. The net indirect result of the struggle, which from one point of view is only a fight between two sets of leaders, can thus be benefits for large sections of the masses. The masses, blocked by the iron law of oligarchy from directly and deliberately ruling themselves, are able to limit and control, indirectly, the power of their rulers. (emphasis added). There is a lot in this last bit in the book. I am reminded of the title of Taleb's book Intransigent Minorities. This seems to be a reasonable model of social order that avoids the extremes of both totalitarianism and anarchy, and avoids the foolish idea that any individual or party can run the state through sufficient lobbying while also avoiding the idea that individuals can utterly passive in the face of government. It also gets at the best of checks and balances and Republican government without exaggerating the influence of the Constitution along, say, American Vision lines. At any rate, this is a good book that people into conservative political theology should read.",
            "Nominally about \u201cfive Italian philosophers,\u201d but that summary is a little misleading. More accurately, this book is Burnham\u2019s framework for understanding power in a political context. \u201cNo theory, no promises, no morality, no amount of good will, no religion will restrain power\u201d he writes. \u201cOnly power restrains power.\u201d ",

            "Vol. 6 of 10This volume includes an interesting introduction at the end of the book by Vaughan explaining the process of what goes into making a graphic novel. I was a little surprised to find out that most people find graphic novels disjointed because of all the hands that go into the pot in order to expedite issues for monthly production. If anything, all the series/graphic novels I have read seem to NEED that collaboration between writer and artist to translate their vision onto paper and I feel have been successful at it. It\u2019s a marriage of the two. I also enjoyed seeing how they have people play out the character scenes and pose as the panel is to going to be drawn. I hadn\u2019t ever really thought about how these scenes get on paper, but I thought it was a neat process. Recap of this volume to remind myself. ****Possible spoilers ahead****:--We see a second possible archnemesis? This one steps out of the river swathed in an electric field, causing a blackout throughout the whole city. He is looking for Mitch to pass on information on how they got their powers, so it is unknown whether he\u2019s a good or bad guy. His powers however are able to neutralize Mitch\u2019s powers, so it is yet to be seen what will come of this story.--The issue of immigration is mentioned but never concluded. Can I just say that I\u2019m a little tired of everytime immigration is brought up it is immediately blamed on Mexicans. They are not the only people who are immigrants. People from all over Europe, Asia, Africa, South America, to name a few, immigrate to the U.S. It is not just Mexico. That joke gets a little old and I found it insulting how Mexico is the first place people point a finger to.--We see a bit more of a glimpse into what happened on 9/11. I did question though how Mitch knew the second tower would get hit. He was already using his powers to call on some fighter jets to assist him in stopping the second plane from hitting the second tower, but these are just glimpses we see into the past without much explanation. This is already the sixth volume so I\u2019m wondering when Vaughan is going to start tying up ends.Overall, a good issue.",

I wouldn\u2019t even call this a comic.

The parallel NYC was amazing and Mitchell Hundred is one of the most interesting characters I\u2019ve seen.Vol 6 moved a little slower. It had the story of a power outage but this volume also helped to build up the backstory. I don\u2019t want to give anything away so I\u2019ll just say that I highly recommend Ex MachinaFYI: I\u2019ll leave a review for all ten volumes but only change the last paragraph because the first three paragraphs were so powerful that they are relevant to all ten volumes..

It doesn\u2019t get as much play as some of the policy-oriented issues, but I still appreciate it.The \u2018superhero\u2019 side of Power Down deals with Hundred losing his abilities to communicate with machines during the blackout, and dealing with a traveler from an alternate version of Earth, where the Cold War still rages and 9/11 never happened. (Incidentally, the discussion Hundred has about how best to memorialize 9/11 is probably the best rumination in the book). Once again, we get a tantalizing glimpse of the nature of Hundred\u2019s powers, only for it to be snatched away too soon.Of particular note is the backmatter to the comic, which contains a ton of interesting behind-the-scene stuff, including information on Vaughan\u2019s collaborative process and the artistic workflow. Definitely worth a read.",
            "More super heroes mixed with politics. During a city-wide blackout, Hundred faces a dimension traveler who has a warning about Hundred's new powers. I find the volumes that explore Hundred's powers, and where they came from, to be more interesting."

            "What a disappointment! I\u2019ve been searching for this story for years and there was always something to get in my way. So I wanted it more and more, having already some mental image of how it may look. Based on the summary and the positive reviews I believed it will be a deeply psychological story with a mystery subplot. Unfortunately, it has nothing to do with psychological novels. I have no idea \u2013 maybe in Swedish it\u2019s a wonderful read. The author himself translated it into English and maybe he simply wasn\u2019t able to do it well. Let\u2019s be done with saying it \u2013 the language is so awful I had hard time finishing this little nightmare. Was it a school essay? Because especially the dialogues sounded like ones that my students used to create. It\u2019s not simplicity, nothing that make you think such style was chosen on purpose. The characters are extremely flimsy, it\u2019s difficult to talk about their personalities in any way. The supposed detective story \u201cwith loose ends, clues and cliff hangers\u201d is rather embarrassing and the epic romance can\u2019t play out if the characters have close to no depth. It all happens so fast that you can\u2019t get attached to anyone, it makes little sense in so many places, and even my favourite usage of a foreign language here felt awkward. The book left me angry because it wasted such a promising premise. It could have been great\u2026 But it\u2019s not, it\u2019s absolutely not. Do yourself a favour and avoid it.(I might be a bit too firm maybe, I had such expectations\u2026)",

            "Just based on the title I did not think I was going to like this book very much, but I actually really enjoyed it and it's message. Pirates and Princesses is a fiction book about Ivy and Fletch. They have been friends their whole lives, in fact their mother's were pregnant at the same time and they were born a day apart. They went through all the stages together from learning to sit up to running. They did everything together. It wasn't until kindergarten that they had to choose to play with the boys or the girls. They enjoyed being Pirate and Princess but they valued their friendship more and they preferred playing together. They taught the kids other games that they could play like leaping lizards and twisty cakes. These games were not exclusive to one gender or the other and anyone could play on any team.. they were inclusive and the only thing that mattered was that everyone was having fun. This book is interesting for elementary age kids and is very relatable . I love that the characters are believable and the illustrations do a good job of corresponding with the text and depicting the characters and settings accurately. We can learn a lot about friendships and being open minded from reading this book. This story shows us that kids are kids and that boys and girls should play together. It also shows that kids should be able to choose what team they want to play on or what games they want to play. The only thing that I did not like about this books was that the characters did not represent a variety of cultural groups.",
            "Liked the overall message, but didn't like stereotypes",
            "It's inevitable with television and retail marketing that kids are going to associate certain play items with being a boy and others with being a girl. Ever notice sections of Toys R Us that are entirely pink? While it's impossible to avoid such displays, I try to be as gender neutral as possible when it comes to the toys my children (a girl and a boy) play with, the clothes they wear, the colors they like, etc.That's basically the gist of Pirates and Princesses. Ivy and Fletch have known each other since birth. Their moms are best friends, and soon they are too. All is well until they get to kindergarten and first experience...recess!The girls want Ivy to play princesses, and the boys want Fletch to play Pirates. I won't say much more other than the book is sweet, hysterically funny in it's narration, and has a great message about being who you want to be regardless of gender stereotypes. And so, when I was done reading the story to my daughter, I tucked her in tight, all snuggled in her football pjs that she picked out when she was four (and she's six now and still wears them). And I smiled to myself as I thought of my almost three-year-old asleep on his Disney princess pillow case. Love whatever you want.",
            "This book makes it okay for boys and girls to be friends and play the same games, without being boyfriend and girlfriend. It would be great to use if there is gender bullying on the playground because it encourages games that aren't gender based, like princess castle or pirate ship. Cooties definitely are not a problem in this book, and that is why I like it. You could read this book just with words OR pictures only! It is not a book I will exactly remember, but it does have a good message, like most children's books do. ",
            "My kids really liked this...esp. my 6 yo daughter who loves both pirates and princesses. Ivy and Fletch have been friends forever, but once they go to school they begin to make other friends and for a time will only play with children of the same gender...the boys play pirates and the girls play princesses. But Ivy and Fletch shake things up on the playground and recess is about to become a lot more fun!",
            "Pirates and Princesses is about a little boy Fletch and a little girl Ivy who have been the best of friends since birth. Then comes kindergarten where the boys play with only boys and the girls play with only girls. The Pirate team and the Princess Team. A really cute story about how one boy and girl teach all of the others how to play with each other on the playground. A wonderful teaching tool for peer pressure, friendship and play."

The practical advice contained in his guidebook for the faithful was originally a series of letters written for the Nuns of the Visitation of Nancy, meant to help them navigate the confusing and difficult work of spiritual enlightenment, and comes together here in two distinct parts, one for the theoretical foundations of abandoning oneself to the present moment and one with practical advice on how to live such a life.

            "ENGLISH: I have read this book in an English translation from the original French. The work proper is one fourth of the size of the book, which was completed by many letters, addressed mainly to nuns, giving them counsel. At a point, those letters become a little repetitive.I think this work is part of a current, typical of its time (the 18th century), which tended to despise reason, perhaps as a reaction against the Enlightenment. For example, in section IV of chapter 2, it says this: To behold divine mysteries it is necessary to shut the eyes to what is external, and to cease to reason. I think this is too strong. There have been important saints (such as St. Albertus Magnus or St. Thomas Aquinas) whose vocation was clearly addressed to the use of reason, also for the study of divine mysteries.ESPA\u00d1OL: Le\u00ed este libro en traducci\u00f3n inglesa del franc\u00e9s original.

            "There are some books which are almost too good to be able to describe. (Reading my friend Caterina\u2019s excellent recent review of this book got me to read my own and made me aware of the need to update it!) She also introduced me to another, more complete edition of this book which I want to check out when I next have time to return to this book. As a novice Secular Carmelite, I hope we will be reading this in the years ahead.One of the many beautiful things about this book is its simplicity. Another is its brevity. I have read both versions, Sacrament of the Present Moment, being the newer translation of Abandonment of Divine Providence. I prefer the older, but each has its place. Both titular phrases are Fr. Caussade\u2019s own words for the profound yet childlike concept he is trying to teach us. Remain in the here-and-now, that is where the incarnate Christ dwells. Abandonment wasn't published until a hundred and ten years after the author\u2019s death. Father Caussade never knew he wrote this book, what we read today was originally a collection of letters written when he was the spiritual director to the Visitation nuns of Nancy in France\u2014as well as notes from talks he gave them.Born in 1675 in the south of France, there is almost nothing known about Caussade\u2014no picture survives, no physical description, and very few facts. But we do know he was born during an era when the Catholic faith was rich and vibrant, he grew up in the shadow of such giants as St. John of the Cross, St. Teresa of Avila, St. Francis de Sales and St. Jane de Chantal. In fact, although he was a Jesuit, his writings reflect more Carmelite and Salesian spirituality, than they do Ignatian influence.\u2018Short books often have great power.\u2019 This one is a perfect example. There is one central theme and it is\u2014give or \u201cabandon\u201d yourself to God/Divine Providence \u2013 and no harm can come to you. \u201cBe Not Afraid,\u201d as Jesus said, and Pope John Paul II reiterated in his late twentieth century pontificate. The book is a series of meditations, meant to be consumed in small bite-sized pieces and then savored or contemplated. That is why it is perfect both as an audiobook and a devotional. It constantly circles back to the gentle reminder we have but one (three-fold) duty\u2014to abandon ourselves to His Will, trust Him in everything and live in the Present Moment. Such a sweetly elemental principle! We humans want to complicate everything, He wants to simplify things. We want to hold on to our problems, He wants to relieve us of them. Recently, I have been filling my poor head with facts from confusing technical reading which doesn't clarify or solve anything. Fortunately, at the same time, I have also been listening to my Ignatian Press tapes, while driving in the car, of Mark Taheny as he reads Abandonment. Talk about peace and transport--peace in transport. I look forward to my time alone absorbing these Christ-like words which reassure me that all I need to do is surrender to Him and love. Do my Christian duty always and forget about what others think about me. If I am misunderstood, so much the better\u2014so was He. And when I slip up and fall into sin\u2014which I will do (as we all do)\u2014I throw myself on His Loving Mercy.Let go of the past. Forget about the future. Be in the present. He is taking care of everything else. All things work together for our good if we let Him work in our lives. What does not make sense now, does not matter. If He wills it, it is\u2014that is enough. As with most spiritual books different parts are helpful with each read. On this particular listening I was struck by the sixth and seventh sections of Chapter Six: (6) An abandoned soul is not afraid of its enemies, but finds them useful allies. \u2018I am more afraid of what I and my friends do than anything done by my enemies. There is nothing more prudent than to offer no resistance to one's enemies and face them with simple abandonment. This is to run before the wind and stay at peace. Simplicity is always victorious when faced with worldly wisdom and easily avoids all its tricks without understanding them or even being conscious of them. God makes the soul take such suitable measures that they completely confound those who seek to trap it. It benefits by all their efforts, and what is meant to degrade it only increases its virtue.\u2019 (7) An abandoned soul never need try to justify itself by word or deed. God does that. \u2018The huge, unyielding rock that shelters the soul from all storms is the divine will, which is always there, though hidden beneath the veil of trials and the most commonplace actions. Deep within those shadows is the hand of God to support and carry us to complete self-abandonment. And when the soul has arrived at this sublime state it need fear nothing which is said against it, for there is no longer anything for it to do in self-defense.\u2019   These are not the complete sections, but I have quoted enough to convey the gist of each. The reminder to me was that the reading I had been doing\u2014at someone else's request--was looking for a worldly solution to problems. Listening to Fr. Caussade I remembered that at core, all problems are essentially spiritual because we are spirit. One of my favorite sayings is, \u201cWe are spiritual beings having a human experience.\u201d Yes, I am a sinner, we all are. We sin every day by our thoughts, words and actions, but God forgives us for all our sins, so long as we truly repent. The only sin He can't forgive is the one for which we are not truly sorry. I am eternally grateful for this wonderful little book--which I have already read many times--and to which I hope to return many more times. God bless you Father Caussade! review written 26 September 2007, updated 2 April 2017",
            "Finished listening to this again. As my husband was walking through the room and caught snatches of the CD playing he commented, \u201cSounds like he\u2019s talking about me.\u201d Abandonment to Divine Providence has universal appeal, although different parts speak more at different times in our lives.I\u2019m especially challenged now\u2014as always\u2014to let go of my own ideas and plans, to remain in the present moment and to trustfully surrender all to His adorable Will, His loving Providence. I will be due to read this again in 18 months or so. Maybe less. A treasure!Nov 25, 2014: Between this and The Sacrament of the Present Moment, which is modern version of the same book, I prefer this. However, I'm going to re-read both and do a comparison. (Update: Still want to do this sometime, but didn't get to it during this read.)",
            "To avoid any anxieties which may be caused by either regret of the past or fear of the future, here in a few words is the rule to follow: the past must be left to God's measureless mercy, the future to his loving providence, and the present must be given wholly to his love through our fidelity to his grace. Amen.I love this book. Read very slowly in tiny but intense \u201cdoses\u201d suitable for morning meditation, like a restorative juice for the soul, it works quietly, opening the way to deep inner peace, humility, release from attachments, and ultimately the quiet confidence, inner strength, and loving attitude of service that come from God. For the most part it is a deeply gentle, non-violent book of spiritual guidance for those who long to become closer to God, but find themselves thwarted by anxiety, inner turbulence, and despair of the world and of themselves, their own wills, plans, and designs -- especially for those who have already spent some years on a spiritual path integrating focused contemplative prayer and action. If taken to heart, a transformative book. It was recommended to my husband his spiritual director, an octogenarian Jesuit I would describe as a spiritual master. I recommend this 449-page TAN Books edition, containing not only Father Caussade\u2019s treatise (100 or so pages) but -- even better for a literary soul -- an enormous collection of personal letters of spiritual guidance that he wrote to numerous women, mostly nuns or nun candidates, a few married women. They are quite individual depending on which specific person he is writing to, you get to know some of the women, as well as the author, indirectly through the letters. It\u2019s astonishing to me that this book, though written in the early 1700s and very much in the theistic Christian tradition, also seems resonant with Eastern spirituality and might be accessible to readers on a non-theistic path, as well as those on other theistic paths, who are open to Catholic Christian spiritual works.There's also something challenging but sometimes wonderful about the non-modernity of the translation I'm reading -- translated by Algar Thorold and edited by John Joyce S.J.-- it stretches the mind of a modern person. To appreciate it fully one has to kind of abandon oneself to this older form of faith to see where it goes. I argue with it, it makes me uncomfortable at times, and yet I\u2019ve gotten so much from it over the past four years. The book is also available in other translations, one alternatively titled The Sacrament of the Present Moment.",

It\u2019s a Mistery revealed to little ones. Highly recommended ",
            "This beautiful, extraordinary and timeless book by an 18th century author is one of the greatest mystical treatises of any time in any religion. It is to be most warmly recommended to all true and sincere students of mysticism. It radiates the warmth of St. Francis de Sales, touches in a uniquely loving and gentle way on the sufferings on the soul immersed in the dark night of the spirit, offers guidance on ways of contemplation and the attainment of true humility, which, as the author asserts, is the prerequisite of self-knowledge preparing the way for the love of God which the purified soul must enter through the cloud of unknowing. This book is my steady companion along with the Cloud of Unknowing, Rumi and The Hidden Words of Baha'u'llah."

        "desc": "In \"To America,\" Stephen E. Ambrose, one of the country's most influential historians, reflects on his long career as an American historian and explains what an historian's job is all about. He celebrates America's spirit, which has carried us so far. He confronts its failures and struggles. As always in his much acclaimed work, Ambrose brings alive the men and women, famous and not, who have peopled our history and made the United States a model for the world.Taking a few swings at today's political correctness, as well as his own early biases, Ambrose grapples with the country's historic sins of racism, its neglect and ill treatment of Native Americans, and its tragic errors (such as the war in Vietnam, which he ardently opposed on campus, where he was a professor). He reflects on some of the country's early founders who were progressive thinkers while living a contradiction as slaveholders, great men such as Washington and Jefferson. He contemplates the genius of Andrew Jackson's defeat of a vastly superior British force with a ragtag army in the War of 1812. He describes the grueling journey that Lewis and Clark made to open up the country, and the building of the railroad that joined it and produced great riches for a few barons.,Ambrose explains the misunderstood presidency of Ulysses S. Grant, records the country's assumption of world power under the leadership of Theodore Roosevelt, and extols its heroic victory of World War II. He writes about women's rights and civil rights and immigration, founding museums, and nation- building. He contrasts the presidencies of Dwight Eisenhower, John F. Kennedy, Richard Nixon, and Lyndon B. Johnson. Throughout, Ambrose celebratesthe unflappable American spirit.,Most important, Ambrose writes about writing history. \"The last five letters of the word 'history' tell us that it is an account of the past that is about people and what they did, which is what makes it the most fascinating of subjects.\",\"To America\" is an instant classic for all those interested in history, patriotism, and the love of writing.",

            "This book was published in 2002 shortly before Ambrose died. It is an excellent treatise on many of the forty historical book subjects that he covered in his career. Ambrose is what might be called a \u2018popular\u2019 historian. And his passion - judging by the number of books - would be military campaigns. D-Day and Band of Brothers are amongst the best of them. These books also led to his museum creation and fundraising for D-Day and many friendships with veterans of all stripes. If you have seen any of his interviews in various documentaries, the seriousness and passion with which he speaks is quite engaging. Interestingly enough I\u2019m more drawn to his other works - those that involve the American landscape. His book on Lewis and Clark called \u2018Undaunted Courage\u2019 and his book \u2018Crazy Horse and Custer\u2019 are amongst my favorites by any author. These books ooze with images of landscapes and wildness - just beautiful and romantic in an American West way. Ambrose is a bit old school especially regarding his patriotic fervor in defending Eisenhower. As a young author he became Eisenhower\u2019s biographer and got to know him very well. But despite his subjectivity, Ambrose\u2019s heart is in the right place and his sins - if any exist - would be ones of opinion. His books do not avoid unseemly subjects. I do not agree with Ambrose when he says that Nixon was actually one of America\u2019s better presidents - as measured by political accomplishments. Ambrose probably had a clearer eyed view than myself because he clearly did not like the guy, called him a liar repeatedly. Nixon clearly did not like Ambrose calling him \u201cone of those leftist historians\u201d. I haven\u2019t read Ambrose\u2019s biographical trilogy on Nixon only because I have read another biography on Nixon and that is enough for me. I am sure it would be good. Ambrose provides some excellent assessments of the presidencies of Jefferson, Grant and TR. He contends that Jefferson was a great intellect but not a great leader. Grant was one of the great presidents and this was not a popular opinion forty years ago. He was one of the only historians who publicly said so way back then. Ambrose noted that TR\u2019s greatest gifts to America were the conservation movement that he started and that TR foresaw with great clarity America\u2019s need to be a global power. In two short chapters at the end of the book, Ambrose tries to address the racism and misogyny that he witnessed and that were especially prevalent in his times. He spoke of his mother who could have run and won a position in the Wisconsin legislature but his father - a Navy doctor - was against it. 4.5 stars.",
            "My father gave me this book last summer before my husband and I embarked upon a long cross-country road trip. I did actually begin the book in the car along the way, but didn't finish it until this past week. I have a mixed opinion about the book, complicated even farther by my English teacher reaction to some articles I've since read about Ambrose's writing and alleged plagiarism in some of his books (articles I plan to use in class for those serious discussions with my students about what it actually means to plagiarize). So...let me try to sort it out. I liked the book, initially. I liked the idea of a long and storied historian writing his reflections of a life spent studying the history of his country. I liked that the book was divided into chapters dealing with some of the most controversial issues in our nation's history, and that Ambrose seemed to (like me) find the hidden areas of gray in the diabolically opposing sides to the arguments. I liked that he recognized, as we do in the film CRASH, the novel OF MICE AND MEN, and the philosophical discussions of Socrates's dissidents in PLATO'S REPUBLIC that in this human condition we are all both victim and predator. That no one is immune from bad decisions or incapable of good ones. But...I felt that the book veered away from that organization, becoming a self-indulgent litany of Ambrose's own life and writing. And I didn't like the final chapters where he tried to incorporate his own life into the history he writes. I don't think it was successful. I don't think it worked. So...as I ended the book I found myself tired and frustrated, and ready to put it down. In final retrospect, I have to wonder if Ambrose himself (with the accusation and controversy surrounding his writing) wasn't simply a human reflection of the history he analyzed--not altogether evil, not altogether good. Just human, poor, weak, and capable of miraculous things.",
            "An amazing book! A personal reflection on American history from a leading US Historian. Goes into showing the American spirit and what made this country great. Lewis and Clarke's expedition, manifest destiny, and the war of 1812 are just some points. Stephen Ambrose seamlessly blends historical fact with his view on how these events forged who we are today as a country, a society, and a free people! Truly a book every American should read!",
            "For fans of the late historian (Ambrose died in 2002) this book is something of a treat as it tells how he became an historian (he was a pre-med student initially), how he got into the writing game, and the stories behind all the books he had written. Throughout the book there is always a theme of transition and progression, not just in the sense of America as a nation, but in Ambrose as a scholar, writer, man and citizen, as he studies the history of the nation and its peoples, he progresses from what everyone knows about history, to what he was taught about history, to what he learned about history. For example, everyone knows how the west was won, and he was taught by his professors how America stole from the Indians and tried to exterminate them, but he learned that the Americans of the time did nothing more or worse than what the Indians did themselves, though he does find much to criticize about the way in which America was unable to rise above the passions of their age and live up to the ideals we embodied in our own founding documents, a dichotomy which continues to this day.Throughout the book he portrays himself as liberal (though he was stung by Nixon's criticism that he was just another liberal) and left-leaning, but he more bases that on his pacifistic stance during the Vietnam War, and yet as I read of his optimism and patriotism, I thought he perhaps might not be as liberal as he thought. Being adverse to war does not make a person liberal, just sensible, and many of the many of the most ardent opponents to war (as opposed to being anti-war) have been military men, for they are the only ones who truly know, as Sherman pointed out, that war is hell. Though a self-defined dove, he nevertheless consistently praises the abilities and morality of the American fighting man, even during the War in the Pacific, in which America's racism matched that of their Japanese opponents, the extreme enmity in that theater, however, was set aside (at least by the Americans, Japan has yet to admit, much less come to terms with its own aggression and racism) when MacArthur ruled Japan and set the stage for the emergence of a free and democratic Japan. MacArthur's enlightened rule of Japan echoes the command Eisenhower (Ambrose's favorite subjuct and his pick for American of the Century) held in Germany, with him instructing the German press corps that they were to be agents of the truth, not stooges of the government, that they should even criticize him in the press. Like Japan, Germany is the democratic bastion it is today because they were defeated by America, not conquered by the USSR.Ambrose brings an even hand to history, criticizing America's mis-steps, and yet doing so without condemnation. He attributes much of that to his association with former President Eisenhower, who he interviewed weekly (or more) for his multi-volume biographies and other books about WW2. Without that association, he feared, he might have gone the way of other liberals of his time, spiraling into an abyss where America became an evil empire guilty of heinous crimes and responsible for all the ills of the world. It was impossible, he write, to know Eisenhower and not learn to honor and respect the country. In assessing America's unique nature upon the world stage, Ambrose points out three major triumphs for America:*the creation of our democratic republic in the 18th Century*the abolition of slavery and the holding together of our Union in the 19th Century*the crushing of totalitarianism in the 20th CenturyUnfortunately, having no crystal ball, and living only long enough to glimpse the rise of the world's greatest enemy of freedom and human rights, he was unable to predict what America's greatest triumph, or failure, would be in our fourth, and perhaps final, century. And yet, he felt, there might be some hope for the future, because of our accomplishments in bringing freedom and democracy to the oppressed peoples of the world, he wrote, we have made the world a better place and will continue to do so.While this book will appeal to the history buff, especially someone vitally concerned with the events and personalities of the Second World War (though Ambrose makes an argument that it was The Great War, Part 2), and is certainly required reading for any of Ambrose's many fans, it is also fascinating to anyone interested in America's history, or to the process of studying and making sense of history. Two things I took away from this book are that history is the study of people, their decisions and the consequences of those decisions, and that we are all, even now, writing the history of the future, that the consequences of our decisions will either redeem us or damn us, even though we will not live to receive either calumny or praise. ",
            "No doubt many of you have memories of history class as a dry uninteresting subject where memorizing some key characters and dates was what was required to make it through to the next level. Today history is one of my favorite genres to read and learn and I've discovered that there are actually writers who have the ability to make history interesting as well as educational. In To America: Personal Reflections of an Historian, Stephen E. Ambrose, one of the country's most influential historians, reflects on his long career as an American historian and explains what an historian's job is all about. He also shares insights and behind the scenes looks at how he pulls together the good and the bad about our predecessors as he writes about their stories with triumphs and tragedies and all that goes with that. I have read several of his books and have found them to be captivating in how he presents his thoroughly researched topics and actually brings history to life. He takes a few swings at the political correctness craze of today, as well as his own early biases, as he grapples with the country's historic sins of racism, its neglect and ill treatment of Native Americans, and its tragic errors. He reflects on some of the country's early founders who were progressive thinkers while living a contradiction as slaveholders including Washington and Jefferson. He contemplates many of the key events in our history, many of which are contained in his books such as the stunning victory over the British in the War of 1812, the grueling journey of Lewis and Clark to open up the newly acquired territory to the west, and the building of the transcontinental railroad that joined it and greatly reduced the time to safely travel from the east to the west.The author explains and records America's assumption of world power under the leadership of Theodore Roosevelt, and extols its heroic victory in World War II. He writes about women's rights and civil rights and immigration, founding museums, and nation- building. He contrasts the presidencies of Dwight Eisenhower, John F. Kennedy, Richard Nixon, and Lyndon B. Johnson and the misunderstood presidency of Ulysses S. Grant. Throughout, Ambrose celebrates the unflappable American spirit. Throughout all of this, Ambrose writes about writing history. To America is an instant classic for all those interested in history, patriotism, and the love of writing.",
            "In this random collection of things Ambrose wants to talk about, he tries to leave behind his school of Old White Male History, but he just can't. Nor he can avoid a sometimes stunningly Amerocentric attitude. When Americans win a war or a battle, they do it with more glory and bravery than was ever seen before in history. When they accomplish some feat, it is better than any feat that ever came before. And when they form a hatred towards someone, that too is stronger than anyone else's hatred. (I might suggest he take a closer look at Asian relations.) Most of the book is made up of reflections on the traditional stuff: wars, presidents, and of the few of these I read, it was more than obvious he wrote about them not only out of personal interest but because he had done significant research on them throughout his career. Once or twice he tackled topics of social history, and it was also clear they held only a passing curiosity for him. Women's lib was almost entirely about his mother and two wives' experiences in the home and at work with almost no commentary on female society as a whole in the US (let alone how their experiences differed wildly by class and race) and wound up congratulating the US on leading the world in this field while blatantly ignoring decades of data on how European society is ahead of us by leagues when it comes to women's equality in the workplace. But I digress. I did learn some things. I liked reading about Teddy Roosevelt, but in the end, I had to put this book down before I threw it across the room.",
            "Stephen Ambrose gives some overall thoughts on what America actually is, using his decades of scholarship, study and writing to back himself up. He defends several critiques of American history: the bombing of Japan in WWII, for example, or the myth of Native American harmony with nature. He speaks at length about the work involved in history scholarship, and through his description, his love becomes the reader's as well. Must say, I'm a bit irritated at Ambrose on occasion in this book (God rest his soul). He argues that no one could find fault with Western expansionism, or else they'd have to tell the immigrants and surveyors they had to go back to New York, Boston or Chicago rather than push westward, taking the natives' lands, and who would agree to say such a thing? I would. He also compares the pleasure of blowing a steam engine horn to the pleasure of an orgasm. Yeah. He lost me right there, too. But there's plenty else he says worth listening to. I don't know if this was the last book he wrote before succumbing to lung cancer in 2002 or so, but it's a fitting elegy regardless. Nixon dismissively referred to Ambrose, the man who'd written a three-volume biography of him as evenhanded as anyone could possibly pull off, as just another liberal historian. Wuh. Dick, pal, that guy was in your court more than you'll ever know. He was in all of our courts. That's an American. ",
            "With such masterpieces as Undaunted Courage, Band of Brothers and D-Day, it is difficult to write a negative review of Stephen Ambrose's epitaph contemplation To America: Personal Reflections of An Historian. Ambrose applies 21st century thought to 18th century events, a sin by any historian's standards. Within the first 5 pages, Ambrose stoops to discounting Thomas Jefferson, the author of the Declaration of Independence, as a racist, a bigot and an intellectual coward (how can any historian discount the structure of slavery in 18th century aristocracy or the fact that Jefferson's prominence was a result of it? - albeit a horrific scar on American history). Although the other end of the spectrum is represented, such overpowering treatment continues throughout the book.One bright spot in the book is the objective treatment of Richard Nixon, although the subject is not susceptible to Ambrose's disappointing jabs. It is important for the reader to take this book with a teaspoon of salt, the tag-line title must be considered, that this is Ambrose's personal reflection. His decision to keep his own opinion at bay in his previous work was a wise one as Ambrose seems more determined to end his legacy as a controversialist (evidenced by his frequent recounting of his own protest attendance) than an objective voice of history.I would advise potential readers to the leave To America on the shelf and read, and re-read, Ambrose's 25 other published treasures.

        "desc": "From the palace hotels of the elite to cheap lodging houses, residential hotels have been an element of American urban life for nearly two hundred years. Since 1870, however, they have been the target of an official war led by people whose concept of home does not include the hotel. Do these residences constitute an essential housing resource, or are they, as charged, a public nuisance?,Living Downtown,, the first comprehensive social and cultural history of life in American residential hotels, adds a much-needed historical perspective to this ongoing debate. Creatively combining evidence from biographies, buildings and urban neighborhoods, workplace records, and housing policies, Paul Groth provides a definitive analysis of life in four price-differentiated types of downtown residence. He demonstrates that these hotels have played a valuable socioeconomic role as home to both long-term residents and temporary laborers. Also, the convenience of hotels has made them the residence of choice for a surprising number of Americans, from hobo author Boxcar Bertha to Calvin Coolidge.,Groth examines the social and cultural objections to hotel households and the increasing efforts to eliminate them, which have led to the seemingly irrational destruction of millions of such housing units since 1960. He argues convincingly that these efforts have been a leading contributor to urban homelessness.,This highly original and timely work aims to expand the concept of the American home and to recast accepted notions about the relationships among urban life, architecture, and the public management of residential environments.",

            "Today, zoning codes (and most people, I suspect) think of hotels as wholly separate from apartments: in fact, when Airbnb began to blur the line between them by helping people rent out their houses short-term, it became very controversial. But Groth shows this separation is very recent and quite artificial: in the first quarter of the 20th century, the majority of San Francisco's hotel rooms were occupied by long-term lodgers.Groth seeks to answer two questions: First, why were hotels so popular? High-end hotels were appealing to the upper class because the huge staffs of luxury hotels freed the rich from the need to have servants to assist with menial tasks, in addition, hotel restaurants were included in rent, and thus meant that people didn't have to worry about cooking. (As labor-saving devices reduced the need for servants and made cooking easier, I suspect this was much less of an advantage in the late 20th century). Mid-priced hotels were appealing to the middle class because they eliminated the need to buy furniture and cook meals. Hotels were especially useful for young singles who weren't ready to buy houses, because compared to boarding with a family, they were closer to downtown and allowed tenants more privacy.And to a greater extent than modern apartments, the hotel industry created a wide range of low-end options. In the 1920s, a low-end laborer or hobo might rent a minimally furnished private room with no cooking facilities for 40 cents a night (roughly $5 today), a cubicle for half that much, and a dry space on a floor for a dime a day (or a bit over a dollar today). Of course, these facilities were vile by modern standards - cleanliness was often questionable, and dozens of tenants might share a restroom. Still, these options compare favorably to sleeping on the street as homeless people now do near where I live.Groth then focuses on what went wrong: why did the residential hotel industry collapse? Here, he focuses primarily on the low end of the industry, which was wiped out in large part by government interference. For example:*Building codes designed to improve sanitation put a floor under prices, for example, a hotel with one bathroom for every 15 tenants (a common 1920s standards) obviously costs a little more than one with one bathroom for every 30.*Zoning laws that separated uses both reduced the number of hotels (by keeping them out of new, house-dominated suburban areas) and made them less appealing (by ensuring that hotels were within walking distance of less retail than in the past).*The Federal Housing Administration (FHA) aided houses and even apartment complexes in newer areas, but did not aid residential hotels, and redlined older, mixed-use areas that such hotels were most common.*Urban renewal wiped out many cities' lower-income downtown neighborhoods, which tended to have the most hotels. And as cities widened streets to favor the automobile, they made downtown streets less appealing places to live.*The deinstitutionalization of the mentally ill made low-end hotels very unappealing places to live, as the former patients flooded cheap hotels.In addition, some market forces reduced demand for hotels- the growth of downtown office buildings meant that business outbid hotels for the best downtown real estate. Also as blue collar jobs moved to suburbia, blue collar people moved with them.",
            "Fascinating social work/ urban planning themes. Didn't get to finish it all, but was surprised by 2 connections to current events. Back in 1910, temp workers had it hard, just like today. They could rent a hot bed in which another worker had just slept and left for work. Another connection is the growing trend of apartments and townhouses going up in downtown Columbus,Ohio. Urban areas were formerly mixed, then it was thought that mixing was not good, and now it is back!When I was 3 or 4 years old, my dad rented office space on the second floor of a downtown building. There was a store downstairs, and we went up a long narrow set of stairs to the floor where his office was located. Further up, on the top floor, there were apartments where recent immigrants lived. The women would be hollering in a strange language, and foreign cooking smells would drift down the stairs. I always wondered about those people, because I never saw them. I think that is how I started being fascinated by the concept of living downtown.",
            "Although today hotels are thought of as places for travelers, at its most basic level a hotel is simply a rented room, an apartment without a kitchen. For much of American history, the 'huddled masses' filling the cities found homes not in detached houses, but in residential hotels. Buildings giant and small, dilapidated and grand, they catered to the rich and poor alike. Living Downtown examines what lives were like, as lived in different classes of hotels, and tracks their struggle through the 20th century as they became the target of reformers. This is a social history of urban life in American cities' boomtime.Suburbanized America thinks of apartments and the like as exceptions to the rule of privately-owned homes, but as Living Downtown reveals, communal life has a strong history in the nation. Wealthy families saw in hotels a place to enjoy servants without the bother of managing them, ambitious middle-class couples could claim a fashionable address and the opportunity to network with their betters, and the working class found a certain independence in cheap rents that allowed them to move easily in pursuit of work, or maintain lodgings even if they were laid off for a short time. Hotels ranged from grand palaces to 2-penny a day flophouses that even the indigent could afford, provided they found an odd job now and again. Hotels also offered more inherent opportunities for socialization, those midrange and above typically came with cafes, restaurants, and shops attached, the wealthy could even find rooms reserved for smoking and lounging about. Lowly flophouses wouldn't sport such facilities, of course, but they were enmeshed in an urban fabric that catered to the needs of their guests.Living Downtown finds in hotels abounding interest. After discussing the lifestyles and attractions of the different classes of hotels, Groth moves on to hotels' place in the overall American fabric. Hotels attracted negative attention beginning the Progressive era, where helpful reformers took it upon themselves to clean up American cities and inflict morality upon them. The idea that rich society wives could lounge about in hotel parlors, not even bothering to keep house, was too much for reformers to bear, as was the inevitable use of hotels of all kinds as playgrounds for prostitution. Establishing and advancing the ideal of American society being rooted in privately-held, detached homes, the progressive era saw hotels first constricted in growth by regulation, then smothered altogether by aggressive zoning laws that would eventually attempt to deconstruct American cities, turning smartly-organized social arrangements into sprawl. Granted, there were areas that needed attention -- especially in the area of waste sanitation in poorer hotels -- but more has been lost than gained by idealistic zeal. In addition to social history, there's a little discussion of business practices.In 21st century America, where the market for cheap housing has been all but obliterated by aggressive Federal support for welfare tenements of the kind that destroy cities, Living Downtown is a vivid reminder of the variety of housing approaches that once existed, and a look back into American cities when they were truly dynamic from the ground up.",

            "This is a book about the history of hotel living. There are a lot of pictures and building plans. The book focuses a lot on SF and the SROs and rooming houses. The book traces the development of hotel living as a reasonable, convenient way to live in an urban area. The book also discusses the historical demonization of this type of housing, in favor of single family stand alone houses, or single family apartments that have their own kitchens and bathrooms. Building codes made collective living in hotels harder. Codes favored units with bathrooms and kitchens. I really liked this book. I think it is important when we try to think about how people can live comfortably in small spaces in large dense urban areas.",

            "My historical fondness for this author remains undiminished. This was written in the mid 90's, a time when I was discovering Raymond Carver and Jim Harrison. Dubus is unique in his ability to enter the female brain (of course how would I know, but it feels so real). These stories are set on the east coast, often in Massachusetts, which I've been visiting for my job these recent years. As such, these took on new life for me. A time before computers and cellphones, this was a time capsule of sorts and, oddly, a reminiscence of a period in my own reading life. The experiences in my own life (young children at home, various and vibrant family members now aged or gone) when I read this author come flooding back as I read him anew. I'm like that with music too. But, I digress - these stories are beautifully wrought, even when tragically sad. The same characters show up in various guises in these stories, told from different POVs, which I always enjoy. The signature piece is the title story, about a man in a wheelchair as he enters a bar of strangers and becomes enamored of the staff. This story is told from the un-married bartender's point of view, a lady in her 40s struggling with her destiny and fearful of what she's becoming. I recall a picture of the author in a wheelchair, and this story centers on a paraplegic, and captures his (and his caretakers') experiences so remarkably, I suspect the author knows of which he writes on a very personal level.

E non \u00e8 forse proprio la fiducia (in se stessi e nell'altro) l'inizio di ogni possibile guarigione ?Cos\u00ec si fa un passo e un altro ancora, e pu\u00f2 accadere  qualcosa di imprevedibile che giunge da fuori e ci riempie. Qualcosa che cambia il modo in cui vediamo ci\u00f2 che vediamo. Qualcosa che ci permette di vedere ci\u00f2 che non vediamo E allora in quella notte , fonda , si osservano di nuovo le stelle .229 L'amore che arriva  a notte fonda  \u00e8 un amore che richiede sforzo.

Non stiamo pi\u00f9 parlando di felicit\u00e0, ma di gioia - che \u00e8 una felicit\u00e0 inclusiva anche della conoscenza del dolore",
            "Un'assoluta onest\u00e0,come il traduttore Nicola Manuppelli titola la postfazione, riprendendo il canone estetico dichiarato da Andre Dubus in un'intervista. In questo libro ancora pi\u00f9 che negli altri Dubus trascura ogni artificio letterario per seguire i propri pensieri in forma di racconto. Questo non avviene a scapito della qualit\u00e0 della scrittura che al contrario risulta trasparente e priva di quelle costruzioni che a volte risultano ridicole, se non sostenute da un contenuto adeguato.Le relazioni fra uomini e donne, i legami familiari o la loro assenza occupano un posto centrale nella sua scrittura. Uomini e donne si cercano, si incontrano, si tradiscono, si lasciano, cercano altre compagnie, con un turn over che \u00e8 oltre lo standard a cui sono abituata, forse perch\u00e8 negli USA c'\u00e8 una maggiore mobilit\u00e0 nel mondo del lavoro che porta la gente a spostarsi di pi\u00f9 e questo non aiuta i rapporti duraturi. Sembra che la gente si conosca al bar, si conosca in senso biblico e magari faccia figli prima di scambiare quelle chiacchiere sufficienti per capire che si cercano cose diverse ed \u00e8 opportuno usare metodi anticoncezionali. Si vede la bella famiglia americana benestante da film, che vive in villa con giardino fuori dalla metropoli, la bella signora che torna a casa e viene minacciata dai cattivoni. Altri stereotipi si rivelano fondati, l'uso abbondante di superalcolici e i fucili come oggetto quotidiano, tanto che \u00e8 normale che un ragazzino spari a una figura vista nel buio del giardino senza sapere di chi si tratti, anche lodato dai genitori.Leggendo si percepisce che si tratta di un'opera di et\u00e0 matura, perch\u00e8 i racconti e gli argomenti hanno un sapore definitivo, si racconta la fatica che si fa nell'andare avanti, si riflette sulle perdite, su quello che si sarebbe potuto perdere e che ci \u00e8 stato graziato (Benedizioni), sul necessario atteggiamento maturo e aperto che ci consente di raccogliere i doni insperati che la vita ci offre, quando non ci si contava pi\u00f9 (Ballando a notte fonda). Inaspettatamente, si vedono figure maschili nella loro fragilit\u00e0, come era l'autore al tempo di questo libro.Nell'ambito dell'analisi sincera, c'\u00e8 un interessante racconto sulla responsabilit\u00e0, tema non dei pi\u00f9 frequenti, in cui una donna riflette con crudezza su un incidente e la morte di una persona che non \u00e8 compianta, perch\u00e8, sia pure non volendo, aveva messo in pericolo altre vite. La donna ha ragione, ma in questi termini diretti \u00e8 una lettura inconsueta.",
            "Libro di solitudini e di frasi asciutte. Di relazioni sfilacciate in tradimenti evitabili e banali. Di redenzioni.Dubus mi fa un effetto strano, spesso i suoi racconti mi scorrono addosso come aria gelida, che non lascia nulla se non un brivido di qualcosa di bellissimo e glaciale che mi \u00e8 passato di fianco.Alle volte rimango invece rapito dal dramma e vivo il racconto come si svolgesse sotto gli occhi - penso a Benedizioni, o al bellissimo racconto di chiusura.Forse la fretta di procedere mi ha fatto perdere la percezione dello spessore di alcuni racconti, che andrebbero letti pi\u00f9 lentamente per apprezzare l\u2019incedere dharmico che a volte li illumina - illuminati da luce interna, che si manifesta non per frasi poetiche o argomenti mistici, ma per una attenta giustapposizione di frasi semplici che costruiscono, come un puzzle, una immagine che \u00e8 ben di pi\u00f9 della somma di pezzi i cui contorni potrebbero sembrare inutili, o superflui.",
            "Nella scena ci sono io, attorno all'una di notte, che cammino avanti e indietro per casa con in mano questo libro di Dubus. Ho finito di leggerlo da un paio di giorni, ma ancora non ho capito quanto mi sia piaciuto. O se mi sia piaciuto. Dubus, riflettevo, \u00e8 uno scrittore che procede per accumulo. Leggi il primo racconto e ti piace. Leggi il secondo e ti dici, fra te e te, che ti sembra di averlo gi\u00e0 letto. Arrivi al terzo e sei sicuro che quello che ti sta raccontando \u00e8 la stessa cosa del racconto precedente e di quello ancora prima. I nomi cambiano, i luoghi anche, ma Dubus ti racconta sempre la stessa storia. Ancora e ancora. Eppure non ti stanca Dubus, non ti stanca non perch\u00e9 abbia un modo particolare di raccontare le sue storie \u2014 il suo stile \u00e8 molto semplice, ma n\u00e9 minimalista alla Carver, n\u00e9 telegrafico alla Hemingway, giusto per citare due autori a cui potremmo accostarlo \u2014, non ti stanca perch\u00e9 di storia in storia Dubus ti fa scorgere un po' di pi\u00f9 di quello che ti vuole raccontare. E quello che Dubus ti vuole raccontare \u00e8 come vanno davvero le cose l\u00ec fuori, nella vita reale.Mentre camminavo per casa all'una di notte, con questo libro in mano, ho pensato che un po' di cose questi racconti me le hanno insegnate. Dovrebbe essere sempre cos\u00ec, se leggi un certo tipo di letteratura (ne avevo scritto a proposito nella recensione al primo volume della Recherche, da qualche parte la trovate), ma non sempre lo \u00e8. Questa raccolta di Dubus ti insegna qualcosa sulle relazioni, principalmente quelle amorose. I protagonisti, volendo semplificare, sono sempre un uomo e una donna, che si amano o che cercano l'amore, che intessono relazioni sbagliate o che ad un certo punto prendono strade differenti, persone che si perdono e che a volte si ritrovano, ma molto pi\u00f9 spesso no. Dubus le osserva, le studia, le descrive, e quando decide di raccontarcelo, lo fa senza indugiare, senza giustificare comportamenti, senza addolcire situazioni. Sono storie di tutti i giorni, storie che chiunque, dai 15 anni in su, potrebbe raccontare: sono vicende in cui i protagonisti fanno delle azioni e ne subiscono le conseguenze, fanno delle scelte e vedono la loro vita prendere un'altra strada rispetto a quella prevista. E le scelte che Dubus decide di inserire in questa raccolta sono quelle che, per un motivo o per l'altro, condizionano completamente la nostra esistenza: sono quelle riguardanti la vita di coppia, la ricerca di un partner o di un nuovo partner, di un'occasione o di qualcosa di pi\u00f9 duraturo. E in ognuna di queste vicende Dubus sembra quasi avvertirci: c'\u00e8 del dolore da sopportare. Tantissimo dolore, qualsiasi scelta tu faccia.Le parole che pi\u00f9 ricorrono in questi quattordici racconti sono carne (intesa come corpo), lacrime, dolore, desiderio. Ma anche peccato e pentimento. Ogni racconto ha una tristezza intrinseca, una tristezza che non trasforma in malinconiche le vicende raccontate, ma una tristezza che il lettore \u00e8 chiamato a provare dentro di s\u00e9, a ricordarla quasi, dato che nella maggior parte dei casi avr\u00e0 gi\u00e0 avuto modo di provarla nella sua vita privata. Dubus scava in situazioni sempre simili, \u00e8 vero, ma di racconto in racconto troviamo sempre un motivo in pi\u00f9 per andare avanti, un motivo in pi\u00f9 per cui i protagonisti devono andare avanti nella loro storia. \u00c8 una parabola ascendente che dal primo racconto, il pi\u00f9 buio e senza alcuna possibile uscita, cerca di raggiungere una possibile risoluzione.Questo fino al racconto finale. Ballando a notte fonda, il racconto che d\u00e0 il titolo alla raccolta, \u00e8 un piccolo capolavoro, e per certi versi mi ha ricordato Cattedrale di Carver, un altro racconto fra i pi\u00f9 belli di questo tipo di letteratura. Ballando a notte fonda \u00e8 il racconto che pi\u00f9 di tutti ci mostra che uno spiraglio forse c'\u00e8: non tutte le storie sono fatte per finire, e anche se alcune sono gi\u00e0 finite c'\u00e8 ancora davanti a s\u00e9 tanto di quel tempo per vederne nascere di nuove. \u00c8 un messaggio semplicistico riassunto cos\u00ec, ma non lo \u00e8 in chiusura di una raccolta che attraverso quattordici racconti ci ha mostrato i lati pi\u00f9 dolorosi delle relazioni. Ed \u00e8 un finale che non vuole essere del tutto accondiscendente: potrebbe esserci il lieto fine, ma non \u00e8 detto. Un finale aperto, che se da una parte ci fa vedere la possibilit\u00e0 che qualcosa accada, dall'altro ci mostra anche le difficolt\u00e0 nel riuscire a guadagnarselo. Niente viene infatti regalato ai protagonisti di Dubus, cos\u00ec come niente viene regalato nella vita reale: c'\u00e8 la difficolt\u00e0 nell'andare avanti, nel costruire relazioni, nel farle crescere e nel non abbandonarsi in esse.Mentre andavo avanti e indietro per casa mi son detto che, se ho speso tre giorni per leggere questo libro e altri due per pensarci sopra, forse qualcosa dentro di me \u00e8 scattato ancor prima che capissi se questa raccolta mi \u00e8 piaciuta oppure no.",
            "Non conoscevo Dubus, ho letto questo libro grazie al consiglio di una cara amica. Ed \u00e8 stata una bellissima scoperta. Dubus scrive benissimo, alcuni dei racconti di cui \u00e8 composto il libro sono stupendi. Alcuni personaggi tornano da un racconto all\u2019altro, anche se magari osservati da un\u2019altra angolazione. Dubus scava nei dettagli della vita di tutti i giorni, nell\u2019animo dei personaggi, nelle situazioni. Scrive benissimo Manuppelli, nella post-fazione:\u201cUna volta ancora, una volta di pi\u00f9, un\u2019ultima danza quando tutto sembra spento.

The question of how people first came to the Americas is now thrown wide open: the best guess is that they arrived from a variety of places, at many different times and by many different routes. Dillehay describes who the earliest settlers are likely to have been, where they may have landed, how they dispersed across two continents, what their technology and folkways may have been like, and how they interacted with the famous Clovis culture once thought to represent the earliest settlers.",

Timothy Egan's book Short Nights of the Shadow Catcher: The Epic Life and Immortal Photographs of Edward Curtis sparked my interest in American Indian cultures, so I decided that I had best begin at the beginning. Thomas Dillehay proves to my satisfaction that the beginning was a very, very long time ago--perhaps as much as 15,000 - 20,000 years before the present. I had vague school memories of the Clovis big-game hunting culture that supposedly peopled the Americas sometime around 11,200 years ago. That culture certainly existed and played a major role in North America, but Dillehay marshals an impressive set of data from dozens of South American excavations to demonstrate that humans were here earlier and possibly made more than one migration out of Asia. The earliest Americans were not as specialized as the Clovis nomads, but rather exploited a wide range of plants, small game and marine creatures using multiple stone, wood and bone technologies. There is even evidence for herbal medicine use and extensive trading. While technical, this book is very accessible and readable, even for the layman. Highly recommended for anyone interested in exploring early human history and culture.",
            "quote from 'The Scientist'https://www.the-scientist.com/news/mo...Thirteen years ago, archeologist Tom Dillehay was teaching at the Universidad Austral de Chile in Valdivia and pursuing his interest in early Andean cultures. Then a student asked the young researcher to identify several large bones found at Monte Verde, a wet and boggy site in south central Chile. Dillehay recognized the bones immediately as belonging to a mastodon.Dillehay had no way of knowing that his exploration of the site where the prehistoric animal had been butchered by Indian hunters would challenge long-held theories about the peopling of the Americas - or threaten his own budding career.What we found was really the best window we've ever encountered on the ways of early hunter-gatherers. It's the Machu Pichu of the Ice Age, says Dillehay, now at the University of Kentucky, Lexington. Other archeologists are equally enthusiastic, calling Monte Verde the most important site in the Americas to come along in the last 60 years. For beneath the peaty bogs of Monte Verde lie 14 wooden hut foundations, wood and stone artifacts, a hunk of preserved mastodon muscle, animal skins, and masticated potatoes. There is even a human footprint.But an ancient habitation wasn't the only thing that Dillehay uncovered. His discovery plunged him unwittingly into a bitter and protracted debate among archeologists over the date of the first human settlement in North America. Most archeologists, based on evidence from a 1927 discovery in New Mexico, believe that the first humans came to the New World 12,000 years ago. In fact, adherence to that view has become almost a litmus test for acceptance into the profession. Unfortunately for Dillehay, many of the artifacts from Monte Verde date from 13,000 B.P. (before the present). And that 1,000-year difference would force him to wage a 10-year battle to preserve his professional reputation. ****** ... multiple migrations ... Early arrivals may have been proto-Mongoloids, later ones perhaps more like modern Mongoloids or Asians ... Two types of human skeletons, a robust form and a gracile form, apparently coexisted in early Holocen South America ... suggest that the earliest South Americans may not be morphologically linked with northeastern Asians or Siberians ... more closely resemble South Pacific and South Asian populations ... These results only add to the unanswered questions. And setting for a fantasy.http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Settleme...http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Verde******some fragments from first review:\u201c \u2026 36 miles from coast of southern Chile \u2026 a few days walk from both coast and mountains \u2026 20 foot long structure of wood and animals hides on banks of creek \u2026 framed with logs and planks staked to ground with wall of poles covered with animals hides \u2026 interiors divided by hide and pole walls that were tied together with reed cordage \u2026 each area had a fire pit \u2026 two large outdoor hearths \u2026 grinding stones \u2026 firewood \u2026wishbone shaped wooden uprights for mastodon carcass butchering \u2026 medicinal plants from coast and mountains \u2026 seaweed chaws \u2026 wild potatoes salt \u2026 rounded stones converted to tools \u2026 bitumen for fastening stone tools to wooden hafts \u2026 bone digging tools and gouges \u2026 bifacially flaked projectile points \u2026 grooved sling stones \u2026 most stone tools extremely simple rocks slightly modified by ivory batons \u2026\u201d",
            "If you picked up Dillehay's book to get a detailed analysis of Monte Verde, his infamous archaeological site, you will be disappointed. While he does delve into some of the key points about the site, this book is more of a cursory examination of the early archaeological sites found in South America as it relates to the ongoing debate regarding the arrival of the First Americans. At the present moment, there are two leading theories regarding the arrival of the indigenous populations of the Americas: Clovis First and Coastal Migration Theory. Dillehay's book presents both in a clear format and presents thought-provoking questions for both sides of the debate. While it is clear that Dillehay's research points to the Coastal Migration as the leading answer, he suggests that upon arrival to the Isthmus of Panama the answer is somewhat muddled in that there are archaeological sites on both the Atlantic and Pacific coasts. Like many archaeologists, Dillehay suggests that there were multiple routes to the Americas and that these did not occur at the same time. This is a great cursory read for archaeologists looking to get their feet wet in South American archaeology and it will challenge your thinking regarding the ongoing debate. For the layperson, the book might seem a bit daunting with all of the archaeological terminology, but I think it is well worth spending your time reading how real life archaeology is constructed. "

Veronica is an aspiring historian living in present-day Los Angeles when she meets a mysterious man who may be heir to the Russian throne. As she sets about investigating the legitimacy of his claim through a winding path of romance and deception, the ghosts of her own past begin to haunt her. Lena, a servant in the imperial Russian court of 1902, is approached by the desperate Empress Alexandra. After conceiving four daughters, the Empress is determined to sire a son and believes Lena can help her. Once elevated to the Romanov's treacherous inner circle, Lena finds herself under the watchful eye of the meddling Dowager Empress Marie. Charlotte, a former ballerina living in World War II occupied Paris, receives a surprise visit from a German officer. Determined to protect her son from the Nazis, Charlotte escapes the city, but not before learning that the officer's interest in her stems from his longstanding obsession with the fate of the Russian monarchy. Then as Veronica's passion intensifies, and her search for the true heir to the throne takes a dangerous turn, the reader learns just how these three vastly different women are connected. The Secret Daughter of the Tsar is thrilling from its first intense moments until its final, unexpected conclusion.",

            "Um....I had such high hopes for this book. The story line was so interesting. But!....The writing was horrible. It's like the author had random information she really wanted to throw in the book. The story would be going a long and then all of a sudden some useless information would come up making me confused. From the very start I knew how the book would end. No surprises, just a long drawn out story. When I was done reading the book I sat there trying to figure out how this book could have been improved. I think that if the author didn't have the story line of the present day and just the other two stories it would have been much better. The author could have had the present day narrating it then in the end reveal how it pertains to her. "

            "today marks the 100th anniversary of the death of the grand duchess anastasia nikolaevna and the immediate romanov family. to show my respect, i watched the film \u2018anastasia\u2019 and read this book. both of which are works of fiction (not to mention historically inaccurate), but oh, how i wish they were true!and before any enthused historians come at me, im rating this based on my enjoyment and not its factual basis. because i did enjoy this. there is a sort of romantic notion involved when thinking about a missing princess and long lost heir that i really loved with this story. there have been many conspiracy theories over the years when it comes to the romanov family, but i thought this particular tale was quite unique and mysterious. i loved the way the book was set up with three separate stories about three different characters across three crucial points in history. each story was wonderful in their own way, but i loved how it all came together at the end.i definitely recommend picking this up if you have any interest in the romanov family and are looking for a fun adventure, but dont mind if its not based on solid fact! \u21a0 3.5 stars",
            "your current lover of russian history is here *pops in out of thin air*",
            "What fun I had reading this book. The tragic story of the Tsarist Romanov family of Russia is one that fascinates me. Jennifer Laam has taken that historical background and made the Romanov's alive and vibrant through their fictitious servants and supposed heirs. I was completely taken in by the novel from the Prologue onward. This work of historical fiction is such a good read! The story line is fluent and gripping. I couldn't stand to be torn away and was really aggravated when anything or anyone interrupted my reading time. Skipping through time and through the viewpoints of different women, it held my interest completely. I had no trouble following the action and found my heart racing at some of the intimate and dangerous moments involved in the story.  Hard to say which was my favorite character in this one because there were several and so many out- standing moments in the book. I think I was most captivated by the Charlotte of the Paris/Nazi era. She was vulnerable in a beautiful way. While finding herself in dangerous situations, open to violence from several aspects, she maintained her courage and a sense of herself. She was a regal woman despite the facts surrounding her...decisive and intuitive. I liked her gentle heart. The suspense and mystery of this historical fiction was unexpected. It carried me swiftly through the book as I couldn't predict the conclusion until the very end. It's a very clever mouse trap of a novel! Made me wish there were a secret daughter of the tsar....or is there? I highly recommend this one. Beautifully researched. Fun to read. A great suspense/thriller/mystery that is compelling and insightful. Likable characters in realistic situations. I loved it! 5 stars Deborah/TheBookishDame",
            "This story seamlessly winds together the lives of three women from different times and places. The first half builds the mystery about the Russian Romanov family and the three main characters, and the second half is where the action and the tension really begin. My Kindle jumped from 50% to 90% completed and I hardly noticed! I loved how the book came together in the end, blending the mysteries from Russia in the early 1900s, to Paris in 1941, to present-day NYC, I honestly didn't see it coming.At first the women are timid, and I rooted for them to grow stronger. I switched between whose story I enjoyed the most, but I think it was Lena, the servant to the Russian empress. I enjoyed her romance the best, and I would've loved to read more about it. She seemed to be the youngest and least jaded by life. The other women endured struggles in the past, not uncommon to many women today, which will probably make their stories more poignant for many readers. Each of them eventually finds strength in themselves.You can feel the author's love for history and this particular time in history specifically. This book won me over!",
            "My opinion of this book bounced around like a pinball. I would find myself rolling my eyes and skimming Veronica chapters and vowing no more than two stars then change to Lena and Charlotte chapters and go up to four stars. This book is not a five star book and Veronica is the reason. The story has a good premise that a fifth daughter was born to Nicholas and Alexandra in 1902 and smuggled out for political reasons. To me this story is more plausible than one child survived the massacre. I know people who lived in the USSR in the 20's and 30's and there was no way anyone got out of that house alive. Our main character for some reason is Veronica. She is a professor and writing a biography of Empress Alexandra. She is also on the brink of being fired and desperate for a boyfriend despite having a recent relationship end badly. At least that's the impression when her cousin introduces her to Michael and she falls for his love of Russian history, music well everything. They fall into a heavy romance which made those chapters hard to stomach.Flashback to 1901 shortly after Grand Duchess Anastasia is born and we meet Lena. Lena works for the Empress Alexandra and is her current favourite. She longs to have a son to ensure the dynasty continues and Lena whose mother was a midwife has advice to offer her.In Paris 1942 we meet Charlotte a former ballerina and her son Laurent. They are desperate to flee occupied France and make it to the safety of her parents' house. Especially when a Nazi soldier shows up at her door saying mysterious things about her family.As I said before I liked the concept and really enjoyed the historical parts. Charlotte and Lena had enjoyable stories and I wanted them to get their own chapters. Their romances or lack there of were told well and weren't rammed down your throat like Veronica's was. If the story was their's alone it would've gotten four to five stars.Which brings me to Veronica. Sigh. Where do I begin? A young career woman who seems more worried about what others think. Feeling shame for being called the smart weird cousin. I hold that title in my own family and do so with pride! She allows herself to enter into a deep romance with someone she barely knows, finds out he used her and then because her grandmother and cousin say he's and good guy takes him back. Why did you have to ruin an otherwise good story? Veronica is not likeable for me I like to see strong independent female characters and she always waited for Michael or someone else to save her.Without her it could've been a better story. The ending I think is wishful thinking. I doubt the monarchy will be restored now or ever and most likely not to an American given the current climate between the two countries. But I gave it a neutral three stars, neither loved nor hated it. I disliked a couple characters but other than that not too bad of a read.",
            "The Secret Daughter of the Tsar is an alternate history of the Romanov family, Russia's last royal rulers. I was excited about this book because I am absolutely fascinated with Russia and its history, especially during the 20th century to present day. I'm always excited when I can find a historical fiction that takes on Russia (there aren't that many out there!!! why???). Alternate histories are a little bit more dicey for me usually. It's sometimes hard for me to get into the mindset of suspending my disbelief about histories that I know fairly well. In the case of this book, I totally ate this book up!The narrative is split between three main characters. There is Lena, servant to the Romanov family, who becomes a close confidante of the last Tsarina, Alexandra. There is Charlotte, a young woman in 1940s, who is being followed by a Nazi officer who seems to be convinced that she is someone who she's sure she isn't. Then there is Veronica, a Russian history professor at a small college, who meets a mysterious man who may be hiding a huge family secret. All three of these women come from very different walks of life and they are all really fascinating. There were a lot of really fantastic twists and turns surrounding these characters and I loved following them and putting the pieces together. The story of this book was fascinating. Yes, it's an alternate history but Lamm does a great job at making the story feel like it could be plausible. Many of us history lovers have heard about the various pretenders who claimed to be one of the Tsar's daughters (mostly Anastasia) but this book has a slightly different take, which makes it even more fascinating. Overall, this book has a great storyline and a really interesting take on an infamous family!"

I picked up this book as well as Yoni\u2019s Last Battle by Iddo Netanyahu and proceeded to read both books at the same time. The 34th anniversary of the Rescue at Entebbe told place when I was reading these two books.The book is a collection of letters collected from Yoni\u2019s friends and family after his death. Beginning in 1963 with the first letter to an Israeli schoolmate, he chronicles the time spent in America where he is forced to move because of his father\u2019s research. He knew at a very young age that his heart and soul belonged in Israel.In this time and age it was very refreshing to follow a man\u2019s maturing with his written words. It was a different time when people corresponded by letters. It made me stop and wonder if in the future we will have this documentation for our records of our heroes\u2019 thoughts, dreams and desires.Through his own letters, we see a man that does not blindly follow all superior\u2019s commands but finds a way to work within the system. Yoni by way of example gets his men to follow him because of their respect for the man. Yoni is very detail orientated and never leaves anything to fate, he checks and double checks.The last letter to his girlfriend is only days before the Raid on Entebbe in 1976 during which he is killed in the line of duty. In this letter, he pours out his frustrations and doubts about losing his joy for life, he wants to spend more time with her and start to make time for a personal life. At times, we forget our heroes are also human and have their own personal desires.Our countries would not have succeeded without the unselfish acts of outstanding men and women. Please read this book for more insight into the makeup of one exceptional person who put his life on the line for the good of the people and made the ultimate sacrifice."

            "This review can be found at The Armchair Reader.When I started this story, I was expecting to deal with some angst but I wasn\u2019t expecting much of it because of how short the book is. To my surprise, and delight, you\u2019re immediately thrown into the grief and mourning that Kit is experiencing. Losing his best friend and brother, Bear, to a drunk driver hit Kit really hard. He\u2019s no longer the fun, happy kid anymore but instead he\u2019s angry, desolate and feels abandoned by his family and friends. When he receives news about the man that hit Bear, he works up enough courage to finally leave the house and inform his brother\u2019s best friend, Jason. What comes to light from their meeting together is unrequited feelings of love, secrets and intense passion. Kit may think he\u2019s broken but Jason knows he just needs much needed support to get his life back and move on from the pain of his lose.Emotionally and physically scarred characters are probably my favorite things to read about. I love learning about their issues and how they\u2019ve retreated into their shell because of them. In this story, Kit is physically scarred from the same accident that killed Bear and also emotionally damaged from losing his best friend and brother. He\u2019s letting himself lose all aspect of life and retreats into his room without eating or seeing anyone for days at a time. He\u2019s harbored a secret love for his brother\u2019s best friend, Jason, but always thought Jason was straight. Jason has felt the same, however, except he always thought Kit would come to him when he was ready to be educated on sex. Jason doesn\u2019t do relationships, though. He doesn\u2019t like attachments but his desire to help Kit when he realizes how bad Kit is taking everything makes him accept his love for the younger man and act on it.I honestly loved this book. While it deals with grief, it also has sweet moments that made me smile in pure delight because of how gently, but firmly, Jason handles Kit. There\u2019s a bit of BDSM to it for those of you that don\u2019t like this stuff but I loved how everything was handled. Kit isn\u2019t all of a sudden okay with Bear being gone but with Jason\u2019s help he\u2019s coming to accept it. I loved the connection between Kit and Jason because it felt very real to me. Plus, I\u2019ve always had a soft spot for books with \u2018brother\u2019s best friend\u2019 themes to it. Beyond that, I felt like Jason handled Kit rather well. He was straight with Kit about how it would be to have a relationship with Jason and let Kit make up his own mind because Jason lives a BDSM lifestyle and Kit needed to be aware of that. I found it rather hot the sex they had together as well (then again, I enjoy kinky sex more than vanilla sex ,) ). Introducing Kit to Jason\u2019s hidden secret made Kit realize he has a bit of the same desires in himself. The way the BDSM was handled was great, it\u2019s not too intense but it\u2019s not like some other books where it\u2019s very mild to the point you can barely call it BDSM. A perfect mix in healing Kit and touching on the more taboo lifestyle, IMO.My only reservations about the story is that it was a bit too short. I would have liked to see how their relationship progresses and see how Kit is doing as well as what he plans to do with his life now that he\u2019s getting back on track with the living and how Kit\u2019s parents take his relationship with Jason. I also felt like Kit\u2019s family were rather cold. For a family that was so close before the tragic accident, they treated Jason better than they treated Kit. Which I found extremely horrible and hated. I was also confused on the time-frame. I couldn\u2019t figure out exactly when Bear died. I kept thinking during the summer but then thought maybe it happened over winter break? It was never clear to me.Overall, this was a great book. It has enough angst to make you feel but not so much you feel as if it\u2019s cloying and unnecessary. More than that, you feel like the grief is genuine, it\u2019s heartbreaking even though you don\u2019t actually experience the event that causes all these emotions. Kit and Jason talk things out, Kit spills his heart out to Jason and Jason accepts and tries to help Kit in the only way he can, by being there and supporting him. I enjoyed their discovery of each other and their way of healing. I hope there\u2019s more to come of these boys!",
            "Death isn't easy. It isn't meant to be easy. But when you're the one left behind, it can, and often does, shatter your world and everything you've ever trusted and believed in. 'Marked by Grief' is the story of Kit who lost his older brother and best friend, Bear, in a drunk driver accident six months ago. It's also the story of Jason, Bear's best friend, and the man Kit has been in love with for the past six years. This is a story of loss, grief, and finding your way back.Kit isn't dealing with his grief very well. Or at all. Bear was going somewhere with his life, he'd always been the guy everyone loved, he was smart, and funny, and in a single moment, Bear pushed Kit out of the way of the truck that swerved at them and killed Bear. Kit feels as if the wrong brother died and his guilt is eating him up inside. Add this to the fact that the driver was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison, but managed to kill himself before serving time and Kit is at the end of his rope. He goes to Jason's tattoo shop to give him the news about the driver's suicide, and ends up getting a tattoo to honor his brother. It also gives him and Jason a chance to talk and Jason an opportunity to apologize for not being there for Kit these past months.When Jason first sees Kit, he can't believe how much weight Kit has lost since the funeral. Kit is skin and bones and Jason realizes how much him abandoning Kit has hurt him, too. Jason isn't very happy when he discovers that Kit's parents have basically abandoned him also, leaving Kit in his room for days or weeks at a time without checking on him. Jason decides it's up to him to take care of Kit and help him get back to where he needs to be. Jason has a lot of experience being dominant and, luckily for him, it looks as though Kit is a great submissive. But is it all just fun and games, or can there be more? Kit wants more, but Jason has never had long-term.Overall, this was a good story. I had difficulty relating to the characters and I really had trouble seeing them together. Kit is so inexperienced and vulnerable, while Jason most definitely isn't. It was very much a story about a slightly older guy taking charge and, if you like that, then this might be for you.NOTE: This book was provided by Dreamspinner Press for the purpose of a review on Rainbow Book Reviews.",
            "Sometimes getting what you need comes with a price. Kit is still reeling from his brother\u2019s death six months ago. Losing not only his best friend but his brother\u2019s best friend, Jason, as well has left Kit feeling alone and unwanted. When Kit finally forces himself to see Jason, Jason realizes how much pain Kit is in. Although the attraction is clear, Jason has a few rules and tests Kit must pass for them to finally be together. It\u2019s not the relationship Kit ever thought they\u2019d have but the rewards are worth the price.Marked by Grief is a decent enough book. The plot relies heavily on the already established relationship between Kit and Jason to make sense of their lightning fast relationship. They basically get together in the span of hours and after sleeping together the first night, they\u2019re in love and committed for all time. Unfortunately the reader doesn\u2019t get to see any of their friendship or the foundation that this new relationship is undoubtedly based on. Instead all we see is Jason bossing Kit around all day and later on in bed, much to Kit\u2019s initial confusion then acceptance. This isn\u2019t necessarily bad but it keeps the relationship shallow without any of the depth of watching a couple get to know each other and fall in love.Part of this is that the book introduces a BDSM element somewhat offhanded. Jason is supposedly very into bondage and BDSM, thus requiring Kit to be as well. The story goes from nothing to a lot pretty quickly and doesn\u2019t give a lot of context or background. In some places, it\u2019s almost a how-to manual with formal dialogue and instructions. That said, the sex scenes gradually build heat and action in a nice way and there is obvious chemistry between the men. Nothing wrong with the physical in this story.Marked by Grief is a nice read but I didn\u2019t think it was great. It has some emotion with Kit and his brother\u2019s death but leaves a lot of issues unresolved. Jason and Kit make a well-matched couple but I would have liked to seen more. The story seems too rushed to really explore everything \u2013 a new relationship, lingering emotion over Bear\u2019s death, the BDSM angle. It\u2019s a decent story for something quick and easy but not necessarily a memorable one. ",
            "Kit is a broken man after his brother, Bear, dies in a terrible car accident and one that Kit doesn't think he should have survived. Kit slowly starts to fall down a rabbit hole he can't pull himself out of even to save his life.Jason is just as broken up because Bear was his best friend. He decides to throw himself into his work as a tattoo artist. He wants nothing more than to help Kit but thinks that his best friend's brother just needs space despite the warnings that Kit needs help.The story is dark from the beginning and Caitlin Ricci's writing is both haunting and moving throughout the entire book. Ricci's writing pulls you into the pain and doesn't let you go. The grief the two of them feel for the loss of Bear is heartbreaking from page one.But through all of the pain comes the power of love. Kit and Jason work together to start the healing process and learn to live again.This book was well written and very powerful. I highly recommend this book to anyone who loves two sexy men struggling with loss with a sprinkle of kinky sex.",
            "This sucked. I love a good sorta dubconny feeling dark romance so I wasn't put off by the reviews that felt like Jason was taking advantage of kit. But honestly? Jason was way too callous and willing to walk away for me to believe his claimed love for Kit. So fucking what if he doesn't want exactly the kind of kink you do? Give me a break. If you love someone as much as he claimed to, you can make some freaking compromise on your sex life. Sorry not sorry. Jason was an ass. I definitely felt like Kit wanted what was going on more because he didn't want to lose Jason than because he really wanted the D/S lifestlye. Also, kit is NOT a  virgin as I was led to believe from someone's list. ",
            "A good story, but..Engaging characters and a good plot, but there were at least 100 improper usages of the word and at the beginning of sentences. Highlighting them was tedious and time-consuming but it's something I tend to do. Other than that there were only 2 misspellings! I strongly advise the author to edit! I would also have liked to see some kind of resolution of Kit's relationship with his parents. Leaving them looking heartless and neglectful seems wrong considering losing a child is the worst thing that could ever happen to a mother and father. "

            "BATMAN: CRIMSON MIST (4/5)Epilogues are a sad thing. This one is particularly sad. Almost melancholic, in a way. Especially when the last page kicks in, that's when you start philosophing about life and its meaning. Few books can do that. It also depends on the reader of course, but generally few books can do that. Even fewer comic books.So, here is the end. By the way, have you noticed that both Red Rain and Bloodstorm have a feeling of finality in their last pages? As if there never meant to be a next book. But there was. Anyway, this one is the official ending. Irrevocable ending. Hell of a ride though, right? Yeah...and it went out with such a bang. You gotta appreciate that. This is the second sequel and it still has original quality. How many times have you seen that? Not too many times, I bet. The first few pages are probably the best of the entire book. On second thought, make that the entire trilogy. Batman, after being staked in the heart by his friends, is now somewhere between life and death. Immobilized. Call it limbo, hell, purgatory...it does not matter. What does matter is that you realize what this man goes through. He lost the love of his life, shortly after losing his own humanity. Then, after succumbing to his nature only once for killing his nemesis, he is put down like a beast per his own will. Instead of dying however, he is trapped in an eternal torture, cursed with remembering how it felt like to be the most powerfull being on Earth. During his abscense, Gotham city has gone straight to hell. Even worse than when it was in Dracula's grip. After Joker's death, all the low-level freaks from the Penguin to Poison Ivy have come out to play. And they are getting bolder with each crime they commit. That's why Batman's manservant, Alfred Pennyworth, decides to remove the stake of oak from his master's heart and rise him again to fight evil, like good old times. That's when a crimson feast begins with Batman slaughtering every psychopathic criminal in and out of Arkham Asylum. After realizing that Batman is now a stone-cold murderer, Alfred and Comissioner decide to take him down again. For good this time. Permanently. And they accept help from Two-Face's gang and Killer Croc (the only freaks remaining). All right, just to be fair, this alliance, no matter how uneasy it's portrayed to be just doesn't fit right. And I could do without the splatter pages.Published five years after Bloodstorm, this final chapter in Doug Moench's trilogy of the crimefighter turned vampire is absolutely magnificent. Moody. Steady. Philosophical. Action-packed. Moving. What else?Oh, yes. Art. Well, when it comes to that department, this story is artistically inferior to its prequels due to a change of colorist. Les Dorscheid, the last colorist, is not here in this project. I'm not saying the new colorist sucks, but the feeling is different. Unpleasantly different. Also the artwork is less good-looking than it used to be. I later learned that this is because the artist wants to draw a pararell between the decadence of Gotham and Batman's corruption.",
            "Aku spoiler karena SHOCK dengan ending trilogi ini!!!Situation changed, from bad to worse, and worst!Gordon dan Alfred membuat kesalahan, tidak memenggal kepala Batman. Jadi ketika absennya Batman membuat kota Gotham kacau balau dengan merajalelanya para residivis langganan Batman, Alfred membangkitkan kembali tuannya dengan mencabut pasak kayu di jantung Batman.Oke, Batman masih mau untuk membantu Gordon menyingkirkan para penjahat, tapi dengan menjadi apa yang paling tidak diinginkannya semasa hidup: menjadi pembunuh, dan lebih buruk lagi: monster yang lebih berbahaya dari para penjahat yang dimangsanya.Setelah bangkit kembali, Batman kembali memangsa manusia. Selektif sih: Penguin, Riddler, Scarecrow, Poison Ivy, para penjahat, dan akhirnya seluruh penghuni Arkham Asylum... but still... dia jadi pembunuh serial yang jauh lebih gawat dari Dexter (minimal Dexter masih cakep, sementara Bruce Wayne yang ganteng nggak ada lagi).Untuk menghentikan pembantaian yang dilakukan Batman, akhirnya Gordon dan Alfred bekerja sama dengan Two-Face dan Croc. Tapi dasar penjahat, setelah Batman jatuh ke jurang, Two-Face dan Croc memutuskan untuk membunuh Gordon dan Alfred.Tapi Batman masih hidup. Demi menolong Gordon, dan berdasarkan permohonan Alfred, ia memangsa butler kepercayaannya... HIKS...Dan akhirnya setelah Two-Face tewas, Batman mengancam Gordon agar membunuhnya... Gordon pun meledakkan langit-langit gua agar Batman dapat hancur terbakar cahaya matahari, sementara ia sendiri tewas karena tertimpa batu.EVERYBODY DIES...THE END.",

            "Batman: Crimson Mist is an Elseworlds imprint. Written by Doug Moench and penciled by Kelley Jones. It deals with the final act as Batman as a vampire as he is reawakened to save Gotham City once more, but he becomes out of control and it's up to Alfred Pennyworth and Commissioner Gordon to stop him. It is the third part in a trilogy based on old Universal Picture and Hammer Film Production horror films.Gotham is in the grip of a crime wave. Alfred removes the stake from Batman in an attempt to provide Gotham with a savior once again. However, Batman is driven mad by the decay of his body and his longing for blood and begins draining and decapitating all of his old enemies.Two-Face and Killer Croc escape this fate and form an alliance with Gordon and Alfred to kill Batman, as both acknowledge that the man Batman once was would not wish to go on killing his opponents in this manner. Having tracked Batman to his new lair in the Batcave, Alfred lures him into the main part of the cavern, and they trigger explosives to expose Batman to the sun.All in all, Batman: Crimson Mist is written and constructed somewhat well and it was rather effective and successful in mixing the worlds of Batman and old Universal Picture and Hammer Film Production horror films rather well."

            "Alfred resurrects Batman from the dead after the events of Crimson Mist. Batman becomes full on evil vampire and straight up murders his entire rogues gallery. This should be great. There are people's heads getting ripped off and strung together on a rope by Batman. But Moench adds to much Dark Shadows type melodrama and Kelley Jones art is so off-putting. Batman has about 30 ribs in his chest. These storytellers are awful. It's hard to believe they were the main Batman creative team for several years.",
            "The Batman Vampire trilogy comes to a close! So the story has all of Batman's villains bust out of Arkham and in desperation, Alfred decides to bring Batman back to stop them and he then goes on a killing spree! This series was definitely one of the Elseworld books I enjoyed a lot, so what did I think of this third entry? The story and writing were good enough, as it's a bittersweet ending to the series. It was oddly satisfying to see a Batman who just doesn't waste time and just kills all of his villains left, right and centre. The artwork is a mixed bag in this series as I enjoy how Batman himself is drawn, in his monstrous Vampire form, but other characters like Alfred are drawn very weirdly and are not my cup of coffee. Overall though I enjoyed this final entry as I have this whole series!",
            "Wow. That's pretty much all I thought after the final panel of Crimson Mist. This is the darkest Batman of all, the one that honors his name and becomes a predator of criminals and innocents alike. We start Crimson Mist with the agony of Batman, condemned to exist in Limbo and to thirst for blood for all eternity. At the same time, we see that Gotham has fallen victim to the Penguin, Two Face, Killer Croc, The Riddler, Poison Ivy, and many more, and that Alfred and Gordon are doubting their decision to kill Batman. In a moment of desperation, Alfred removes the stake that is immobilizing his master and releases an evil worse than the one that is already corrupting Gotham, for the Batman that is loose is no longer the protector of the city, but its biggest threat. I can only end this review by saying that this was a fantastic trilogy, worthy of Dracula and Batman. The art has been consistent and scary, the story is solid, and it was great to read it so close to halloween. I can't wait to give it to my brother.",
            "Some people ask why Batman bothers apprehending super criminals and turning them back over to the police or Arkham Asylum. After all, the likes of The Joker, Two-Face, Poison Ivy, and the other rogues in Batman's rogue's gallery are going to break out and rape, pillage, and plunder again. Maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow, maybe not a year from now. But it's inevitable, and people are going to suffer because at their hands. It would be better, people, for Batman to kill them. Wouldn't it be nice to see the Bat-signal in the sky and know that whatever evil he's being summoned to clean up, The Joker was not, could not be behind it?And Batman would agree with them: Yes, that would be nice. But he will not kill even though The Joker in particular has taken more of his extended family from him than any other villain. He refuses to kill not for any religious reason or out of moral smugness, but because he knows, deep down, that he is mad, and if he kills one villain, he will kill all of them, and no mortal\u2014and very few superpowered beings\u2014could stand against him.BATMAN: CRIMSON MIST is the third and final installment of the Batman: Vampire series. Gotham's super criminals are figuratively burning the city to the ground, so one of Batman's allies does what he thinks is the right thing and removes the stake from vampire-Batman's heart, bringing him back to un-life. Batman awakens believing he is easy because he drank The Joker's blood, and now that blood is coursing through his veins\u2026 kind of? Does blood course through a vampire's veins? I thought they were just, you know, super-duper thirsty for it? Anyway.CRIMSON MIST is satisfying on two levels. The first is purely animal. If you've ever wanted to see Batman go on a tear and murder every villain who's so much as looked at him the wrong way, this is the book for you. Batman was right: No one can stand against him, especially because now, he has the powers of the vampire at his command.The second level is psychological. Batman is one of the strongest, most intelligent heroes ever written. That's what makes him so compelling. He can break bones with the best of them, but he's also known as the World's Greatest Detective because his mind is as strong as his body. However, this comes with a powerful caveat: Batman is insane. He'd have to be. What man who witnessed his parents gunned down in front of him at the age of eight, who dedicated his life to avenging them by shunning any emotional ties and pouring his fortune into training his mind and body, and who interpreted a bat smashing through his window that he should dress up as a bat and stalk criminals, could be sane?It's not a rhetorical question. Even the most intelligent people have flaws. Batman has many, but one of them is being a sucker for superstition. Case in point: Is Batman truly evil in CRIMSON MIST because The Joker's blood, which he believes to have been corrupted by the most potent type of evil, was the first he drank after becoming a vampire? Or is he just saying that, using it as an excuse to let himself go unhinged and kill every villain who has ever terrorized Gotham?The final pages of CRIMSON MIST made me ask myself if the ends justified the means. There is no easy answer."

            "Wow. I really milked this one out. Three months, that's insane! But it wasn't because I didn't like it, more that I savored it in small bedtime size portions.If you're at all remotely interested in the Raj or India in general at the turn of the century, you must read this. M.M.Kaye lived a fascinating life and was able to see and experience things before the march of progress  changed everything, and thankfully she possessed a photographic memory and could then share her lifetime of adventures with us.A few things that really stood out from this book:Her father. He really sounded like a character! Astoundingly, he spoke 11 languages and 18 dialects! Incredible!Her childhood. How many children have played in abandoned palaces, watched Tibetan villagers come across the Himalayan pass peddling their goods, or swiped tea trays on board ship during a horrendous storm (in which several other ships sank) to go 'sledding ' down the deck when the ship tipped? True life is far stranger than fiction!It wasn't all fun and laughs though. Children of the Raj knew that eventually they'd go home  to England for schooling. (Even though the only home they knew was India and their parents would stay behind). However, WW1 was a grace for the author as it delayed the inevitable for a few years, but her brother was sent to England at age 6 (just before the war) and it was 6 years before either parent saw him again. Heartbreakingly, he did not recognize or remember any of them.I loved this book so why 4 stars and not 5? Well, the bits in England did drag a bit. The author didn't quite know what to leave out so told us everything down to which song was playing when, and what picture show they went to. Probably very interesting to pop culture fans, just not me. CONTENT:SEX: NoneVIOLENCE : None per se but a few unpleasant (yet fascinating) details about the Spanish Flu that hit India particularly hard. Apparently so many died the population couldn't afford the wood for cremation so started dumping the bodies in the rivers where they collected like decomposing dams until even the crocodile were to satiated to move.PROFANITY :Mild to nonePARANORMAL ELEMENTS : Two passages about haunted houses. One in India (pretty frightening) and one in England. I chose to remove these from my book.MY RATING : PG",
            "Bestselling novelist Kaye (The Far Pavilions) was the daughter of a kindly, ciphering expert father and a party-loving, vivacious young mother who were posted to the Raj, where she was born in 1908. The family sojourned alternately in Simla and Delhi, and Kaye gives vivid descriptions of the beautiful hill country where the family rented a series of houses. At age six her older brother was left behind in England with relatives to start the necessary schooling, it would be seven years before his mother next saw him. There were no such requirements for girls, and Kaye and her younger sister Bets's education consisted mostly of history and poetry readings from their beloved father, and running around Simla with their Anglo and Indian chums, supervised either by an ayah, or not at all. When the Great War ended, there was no reason for mother and daughters to remain in India, and as soon as a ship's berth was available they sailed for England. The realization that this meant boarding school and lots of gray skies and rain was a grim one. Kaye never cottoned to classroom learning and confesses that even as an adult she could never do sums. The only thing she was good at was drawing. The memoir ends in the 1920s, when she is around 18 or 19, having turned down a chance to go to the Slade school because she has no interest in being a serious artist. Her assumption is that she will marry and live on her husband's money.One memorable scene of India is the sisters' sadistic British nanny, who would force large amounts of castor oil on Kaye, setting her bowels in motion while out on the town, she tries to run home to the loo but ends up shitting herself before arriving there. The nanny is sent packing, but the diet of castor oil caused gastrointestinal problems for the rest of her life. Another scene is the girls' many trips to the Taj Mahal, where they would have the run of the entire mausoleum and grounds because it hadn't yet become a huge tourist destination.Kaye specifies that this will not be a political memoir, and she hews to that except for the passages where she extols colonialism, more than a little tone-deafly. While insisting that her parents had not a racist bone in their bodies, which could very well be true, she seems not to understand that a deep love for a country and its people, at the individual and personal level, never precludes systemic racism and de facto servitude. She ridicules Forster's A Passage to India as a virulent attack on his own race which came to be regarded as Holy Writ by the trendy. If only people would look at old photographs or talk to left-overs from the Raj they would realize how mistaken the anti-colonial stance is. Her biggest complaint about the British empire is what it does to British families, separating mothers from children and fathers from all of them.",
            "There are books I read where I look back and have a hard time remembering who wrote it...what was that author's name? And then there are other books where I may not remember the story but feel like it introduced me to an amazing person, someone I wish I could meet. This book left me loving Mary Margaret Kaye. The details may be fuzzy in the future, but I will never forget this lovely lady and her storytelling genius. I initially was introduced to her writing in The Ordinary Princess, which spurred me to look for more. And this autobiography in which she paints with vivid colors her childhood in India certainly did not disappoint. Mary Margaret writes superbly, with an eye for the important and poignant detail and a gentle, self-deprecating humor. She describes beauty with poetic grace and then captures the humor of the humblest of life's moments. She left me loving what she loves and hating what she hates (really there isn't much that M.M. Kaye hates, though). I think her goal in writing The Sun in the Morning was to beguile the reader into a full-fledged love of India and she certainly succeeded with me. I hate flying in airplanes, but I'd almost be willing to get on one to go see the Taj Mahal, simply based on her description of it. This is a book that unfolds slowly and it took a bit for me to get into it, but once settled into the story, I loved every page and was sad to see it end. I really want to know what happened with the rest of M.M. Kaye's life...so on to her next autobiographical volumes! ",
            "Oh how I would have loved to be M.M. Kaye's companion during her childhhod years. Her love for India pours from every page and even lasted through the dull years in England, which was never home to her. If you liked The Far Pavilions, you will also fall in in love with this book. You can smell, see and feel the India of the Raj through the eyes and the clever writing hand of a woman who truely loved that country.",

            "Let's be honest the writing for the first issues of Wonder Woman could be tweaked and fixed quite a bit. However, she is most iconic female superhero. Reading her first few issues isn't just for fans of Wonder Woman, but it's a look at comic book history in the making.Her stories were ahead of her time. It's laughable to think that the modern day stories of Wonder Woman have no value as they did back in her day. Not sure what happened, but DC literally took out any sign that Wonder Woman had some smart writing.With Marston writing the comics it went into politics and very heavy feminism topics. He was was also a psychologist and you can see that with various things, one being her magic lasso. The feminism really stands out though. Unlike the women at the time, she was fighting on the battle field. Yes her alter ego was a nurse, but she was fighting Nazis as Wonder Woman. In this volume too you see her face several other things that represents what it means to be a feminist. There are also early hits cross dressing in comics. About three of her villains are cross-dressers and it's not used in the comedic sense like the cartoons at the time.So what happened to the writing of Wonder Woman? The only writers who I thought did a good job with her were in the 80s, the late 00s, and a little bit of the first few issues of her New 52 run. Other then that it seems like most of the writers focus on her outfit or they just don't get her character at all. They leave out any trace that her character was in fact a feminist. With all these strong female leads in comics you'd think we'd bring up actual issues again.Five stars because this is were it all began and how involved she was originally. Three or four stars because yes it can get cheesy and erotic at times when it's not necessary.",

            "Let's be perfectly honest: the only reason to read these old Wonder Woman stories is historical curiosity. Or at least the only reason for me: although I love the Golden Age heroes, the Golden Age stories usually fall flat for me, and probably for many modern readers. In many ways, Wonder Woman is a reverse of the stereotypical Superman format: here, it's the woman who's strong, smart, and capable, and the man who needs to be rescued. That was, of course, the point. Marston's creation was pretty feminist for his day, and it's an idea that we still don't see enough of: the woman who has physical strength and power and is attractive in part because of that strength. These are the good things to take from early Wonder Woman, the character herself. ",
            "This was a very interesting read, from a historical perspective. Published in the early 1940s, Wonder Woman's first stories are groundbreaking with the first major super heroine. However, the stories are also indicative of attitudes of the era with a bit of misogyny and some very racist caricatures of all the non-white characters. Keeping the historical context in mind, it was good to read the quirky origins of this iconic super hero, even though the storytelling style was a bit of a slog for me at times. ",
            "When I was a little girl I watched reruns of the Wonder Woman TV show and I loved them, and I've always had a love for Wonder Woman ever since, but I never knew the origins.This was the first time I read any Wonder Woman comics, so I went back to the beginning. I loved the first line - At last, in a world torn by the hatreds and wars of men, appears a woman to whom the problems and feats of men are mere child's play.These were published in the early 1940s, and reading it now it feels understandably dated, so I couldn't help but laugh, especially at the magic girdle.Yes, there is a MAGIC GIRDLE, given to Wonder Woman's mother by Aphrodite. I have a hard time believing that the goddess of love thinks girdles are all that lovely.So I'm very glad I read the origins and it was entertaining, but I don't think I'll keep reading all the volumes. It's just too dated for me, but I'm glad I now know where Wonder Woman came from.",
            "Not my favorite, but well worth the read. It was really interesting to see how the character of Wonder Woman started out in the 1940's. It all seems rather daring and I wonder how it went over at the time. I would like to know more about who the comics were aimed at and who the actually read them. ",
            "Enjoyed these, although the plots were similar in most of the stories. It's interesting to look back at these old stories and see how different things were back then, particularly the outright racist artwork.One thing that stands out is how often Wonder Woman and other female characters wound up in bondage. I think it probably had to do with the moral panics about white slavery at the time, as well as the author's personal proclivities. I understand the movie Professor Marston and the Wonder Women, which I have not seen, deals with that."

When their field armies blundered into contact on the evening of 22 October 1642, Prince Rupert urged King Charles to array his army on the great ridge of Edgehill and give battle.

Between Hisoka popping into his prison and the wormholes opening, Kurikara may at last have a chance at getting the revenge he craves. Back in the village protected by the Kurosaki estate, Tatsumi and Watari uncover more mysteries involving Hisoka\u2019s family, a family everyone in the region hails as heroes. Long ago, a Kurosaki samurai defeated a horned snake god, whom the village was forced to sacrifice their own flesh and blood to. There may be a more sinister truth behind the legend with a villain at the center of it all as perverse as Muraki\u2026Many mysteries and unanswered questions were raised by this volume.

What did rap music and hip hop culture inherit from the Black Women's Club Movement, New Negro Movement, Harlem Renaissance, Hipster Movement, and Black Muslim Movement? How did black popular music and black popular culture between 1900 and the 1950s influence white youth culture, especially the Lost Generation and the Beat Generation, in ways that mirror rap music and hip hop culture's influence on contemporary white youth music, culture, and politics? In Hip Hop's Amnesia award-winning author, spoken-word artist, and multi-instrumentalist Reiland Rabaka answers these questions by rescuing and reclaiming the often-overlooked early twentieth century origins and evolution of rap music and hip hop culture. Hip Hop's Amnesia is a study about aesthetics and politics, music and social movements, as well as the ways in which African Americans' unique history and culture has consistently led them to create musics that have served as the soundtracks for their socio-political aspirations and frustrations, their socio-political organizations and nationally-networked movements. The musics of the major African American social and political movements of the 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s were based and ultimately built on earlier forms of \"African American movement music.\" Therefore, in order to really and truly understand rap music and hip hop culture we must critically examine both classical African American musics and the classical African American movements that these musics served as soundtracks for. This book is primarily preoccupied with the ways in which post-enslavement black popular music and black popular culture frequently served as a soundtrack for and reflected the grassroots politics of post-enslavement African American social and political movements. Where many Hip Hop Studies scholars have made clever allusions to the ways that rap music and hip hop culture are connected to and seem to innovatively evolve earlier forms of black popular music and black popular culture, Hip Hop's Amnesia moves beyond anecdotes and witty allusions and earnestly endeavors a full-fledged critical examination and archive-informed re-evaluation of \"hip hop's inheritance\" from the major African American musics and movements of the first half of the twentieth century: classic blues, ragtime, classic jazz, swing, bebop, the Black Women's Club Movement, the New Negro Movement, the Harlem Renaissance, the Bebop Movement, the Hipster Movement, and the Black Muslim Movement.",

        "desc": "Line in the Sand, details the dramatic transformation of the western U.S.-Mexico border from its creation at the end of the Mexican-American War in 1848 to the emergence of the modern boundary line in the first decades of the twentieth century. In this sweeping narrative, Rachel St. John explores how this boundary changed from a mere line on a map to a clearly marked and heavily regulated divide between the United States and Mexico. Focusing on the desert border to the west of the Rio Grande, this book explains the origins of the modern border and places the line at the center of a transnational history of expanding capitalism and state power in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries., Moving across local, regional, and national scales, St. John shows how government officials, Native American raiders, ranchers, railroad builders, miners, investors, immigrants, and smugglers contributed to the rise of state power on the border and developed strategies to navigate the increasingly regulated landscape. Over the border's history, the U.S. and Mexican states gradually developed an expanding array of official laws, ad hoc arrangements, government agents, and physical barriers that did not close the line, but made it a flexible barrier that restricted the movement of some people, goods, and animals without impeding others. By the 1930s, their efforts had created the foundations of the modern border control apparatus., Drawing on extensive research in U.S. and Mexican archives, ,Line in the Sand, weaves together a transnational history of how an undistinguished strip of land became the significant and symbolic space of state power and national definition that we know today.",

            "A Harvard professor, Rachel St. John, has just published a useful and comprehensive short history of the western U.S.-Mexico border (meaning from El Paso to San Diego.)It is a tale that approaches geography as a multiform kind of space: social space, indigenous space, national identity space, commercial space, smuggling space, and so forth.Early on, as history records, the United States found ways to take what we call the northern portion of the U.S.-Mexico border from Mexico by purchase, diplomacy, and political supremacy based on population. Thereafter, both Mexico and the U.S. found the new border between our two countries hard to define as a literal line in the sand and even more difficult to define as an emblem of state power: my law is the only law on this side...your law is the only law on that side.Having worked and lived on the border for a number of years, I know what a rough, ambiguous and violent place it can be. There are things I have seen in the canyons north of Tijuana, right at the U.S. border, that have no place in what 99.9% of Americans would think to be American. Subsequent wallbuilding has quieted some of the action, but there is an ethical ugliness to the way we have approached migration and smuggling that is harsh and constant. One doesn\u2019t have to know what to do to change things, although I have a few notions, to recognize that there is something wrong all along the border, and not just the western border.Better books to reveal the harsh realities of the border\u2019s past and present are novels like Cormac MacCarthy\u2019s Blood Meridian and Roberto Bola\u00f1os\u2019 2666. Both excel in depicting mindless violence, generally driven by greed but going beyond that. So reading Blood Meridian and 2666 is one prescription I\u2019d offer for a national elevation of consciousness about the border. We in the U.S. need to face the fact that our insatiable appetite for drugs, cocaine, etc., is what fuels the astonishing violence and corruption that travels from our border all the way to Bolivia. The only way to change this is through the earliest kinds of childhood intervention and family support programs. Bad neighborhoods, broken families, and bad schools breed drug use. Good neighborhoods, ostensibly united families, and good schools breed drug use, too. Every family in American with young children needs help facing the torments and temptations of illicit drugs. Until we slow down consumption, we won\u2019t slow down the killing on our own streets and further south.Illegal immigration is another important issue that breeds great misery both north and south of the border. Right now we\u2019re in an ebb tide because jobs are scarce in the U.S. construction industry and enforcement is up, but that will change. Right now, then, would be a good time to face the fact that it would be better for Mexicans (and others) to enter the U.S. under organized worker programs--we\u2019ve had them before--than to play cat and mouse with desperate souls in the deathly deserts of the southwest. Walls can\u2019t be built high enough when the jobs are here to feed families. As Janet Napolitano said once, \u201cShow me a fifty foot wall and I\u2019ll show you a fifty-one foot ladder.\u201d By the same token, I have seen massive walls on the border smashed through by even more massive bulldozers. Brazen? You bet. The border is a life and death proposition for hundreds of thousands, even millions, of people.But again, my practical thoughts aside, I point to the value of fiction versus history in exploring certain complex events and regions. The St. John book is informative, but not moving. The Bola\u00f1os and MacCarthy novels are riveting revelations and summons to action.",
            "An excellent overview of how the US-Mexico border emerged from the deserts of northern Mexico and the Southwest US and became a point of national focus in forming both the US and Mexican states. Touching on geography, economics, immigration, and the daily lives of those living in the border region, this book offers a starting place for understanding how a theoretical line in the sand morphed and gave birth to the heated debates over The Wall today. ",
            "This is a history of the part of the US - Mexican border west of the Rio Grande river from its initial specification and ratification by treaty after the Mexican war and the Gadsen Purchase up until the 1930s. The book presents an evolving view of the border world from the wild west to the Guilded Age to Prohibition to the Depression. Theer are interesting points and the book is well written (it is clearly a dissertation that has been worked up into a book). Not a lot that is surprising but lots of good stuff to know and consistent with what was happening in the US and the world overall during the period. I suspect the author should be sending residuals to Trump for the nenewed interest in the border and immigration, but as the author shows, there have been ugly politics around the border for a very long time.",

            "Ancient Egypt continues to hold great appeal for young and old, and even makes the best-seller lists (see Stacy Schiff's Cleopatra: A Life, for example). Award-winning author Donna Jo Napoli's newest book, suitable for elementary school readers, is set during that fascinating period, and tells the story of Kepi, a young girl living around 2530 BCE. Kepi's father, a laborer, has been wounded during the construction of a pyramid for Pharaoh Khufu. Kepi's life changes dramatically when she, along with her pet baby baboon, Babu, is kidnapped and hidden in a large basket on a boat. Where is she being taken and what will become of them? Babu, we soon discover, is destined to be sold to priests at one of the great city temples. When she is separated from her beloved pet, Kepi decides she must go see the powerful Pharaoh to tell him about men who are getting injured building his pyramid. Surely he will help these men and their families! Kepi will need to draw on all her courage to try to reach the all-powerful Pharaoh. Napoli makes the reader feel that she, too, is travelling down the Nile, with her vivid descriptions of the wildlife--oryx, pelicans, and the dangerous hippos, crocodiles, and other animals--temples, gods, and people of the region. This is a quick-moving adventure story well-suited for middle-grade readers. Here in California, ancient Egypt part of the sixth grade curriculum, and this would be an excellent book to recommend for children developing an interest in that period. Many of the novels about this period for young people seem to involve Cleopatra, this new book makes a welcome addition to novels about the period, offering a story about an ordinary girl who takes an extraordinary journey. One note: the publisher's copy for this novel indicates that the story revisits the fabled origin of fairies. The end of the book does contain a fairy element (I won't go into the details here) but I would say that the fairy story is secondary in this novel to the historical fiction side. I would not want to pitch this to children as a story about fairies, since fairies do not even come into the narrative into the very end. A child expecting Disney Fairies goes to ancient Egypt will be very disappointed!",
            "Kepi's name means tempest. She does everything passionately and with the best intentions from rescuing Babu, the baby baboon to her journey up the river on a mission to help Babu and speak to the pharaoh on behalf of her father wounded working on the pyramids. At first her only friends are animals, but then it begins to seem that her prayers are being answered just not necessarily as she expected. She will make friends but this journey will end far from how she expected.About the cover: Kepi looks very clean and very well dressed. That is not the simple dress that she wears on this great adventure and seeing as her mother takes away her jewelry the headpiece seems out of place... and she is just so clean. When I first saw the cover I was thinking she was a rich Egyptian, not a farm girl who goes through such hardship. I enjoyed it. I liked that I did not have the slightest clue how it was going to end. I think it was a good balance of new vocabulary and familiar vocabulary. Kepi is extremely likeable but far from perfect. The ending threw me for a loop, but I think it was a good one. It feels very mini-epic in some ways. You can imagine it as a more story book version: less character but which major events would stick out. However I think Kepi definitely made the story, even the others we don't get to know as well. Definitely enjoyed, definitely one where I was more conscious of the younger audience.Source: ARC from ALA 2011",
            "It\u2019s probable that Donna Jo Napoli\u2019s books first sparked my interest in historical fiction with \u201cBeast\u201d being the most memorable. I am always confident when picking up a book from this author that the material is well researched \u2013 yet still suspenseful and not bogged down by someone trying too hard to prove they are knowledgeable on the subject. It\u2019s interesting as I haven\u2019t read a book by her (or anyone) since before I had my daughter, who is now almost 18 months. My perspective and the characters I\u2019m drawn towards is somewhat different, and it really surprised me. Kepi, an Egyptian peasant girl, finds herself in the care of a baby baboon and when two boys steal \u201cBabu\u201d away, she gives chase and finds herself as a captive as well. I appreciate that this girl is NOT a damsel-in-distress, but a young woman determined to do what\u2019s necessary to save her baboon, and her family from ruin brought on by ruthless pharaoh. She has big aspirations and doesn\u2019t let anyone\u2019s doubt interfere with her own ambition. This is the type of story I want my daughter to read and know that you need to be a master of your own destiny (though help along the way from some Egyptian Gods and Goddesses doesn\u2019t hurt)! Ultimately, I\u2019m sure some readers may be able to predict the ending \u2013 I couldn\u2019t. I enjoyed it the book, but honestly I may have preferred an alternate ending. ",
            "gr 4-8 267 pgsaround 2530 BC, Ancient Egypt. Her family is always warning Kepi to think before she acts, but Kepi just can't help herself. Because of her impulsiveness, Kepi ends up being kidnapped. At first, Kepi is desperate to return home. But then Kepi decides that once they reach Ineb Hedj, the capital, she might have an opportunity to do some good. Her father is unable to work since he was injured while helping to build the pharaoh's pyramid. Kepi is sure that if she can just talk to the pharaoh, she'll be able to convince him to provide financial help to her and her family, and others like them.This was a great historical fiction story up until the last few pages when the Egyptian gods showed up and turned Kepi and her friends into fairies. In the author's note at the end of the book, the author explains that she intended this story to be about how fairies came to be. Although there were hints that the Egyptian gods might be taking an interest in Kepi, it was hard to tell if these events were not just coincidences. I would've liked this book more if it had skipped the fairies or gave the Egyptian gods a larger part earlier in the book. I would recommend this book to readers who like adventure stories."

            "According to me, this is one of the underrated gems of Agatha Christie, where she flirts with fantasy. Even though none of the stories except the last one (Harlequin's Lane) cross over into fantasy territory, they are always on the borderline. That Christie does this without straining our credibility speaks volumes for her mastery of the medium.Mr. Harley Quin is a thinly disguised Harlequin, transported into modern England. His specialty: he allows one to solve mysteries by stripping away the unnecessary details. He does this by asking one to imagine that the events happened in the remote past, to strangers: this removes the personal element from the equation and allows one to see clearer. Mr. Satterthwaite, an elderly bachelor who is interested in human beings and their affairs, is the usual beneficiary of Quin's method.Most of the mysteries in the volume are dark and brooding. The first story, The Coming of Mr. Quin, sets the tone for the whole book when Quin appears at the doorstep of the country house where Mr. Satterthwaite happens to be spending his New Year's Eve, as the first visitor of the year. As he steps across the threshold, a queer trick of the light appears to give the impression that the visitor is dressed in motley and is wearing a mask. Then Quin sets out to make his presence felt by enabling the house-guests to solve the mystery of a suicide that happened in that house a year ago! In the process, he helps two lovers reunite.This is Quin's trademark - love...and violent death. As Satterthwaite says, his friend seem to be interested in the welfare of lovers more than solving crimes. But in a Christie story, they often go hand in hand.This book is a personal favourite of mine, read over and over countless number of times, especially on wet June nights, in the cavernous rooms of my ancestral home in Kerala, as the monsoon rages outside. I half expect Quin to step over the threshold every time, saying: Damnable weather outside. Can I wait inside till it clears?",
            "This is an anthology of 12 short stories featuring Mr. Harley Quin and his sidekick Mr. Satterthwaite. I would call it a full anthology except that for some mysterious (bad pun totally intended) reason it does not include two last stories of Mr. Quin. This time I would not talk about each story separately as it seems rather pointless - they have same-y feels, but in a good sense. In any way Mr. Satterthwaite has great knowledge of human nature and psychology. He can always be found in company of famous people observing the drama happening between them. Sometimes the drama becomes a crime. Mr. Satterthwaite does not pretend to be a sleuth, but in such cases Mr. Quin makes a dramatic appearance and gives just (barely) enough clues to Mr. Satterthwaite for the latter to untangle the mystery. He himself never even solves one. Sometimes he does even shows himself to anybody but his friend - if such a mysterious guy (entity? god? incarnation? death itself?) can have one.As one can see the stores are mysteries with some supernatural elements - but fear not, the solution always lays in pure material plane. Anything outside of Mr. Quin himself could be found in normal life of twentieth century. I already mentioned two missing stories: The Harlequin Tea Set and The Love Detectives. They can be found in another anthology Problem at Pollensa Bay and Other Stories. In fact this is probably the only place where the second one can be found. They are not outstanding in any sense, but even minor efforts of Agatha Christie are worth reading. There are exceptions though - I am looking at you, Passenger to Frankfurt.While I like the idea of Mr. Quin himself, Mr. Satterthwaite as a character is nothing to write home about. This is totally intentional as even he himself prides in being a simple observer all the time except when his meddling is called for - or he is forced to act by gentle pushing by Mr. Quin, to be exact. This makes him very unremarkable character, he is neither Hercule Poirot nor Miss Marple. Tommy, Tuppence and Mrs. Oliver can also beat him with their arms tied behind their backs. Add to this the fact that the mysteries themselves were decent, but none of them was on the level of Murder on the Orient Express or And Then There Were None and my rating of 3 stars would not come as a surprise. ",
            "An Agatha Christie novel starring Harley Quinn?!No. Calm down, nerd.But it does feature a character named Harley Quin, who helps our main character, Mr. Satterthwaite, solve a series of old mysteries that somehow relate to whatever situation our elderly hero finds himself in at the moment. &lt,--at a house party, trip abroad, etc.But in case you're thinking whothefuckcares if the name isn't Poirot or Marple, there's a paranormal TWIST to this one that I've never seen before in any of Christie's writing that makes this a worthwhile read for any fan.Ok, and since I can't be the only person who didn't really know what the hell a harlequin was:har\u00b7le\u00b7quin/\u02c8h\u00e4rl\u0259kw\u0259n/noun1.a mute character in traditional pantomime, typically masked and dressed in a diamond-patterned costume.Similar: jester, joker, merry andrew, droll, zanySo...like some sort of an even weirder mime or something?Anyway, if nothing else, I now have one more useless piece of information floating around in my head. And maybe, so do you!In all seriousness, if you're looking for something kind of different in an Agatha Christie story, then this just might fit the bill.",

            "4.5 Sentiment beloonged to his age. It had no part to play in the modern world.This is a Christie that is totally different from the one you and I know, or knew, or thought we knew. Even in her most-known and appreciated works, she always flirts with the supernatural and the mysterious, but, this time around, flirting isn't enough for her anymore: this time, she abandons herself to it, and yet without giving the impression of fully doing it. It's a mystery in itself, how she did it, the main and the most dense of the whole collection. Not once does the reader feel mocked or wronged because of the peculiar air the arcane presence of Mr. Harley Quin bestows on these stories, which is, to me, another marvellous paradox, being they crime stories -and Christie's at that. Agatha Christie, mother of the rational, precise, objective, infallible Hercule Poirot, and now she gives birth to this ghost, this wraith, this shadow of a man who appears, magically, whenever and wherever a new tragedy is about to happen or an old one needs to be put to sleep. I would have dismissed without a second thought any crime novel presenting such a premise, and I would have wronged myself terribly. I already knew I would find it brilliant (it's Christie we're talking about, after all), but I wasn't prepared to love its peculiarity and strangeness to the point of not being able to think of anything or little else for days afterwards. Mr. Quin is unjustly underestimated, if you ask me. I, for once, have found him to be extremely more remarkable and intriguing that the infamous Miss Marple ever was -but, banally, not as much as my Poirot is.Not all of the stories of this collection are exceptional, but almost. One or two may result unusually lame (by Chritie's standard, which is to say good nonetheless), but I can promise the others won't disappoint. If Agatha were still alive, I would start a petition to have more Quin's stories. Twelve are far too few."

            "Today's post is on Otomen volume 15 by Aya Kanno. It is the fifteenth in her Otomen series. It is 192 pages long and is publishes by Shojo Beat. As this is the fifteenth volume in this series, you need to have read the first fourteen volumes to understand the story. The cover is yellow with a group Asuka's friends and his father on it. The intended reader is someone who likes shojo manga, humor, and love stories. There is no foul language, no sex, and no violence in this manga. The story is told from third person close of the main character with moments of the other characters added in for plot development. There Be Spoilers Ahead.Review- Asuka's kendo rival Hajime Tonomine feels torn when his father declares him as his future successor. Will Tonomine give up his love of makeup in order to enter the world of politics? Or will his otomen pastime find a way to prevail?Review- The first story is about Tonomine finally being honest with himself and his family. His family knows but unless he was willing to honest with them about what he wanted they expected him to follow in his father's footsteps. Of course in the end he chooses himself and the future that will make him the happiest. The last story is about Yamato and his desire to not be himself. He does not have a very good self opinion and he gets some work on that in this volume. But it ends with he realizing that he has a crush on Ryo and decides to go for it. So with only three volumes left I'm not sure what Kanno can do with that added story line but I will find out soon!I give this volume Five out of Five stars. I get nothing for my review and I bought this manga with my own money. ",

It also had a nice twist with Ryo that made me grin. Most of all, I was glad to see how things worked out between Tonomine and his father. I was so afraid that part would be over the top as well, but when it comes to emotions Aya Kanno manages to keep things down to earth. It's nice.The twist at the end of the volume made me groan, though. I don't want a love triangle, even if part of it is one-sided, and if it gets too painful, I'm going to take a break from this series. We'll see.",

            "~4-4.5/5Contains some spoilers.So, I don\u2019t really know what happened, given how before I was just enjoying the series, but now I\u2019m kind of in love with it. It\u2019s just\u2026 this volume was so good. It just was. And I loved it. And I really want the next one now.The first half of the volume focuses on Tonomine, who I like, but am not a huge fan of. Still, the story was entertaining. I feel for Tonomine, I\u2019m glad for how his story turned out. He\u2019s being pressured by his dad to go into politics, while he wants very badly to be a makeup artist, and his sister knows this. There\u2019s also a bridal show, which includes Asuka and Ryo and is just kind of cute. And even while it was being super cheesy, I was, for some reason, grinning. It was just so enjoyable, I don\u2019t know why.One of my problems with this series, I think, is that there\u2019s so much drama and anguish over something, like how Tonomine\u2019s father will react, and then it just turns out like roses and butterflies at the end. The conclusions are just too sweet, and sometimes the setups are too convenient. This bothers me, but I try not to let it, because I still really enjoy this series.After Tonomine, the story shifts to focus on Yamato. Yamato is just an okay character, really, but I really enjoyed his storyline here. He has a hard time with the fact that he looks girly, because he wants to be so manly and tough. And then a guy who he used to go to school with, who bullied him, shows up and Yamato tells him that Ryo is his girlfriend. He doesn\u2019t tell anyone else this, Ryo has no idea, and yet his charade goes on. And turns out rather well for him in the end, as he learns to embrace his girly looks, in a rather awesome, hilarious way. This whole half of the volume had me grinning and laughing, honestly, and I\u2019m not even sure why. It was just so good.The best part about this whole volume, though, was Ryo. I just love her. I don\u2019t even know how to express my utter love for her, but she is simply amazing, and I love her. She\u2019s so simple minded, and tough, and oblivious. And she\u2019s so open, and happy to try anything. She\u2019s not a good cook, but she tries anyway, she\u2019s a girl and it\u2019s unconventional, but she\u2019ll happily fight with anyone. I mean, Yamato and his old bully are fighting it out at carnival games, trying to prove who is tougher, and she is beating all of their asses at everything, without even realizing what this means to them. And then, when she realizes Yamato is having a hard time with his self-confidence, she spouts off, twice, with very helpful advice, without even realizing how helpful she is being to him. I just love her, and I want more of her. I want her to get more focus in later volumes, I want her to get all the focus, really, because I want her, all the time. More of her. Please?Anyway, on the romance front.  So, Yamato comes to realize that he\u2019s kind of falling for Ryo, and want this to stop, but of course, when he goes to Juta, he spouts off about how \u201cLove is a Battle\u201d, which gets Yamato all worked up. This is surely not going to be good for Ryo and Asuka, but good writing material for Juta, and all around funny in the next volume.On the other hand, I really enjoy Ryo and Asuka\u2019s relationship. There is very little actual romance between them that is shown, they\u2019re barely ever holding hands or kissing or even going out on dates but once in a blue moon. But it\u2019s so obvious how they feel about each other. I mean, they\u2019re always thinking about each other, they kind of light up when they\u2019re around each other. Asuka would love to do love-dovey things with Ryo, while she is oblivious to it all, and he\u2019s okay with that. They\u2019re just happy together, and I love that. I am really looking forward to the next volume. I want it to focus solely on Ryo, and then on Ryo and Asuka, but as long as it has Ryo in it, I\u2019ll be happy, I think.This review is also available on my blog, with extras."

Una voce che alla fitta trama coniugava l\u00e2\u20ac\u2122atmosfera soffocante del romanzo poliziesco americano, il gesticolare patetico e comico dei grandi personaggi di Samuel Beckett, gli angoscianti dubbi sulla propria identit\u00c3 di Virginia Woolf, e la confusa e allo stesso tempo cruciale caccia ai fantasmi di Henry James. Difficile dare un\u00e2\u20ac\u2122etichetta a un tale romanzo: una donna di circa quarantacinque anni che, di fronte all\u00e2\u20ac\u2122improvvisa e misteriosa morte della madre, tenta di appurare come si sono svolti i fatti.

            "Quem \u00e9 Elena Ferrante?Especula-se, com base nas suas obras, que seja uma mulher, com cerca de 60 anos e que nasceu em N\u00e1poles. S\u00f3 d\u00e1 entrevistas por escrito e apenas o seu editor conhece a sua identidade. O anonimato permite-lhe uma total liberdade na escrita, bem expl\u00edcita nos tr\u00eas romances curtos que comp\u00f5em As Cr\u00f3nicas do Mal de Amor. Delia, Olga e Leda s\u00e3o tr\u00eas mulheres, com hist\u00f3rias de vida distintas, que se aproximam num ponto comum: a Maternidade. S\u00e3o m\u00e3es que amam com loucura os filhos, mas n\u00e3o s\u00e3o as m\u00e3es que a sociedade obriga e aprova, sob pena de serem tituladas de desnaturadas. N\u00e3o pensam que os seus filhos s\u00e3o os melhores e mais perfeitos, por vezes, aborrecem-se com eles, esquecem-nos, desleixam-nos, abandonam-nos... porque s\u00e3o mulheres aut\u00eanticas, imperfeitas, que sentem, que vivem, que amam e odeiam. Os homens destas mulheres, embora sejam o rastilho que despoleta o sofrimento feminino, s\u00e3o tamb\u00e9m eles v\u00edtimas das suas fraquezas e das suas paix\u00f5es, generosos e ego\u00edstas, her\u00f3is e cobardes, fortes e fr\u00e1geis...Com a narrativa na primeira pessoa e com uma escrita pura, sem pejo, por vezes cruel, rude e obscena, Ferrante confrontou-me com mulheres verdadeiras, perante as quais tive de fechar os olhos para n\u00e3o me rever nelas, no seu desespero, no seu ego\u00edsmo, na sua vulnerabilidade, na sua humanidade, ...Os Dias do Abandono foram os mais marcantes e dif\u00edceis de viver, algumas vezes tive de interromper a leitura e senti tanto medo que quase cedi \u00e0 tenta\u00e7\u00e3o cobarde de desistir de Ferrante. Um Estranho AmorA minha m\u00e3e afogou-se na noite de 23 de Maio, dia do meu anivers\u00e1rio...Delia empreende uma busca para saber a causa do suic\u00eddio da m\u00e3e, Amalia, de quem foi sempre distante, e descobre segredos que lhe revelam uma mulher alegre, que amava a vida, embora v\u00edtima de um marido ciumento, obsessivo e violento. Encontra, finalmente, a m\u00e3e e a si pr\u00f3pria. Estava de tal forma decidida a tornar-me diferente dela que perdia uma a uma as raz\u00f5es para ser semelhante.Os Dias do Abandono Num dia de Abril, a seguir ao almo\u00e7o, o meu marido anunciou-me de repente que queria deixar-me. F\u00ea-lo enquanto levant\u00e1vamos a mesa (...) Falou muito dos nossos quinze anos de casamento, dos filhos, e admitiu que n\u00e3o tinha acusa\u00e7\u00f5es a fazer-nos...Olga v\u00ea toda a sua vida desmoronar-se pelo abandono, pela trai\u00e7\u00e3o, pela ingratid\u00e3o, e \u00e9 arrastada num v\u00f3rtice de dor e desespero que amea\u00e7a a destrui\u00e7\u00e3o do seu Ser, tornando-a numa pobre-dela. Mas N\u00e3o era uma mulher que se deixa desfazer em bocados pelos golpes do abandono e da aus\u00eancia, at\u00e9 enlouquecer, at\u00e9 morrer. Empreende uma luta tit\u00e2nica consigo pr\u00f3pria, faz o que era impens\u00e1vel, transforma-se... perde-se... encontra-se... Sou o animal invulner\u00e1vel que atravessa o fogo e n\u00e3o se queima.A Filha Obscura Quando as minhas filhas se mudaram para Toronto, onde o pai vivia e trabalhava h\u00e1 anos, descobri com perplexo espanto que n\u00e3o sentia qualquer desgosto, sentia-me leve, como se s\u00f3 ent\u00e3o as tivesse posto definitivamente no mundo.Leda \u00e9 uma mulher de meia idade que convive com a culpa de n\u00e3o ter sido a m\u00e3e modelo, de ter colocado a carreira profissional na frente da vida familiar. N\u00e3o sei se \u00e9 livro que se recomende. Nem creio que todo o leitor o aprecie. Sei que ler Ferrante \u00e9 uma experi\u00eancia diferente. Uma nova forma de escrever sobre a mulher no seu papel de m\u00e3e. Durante a leitura, veio-me \u00e0 mem\u00f3ria O Amor Incerto de \u00c9lisabeth Badinter, um ensaio, que li h\u00e1 muitos anos, no qual a autora questiona se o amor materno \u00e9 instinto ou \u00e9 apenas um sentimento humano como outro qualquer e como tal incerto, fr\u00e1gil e imperfeito.",
            "Aceitei, durante aquele percurso, contar tudo a mim pr\u00f3pria: tudo aquilo que as mentiras conservavam de verdade.N\u00e3o sabemos quase nada sobre Elena Ferrante, esconde-se numa nuvem de mist\u00e9rio, mas os seus livros, pelo contr\u00e1rio, n\u00e3o t\u00eam nada a esconder. S\u00e3o puros e a honestidade de cada linha entranha-se em n\u00f3s. As suas palavras abrem-nos caminhos para obsess\u00f5es horr\u00edveis, sentimentos perfeitos, emo\u00e7\u00f5es odiosas e personagens perfeitamente imperfeitas. A sinceridade sem limites tira-nos da nossa zona de conforto e habitua-nos \u00e0s personagens, que n\u00e3o nos permitem voltar atr\u00e1s e sermos quem \u00e9ramos.Em tr\u00eas hist\u00f3rias, tr\u00eas grandes mulheres enfrentam problemas pessoais: a morte da m\u00e3e, o abandono do marido por uma mulher mais nova e o sentimento de solid\u00e3o ap\u00f3s as filhas chegaram \u00e0 idade adulta. Mas os problemas n\u00e3o s\u00e3o lineares e dividem-se em mais problemas, levando-nos a conhecer os pensamentos e sentimentos mais \u00edntimos das mulheres, sejam generosos ou ego\u00edstas e cru\u00e9is, sem julgamentos.\u00c9s uma mulher de hoje, agarra-te a tudo o que possas, n\u00e3o recues, n\u00e3o te percas, mant\u00e9m-te direita.",

A forma de escrever de Elena Ferrante est\u00e1 l\u00e1 no entanto a escrita \u00e9 muito mais crua, muito mais dura. A maternidade e as rela\u00e7\u00f5es familiares s\u00e3o o tema comum, mas n\u00e3o s\u00e3o retratadas de um modo id\u00edlico, explorando a escritora as muitas fragilidades do ser humano. ",
            "No contexto geral dos 3 contos ou novelas dou 3 estrelas e dou tamb\u00e9m por encerrada a minha \u201cfase Elena Ferrante\u201d. Tenho de confessar que j\u00e1 foi a custo que terminei de ler este livro porque a determinada altura me come\u00e7ou a irritar a cont\u00ednua culpabilidade de tudo o que lhe acontecia por ser mulher.Os contos s\u00e3o sempre narrados na primeira pessoa por uma mulher e em todos eles ela nunca se sente bem na sua pele. H\u00e1 sempre a tentativa de ser aceite pela sociedade, e acima de tudo pelo homem que \u00e9 suposto am\u00e1-la eternamente. E depois quando as coisas correm mal, h\u00e1 de tal modo uma mudan\u00e7a de comportamento nessa personagem que subitamente passa a ter comportamentos obsessivos e isso irritou-me profundamente. Essa constante pena de si pr\u00f3pria, de vitimiza\u00e7\u00e3o, e os mais que muitos pensamentos em voz alta, repetitivos e ma\u00e7adores cansaram-me.No in\u00edcio de cada conta a est\u00f3ria a prendeu-me como na saga napolitana, mas a certa altura \u2013 em todos eles \u2013 aqui come\u00e7ou a cansar-me. Houve peda\u00e7os de narra\u00e7\u00e3o t\u00e3o longos e repetitivos das mesmas ideias que me apeteceu passar uma p\u00e1gina inteira a ler ao vi\u00e9s. Em muitos aspectos a narradora do conto \u201cOs dias de abandono\u201d remeteu-me de novo para a personagem Elena Greco pois h\u00e1 muitas coisas em comum entre as duas personagens. E, se j\u00e1 na altura, por vezes me irritei com a sua falta de decis\u00e3o e de personalidade, aqui isso voltou a acontecer. \u00c9 talvez a ideia de que todos os problemas das mulheres come\u00e7am (e parece que tamb\u00e9m acabam) nos seus relacionamentos maus com os homens que escolheram ou \u2013 talvez seja mais ainda na vis\u00e3o da autora \u2013 as escolheram a elas que me chateia.Quem sabe talvez tenha sido eu quem n\u00e3o entendeu bem o que a Ferrante quer transmitir por detr\u00e1s de tamanha falta de autoconfian\u00e7a feminina. Digo isto porque no final da narrativa acaba sempre por haver um volte-face e tudo termina bem. Ser\u00e1 que est\u00e1 a querer dizer que as mulheres no fim de contas n\u00e3o precisam de se preocupar porque h\u00e1-de haver em algum lugar do mundo um outro homem que ajude a subir de novo a autoconfian\u00e7a? Se \u00e9 isso... pior ainda.Curioso notar que as tr\u00eas diferentes tradu\u00e7\u00f5es podem ter de algum modo influenciado a minha leitura e ter gostado mais deste ou daquele conto j\u00e1 que anteriormente todos os volumes da saga napolitana que li tinham sido traduzidos pela mesma tradutora. Particularmente n\u2019 \u201cOs dias de abandono\u201d notei que a narradora tomou a certa altura uma postura de vulgar (assumida claramente pela personagem no meio dos seus devaneios) e que a linguagem era realmente forte. T\u00e3o forte ao ponto de eu me sentir quase incomodada o que at\u00e9 aqui ainda n\u00e3o tinha acontecido com outras leituras de Ferrante. E a\u00ed fui ver quem tinha traduzido e percebi de onde me vinha a presen\u00e7a masculina nas suas palavras que n\u00e3o tinha notado nos outros contos \u2013 era um tradutor. E n\u00e3o estou com isto a dizer que ele fez um mau trabalho, nada disso. Eu \u00e9 que n\u00e3o estava habituada. Quem sabe ele talvez tenha sido mais genu\u00edno na sua tradu\u00e7\u00e3o do que a outra tradutora, a cuja tradu\u00e7\u00e3o eu estava habituada. Nunca o saberei. O que eu acho \u00e9 que uma mulher que normalmente n\u00e3o diz asneiras n\u00e3o passa de um momento para o outro a se expressar daquela maneira ordin\u00e1ria, muito menos quando se trata dos seus pensamentos.N\u00e3o pude tamb\u00e9m deixar de notar que como tradutor, (e claro, sei que \u00e9 esse o seu trabalho) e homem, n\u00e3o deve ter sido f\u00e1cil escrever todas essas insanidades contra os homens que a Olga pensa e diz.Acho que Ferrante, no fim de contas \u00e9 apenas e tudo mais do mesmo. O que significa que apesar de todo este alarido com a saga napolitana n\u00e3o acredito que fique para a est\u00f3ria (talvez em It\u00e1lia sim) dos grandes escritores da nossa \u00e9poca. Mas posso estar enganada e estar por a\u00ed a aparecer brevemente outra saga... quem sabe? ,-)",
            "Lo que hace Ferrante con sus mujeres es digno de m\u00e9rito. Tira de la cuerda, y tira, y tira, poni\u00e9ndolas en situaciones l\u00edmites y dejando que hagan cosas que en ocasiones pueden resultar ruines y mezquinas (como robar la mu\u00f1eca de una ni\u00f1a de dos a\u00f1os). Gracias a ese tipo de giros podemos conocerlas, amarlas, odiarlas, comprenderlas y desconcertarnos. Pero qu\u00e9 bien escribe y que buenas historias sobre madres e hijas cuenta Ferrante. Es normal que la fiebre por ella no decaiga sino que m\u00e1s bien aumente cuanto m\u00e1s la lees \u2763\ufe0f",

E, depois, gostava da escrita que nos faz debru\u00e7ar a cada linha e olhar para baixo, sentindo a vertigem da profundidade, as trevas do inferno.\u00bbAs tr\u00eas mulheres deste livro - tantas quanto as cr\u00f3nicas que cont\u00e9m - fazem parte de uma nova vaga de mulheres diferentes da gera\u00e7\u00e3o das suas m\u00e3es, est\u00e3o profundamente marcadas pela sua inf\u00e2ncia e usam uma linguagem obscena.S\u00e3o mulheres que se estudam com precis\u00e3o, se despem das suas m\u00e1scaras, reagem e assumem os seus comportamentos.S\u00e3o mulheres que amam demais. Mulheres que amam profundamente as suas m\u00e3es e os seus filhos, tudo fazem por eles, mas nada deixam de fazer por eles."

La violenza psicologica che serpeggia dall\u2019inizio alla fine.L\u2019assenza di buoni sentimenti senza un lato oscuro, a cominciare proprio da quelli familiari, di regola considerati i pi\u00f9 rassicuranti.Donne protagoniste tutte nate a Napoli e poi trasferite pi\u00f9 a nord, che pensano tutte alla madre in modo ossessivo, vincolo dal quale non riescono a liberarsi.Donne protagoniste che si portano dentro instabilit\u00e0 e infelicit\u00e0, vissute come una colpa, condanna da espiare, perch\u00e9 in questa societ\u00e0 l\u2019angoscia \u00e8 ormai uno scandalo.Vivian MaierLa dualit\u00e0 dialetto/italiano che ha un peso rilevante: in questi tre primi romanzi, l\u2019insulto, la volgarit\u00e0, l\u2019oscenit\u00e0 si esprimono pi\u00f9 facilmente liberamente e intensamente in dialetto, che appartiene alle viscere, mentre la serenit\u00e0, il razionale, il garbo si traduce in italiano, che appartiene alla ragione (le cose cambiano in qualche modo nei romanzi saga de \u2018L\u2019amica geniale\u2019).Ruth Orkin"

            "Sometimes your book reading experience comes down to one single factor: Do you like the MC?That character can make or break a book.Name the biggest praise and the biggest complaint about J.D. Salinger's Catcher in the Rye. If you said they're both Holden Caulfield then you get the gold star. This book was teetering on a precipice for me. It could either land back on solid ground or go toppling off into the deep end. eventually, the main characters, Aria and Perry, are what stacked it back to being a great read.There's a lot to like about Rossi's futuristic science-fiction novel. The world building is fascinating and vivid, yet simplistic enough for most audiences to grasp reasonably well. The writing is fair enough and I felt that it was reasonably tight and serviceable. It wasn't a perfect novel but I feel that it achieved what it was meant to and that was inspiring me to invest in Aria and Perry's story. Mostly I'm just impressed with Rossi because she clearly is a badass.I can just imagine how her meeting with the editor went:Ms. Rossi, thank you for coming. We love your first copy but we're concerned about this Aether thing. What is it? Where did it come from? How does it work?Rossi sits back in her chair and kicks her feet up onto the editor's table. She pulls out a raw falcon egg and starts eating it. So? she asks between bites.Well, you never clarify how it works? Why it's there? How did it come to be there?Rossi shrugs casually. Meh. I don't give a shit. It's there. YA takes it for granted that a 108 year old vampire would fall in love with a teenager. They'll figure out this Aether shit. They have google.But- the editor tries to continue.Rossi pins the editor with a withering gaze. I could devote ten boring pages to giving some lameass sciency explanation of the Aether or I could add in 20% more awesome. Also, I know how to falcon punch. I learned it from the mother of this egg I stole before I gave a right hook and uppercut to a shark.The editor decides that surrender is the better part of valor and everyone learns an important lesson that day. Especially the wild life. The End.So basically, I like this book, and even if Rossi does eat raw falcon eggs, I like her characters and I like her style.And hopefully you will too. If you know what's good for you.This review also appears on my blog, Cuddlebuggery Book Blog.",
            "2.5 stars My feelings on Under the Never Sky are fair to middling. Overall, it had a lot of potential, but unfortunately, I had a hard time staying interested in the story and invested in the characters. The book is one of many recent dystopian-lite novels that have been cropping up in the YA market recently, and while I don't always mind books that are less focused on the world-building as long as something else is done well, neither the characters nor the plot were so outstanding here that they could keep me fully engaged. My partner also bailed about halfway through our readalong, if that counts for anything.Here's what I liked about the book:--The overall concept--Occasional humor in the writing--Interesting shorthand for words, which makes sense in a futuristic society: champ, rancy, wrathy are all great examples of the way language might evolve or devolve, depending on how you look at it--cool Smarteye technology--a couple of interesting action sequences including a decapitation!Here's what I didn't care for:--The girl is much too trusting and had to be rescued over and over, to the point that you want to scream at her. She also isn't all that compelling of a protagonist, and is also occasionally very rude and rather ungrateful.--The names. Aria (GUESS WHAT SHE DOES), Paisley, Lumina, Aria, Echo, Peregrine I'm rather ashamed to say that I was glad when Paisley bit it, because I was so happy I didn't have to read her name anymore.--Interchangeable secondary characters--Weird things that are mentioned in passing but never really explained. Soren's underwater birthday party, no stains, not getting hurt in the Realms' virtual reality type situation, blood lords, the Tides' superhuman senses, etc.--Rather uninspired she did this, he did that type of writing. Everything is explained as an afterthought and random snippets suddenly dropped, there\u2019s no gradual lead in for it in the narrative.--Some writing choices that didn't quite work as well as the examples in the like section, such as \u201csweaty seaweed or \u201chis nephew\u2019s temper had grown dark and damp.\u201d Those just don't make sense to me. There were also some awkward sentences, such as Perry woke sweated to his clothes.--What is with all the birdish names? Peregrine, Talon, Lumina (which is a type of falcon), etc? I came away from Under the Never Sky feeling rather aggressively indifferent to it. There were moments when the book was fairly entertaining and there were moments when I was extremely bored, so it worked out to be a pretty uneven reading experience. My partner and I really spent most of the time during the two weeks of our readalong asking questions, however. What the HELL is aether? How is he doing this? I don't get it! and so on and so forth, because so many things were introduced and then dropped and never explained. And even if we got answers, they didn't really provide lightbulb moments so much as a grudging concession that an attempt was made to explain something.Overall, this book felt similar to me to Blood Red Road, Divergent, and Legend, in that they are all very much action-oriented stories. But the difference is, those books had much stronger and more memorable characters, who took initiative and made things happen. Those novels were also, for all their admitted flaws, just plain fun. For me, that element was sorely lacking in this story and I was disappointed to find that I wasn't nearly as excited about this book as many of my friends have been--and that's saying something for a book where there are cannibals.But look! I snapped this Under the Never Sky moment at the beach in January. I do like the title quite a bit, even if I still have no idea what it means.Random Side Notes:There is NO WAY that what Perry thinks smells like violets actually smells like violets, no matter how advanced our society becomes. Also, I wish my skin were as velvety as a mushroom.An advance copy was provided by the publisher for this review.",
            "As seen on The ReadventurerMy opinion about Under the Never Sky is similar to the one I have about Unearthly. I am not going to claim that these books are ground-breaking or Printz-worthy. But in their genres, dystopia/post-apocalyptic and PNR respectively, they are as good as it gets. They are well written and entertaining, with characters and relationships that do not annoy and make you roll your eyes. The summary of Under the Never Sky does this book a disservice. It is accurate enough, but overwhelms you with weird names of things and places. I'll try to explain the plot in a, hopefully, simpler way. In a distant future, our (I assume) planet is ravaged by strange climate changes that make living on the surface quite rough. A big part of the population now exists inside huge, self-supporting, sealed from the outside domes. This group of people finds its only relief from the tediousness of the confined, sterilized living in virtual realities. The other half of the population barely survives outside. Food is scarce, climate dangerous, the living is primal, only the fittest survives.Aria belongs to the sheltered kind, Perry - to the savage kind. When Aria is expelled from the security of her dome, she joins Perry, and together they ally to reach their separate goals.While Under the Never Sky is hardly super-original, whatever genre tropes are used in it, are done exactly to my taste. The novel has dual narration, but the choices Veronica Rossi made here work just right. 3rd person helps her avoid the customary similarities between her characters' voices. The switches between the POVs always happen when it is the most advantageous, no repetitiveness, no excessive navel-gazing (also, very frequent whenever 2-POV structure is used).Another plus, Under the Never Sky is more of an adventure story, rather than romance (thank you, Jesus! I mean, Harper Teen). The love story line is strong, but the romance is slow-burning, not angsty, not overwhelming. The priorities are straight here - there are more important things in the characters' lives than a few days-long romantic relationships, things like families and loyalties. Finally, the characters. I really liked Aria and Perry, especially Perry. There is a soft spot in my heart for a guy who is understanding of and helpful during the special lady days (aka periods).Basically, Under the Never Sky, in my eyes, is a perfect mix of adventure and love, sci-fi and romance, entertainment and heartbreak. I am definitely coming back for more. ",
            "'Under the Never Sky' had been sitting on my TBR list for years. I had heard so many great things about it, but since it isn't my usual type of story, I kept putting it off. Recently, the Audible edition was on sale and so I picked it up and decided to finally give it a go.Unfortunately, this book left me feeling a little disappointed. It was good, but I expected to be blown away after all of the hype. Again, this isn't my normal type of read. Maybe if I were a big adventure/fantasy/dystopian/sci-fi reader then I would have loved it. I'm not and it ended up being okay for me.This is a futuristic dystopian story, with sharply divided sects of people. There are the dwellers, who live in enclosed compounds, such as Reverie, where Aria is from. The dwellers live a virtual existence, never leaving the confines of their compounds, but experiencing different realms through the use of a device called a smarteye. In many ways, they are the privileged class, but their entire existence is a lie facilitated by the use of virtual reality.Outside of the dweller compounds there are several different tribes. These people live under the harsh conditions of the tumultuous Aether, with danger lurking everywhere. They are viewed as primitive and barbaric by the dwellers, simply referred to as the outsiders. Some are hunters, some are cannibals and some possess supernatural abilities. They are as harsh as the environment in which they live.When Aria is cast out of her dweller compound, she sets off in search of her mother. A scientist working at the compound Bliss, her mother has gone missing. Despite finding herself in a dangerous situation that she is unprepared to navigate, Aria is determined to make her way to Bliss and find her mother.Before long, Aria crosses paths with Perry. Perry is an outsider and an exceptional hunter. He has the ability to scent things that are undetectable to others, from great distances. His supernatural ability has been an asset to his tribe, even as he exists in the periphery under his brother's rule.When Perry's nephew is stolen by dwellers and taken to a compound for studies, Perry sets out to rescue him. He partners with Aria to find the dweller compound. They form a friendship based on necessity. Aria needs Perry to survive in the Outside world that is foreign to her. He needs her to find his way to the dweller compound and to gain entry.The two set out on their journey, against all odds. Along the way, they face multiple threats and setbacks. Amidst the danger, Perry and Aria's relationship grows into far more than a partnership based on necessity. They fall in love, even knowing that their relationship would be forbidden. Outsiders and dwellers do not like one another.While there were parts of this story that I did enjoy, like the love story between Aria and Perry. I had a hard time connecting with the storyline. I wanted to get lost in the world that the author crafted, but I just couldn't. The whole dystopian, futuristic setting was kind of grim and off-putting to me. In the end, this ended up being an okay read for me. I can see the appeal, but it just wasn't my cuppa. There were things that I liked about the story, but it just wasn't the type of story that speaks to me or is particularly compelling for me. If you're a big adventure/fantasy/sci-fi reader, then you'll probably appreciate this one far more than I did."

Innocent Spouse is an eye-opening memoir that asks a provocative and disturbing question: Is it possible to really know and trust someone, even your spouse? Carol Ross Joynt was a successful television producer in Washington, D.C. Her husband, Howard, owned Nathans, a legendary restaurant in Georgetown. From an outsider\u2019s perspective, Carol and Howard lived a fairy-tale life\u2014spending weekends at their Chesapeake Bay estate, rubbing shoulders with New York\u2019s and Washington\u2019s elite, and raising their beloved son, Spencer. But everything changed with Howard\u2019s sudden death when Spencer was only five years old. Like any widow, Carol was devastated because she lost the love of her life and her son\u2019s father. But soon Carol had much more to cope with than her grief and new life as a single parent. As she was forced to take over her family\u2019s legal and financial responsibilities, as well as run Howard\u2019s restaurant on her own, Carol discovered that her husband had secrets, and one of them, an almost $3 million debt to the IRS, threatened to derail her entire life.

            "Carol Ross Joynt used to be like me. Very rough idea what the family income is, vague knowledge of investments and annuities, no idea how to fill out an IRS return. Like me, she just spent money and let her husband pay the bills.Unfortunately, her husband Howard, wasn\u2019t as honest as mine. Shortly after he died unexpectedly at age 57 in 1997 she got a call from his lawyers to come to a meeting. She figured she would sign a few papers and find out how much income she and her five-year-old son could expect. But there would be no income. In fact, there was a debt of some $3,000,000 owed the IRS, who were considering indicting her for criminal tax fraud. Her husband had owned Nathan\u2019s, a very popular Georgetown bar and restaurant, and he had for years been failing to send along to the IRS the payroll taxes he withheld from employees\u2019 pay.She discovered the restaurant had not paid its way for decades. When her father-in-law was alive he would \u201clend\u201d Howard a million or two to keep the place afloat. After his death Howard, unable to pay the rent and the vendors, started stealing from the IRS.And now Carol was in their bullseye. Shocked, she told the lawyers that she had no idea this was happening. \u201cYou HAD to have known,\u201d said a savvy young female tax lawyer who no doubt has a firm grasp of her family\u2019s income and financial details. Carol did not, as I do not. Like me she trusted her husband entirely. Unfortunately she trusted a man who was not trustworthy. (I am SO lucky.)Finding that her lawyers thought her guilty, Carol looked around and found another firm where the lawyers believed in her innocence. They filed for IRS Innocent Spouse relief. To be eligible for this the widow (a woman 99% of the time I\u2019m sure) had to have taken no part in the fraud, to have known nothing of what was being done, and to have benefitted not at all from it. She met the first two criteria, but how could she not have benefitted from Howard\u2019s doings? She thought the restaurant was profitable. She thought Howard\u2019s trust fund from his father\u2019s estate was much more than it was. (I believe her every word. And I can\u2019t imagine what it was like to face this kind of financial nightmare.) Fortunately the woman is incredibly feisty and so for years she struggled to run Nathan\u2019s legally, get rid of employees who were stealing and otherwise sabotaging the restaurant, bring in new faces who could make changes in the now-decaying restaurant, all the while knowing the gains from her work might go to the IRS and she might not reap a dime from the business except as a paid employee. To keep going she sold their antique furniture, their house on the bay, their boat, their apartment, everything. She managed to get IRS approval to buy a small house for her and her son. And she kept working and she worried.Meanwhile, she was trying to hold on to her job as a producer for Larry King Live. She was a specialist in \u201chard gets,\u201d people like Sarah Ferguson, Paul Newman, Donatella Versace, and the pope, people who had for years been saying no to an appearance on Larry King\u2019s show \u2013 and every other talk show on TV. (She did get the first three to appear. The pope was more elusive.) As she spent more and more time with her son, trying to keep the restaurant afloat, and dealing with the IRS, her job performance declined. And there is no mercy in TV land.Read the book to find out how it all turned out, what the IRS decided on her Innocent Spouse appeal, what she was left with when it was all over. And read it for inspiration. Here\u2019s a woman whose world fell apart overnight but who managed to struggle to keep Nathan\u2019s open, to keep her head above water, to remake her TV job, to spend time with her son. And to sail eventually into calm waters.2011 No 88 Coming soon: Emma, by Jane Austen",
            "Finally done. This is an interesting story, but it could have been told in about 1/3rd the pages. It's overwritten and repetitive. We get it - you owed the IRS money. Wrap it up lady!ps. I don't believe for one second that she didn't know the drinking age is 21. And I also think she exaggerated many of the things her child said. Five yr olds don't speak that way.",

            "The author's husband dies, leaving her with a ton of bills. Going into it I thought maybe there was more to it than that, that he had died with a bunch of deep dark secrets. The author lived a pretty fancy lifestyle and never questioned where her husband got the money and then was pretty clueless when he suddenly died and she was suddenly responsible for the debt. She just goes on and on talking about all the debt and when she isnt doing that she's talking about her 5 year old son. I guess I was expecting a more intricate story but this is basically it."

            "This was enthusiastically recommended to me by a friend and I took it with me on a long airplane trip. I was disappointed, too long, too repetitive and rather self-serving, I thought. The bare facts of the story are fascinating: the author was widowed in her 40s and her adored husband was revealed to be hugely dishonest and manipulative. Like another reviewer, I would have liked to know more about the IRS process of deciding she was an innocent spouse, rather than what she wore to the various meetings with her lawyers. The constant name-dropping was, after the first couple of times, really irritating. One can appreciate her grit and determination to make a life for herself and her son, but there were too many details about the fluff and too few about the meat, and the writing itself was rather mediocre.",
            "An author with a great desire to drop names and appeal for sympathy. She just didn't cut it for me. She is left a widow at age 47 and quickly discovers the wealth she thought her husband had amassed was really an IRS case for tax fraud and deceit. She then describes her husband as a rascal and his legal problems as shenanigans. Really? She herself worked as a newscaster, for Larry King, Walter Cronkite, David Brinkley and Chris Matthews, to name a few, and yet proclaimed to be such an innocent. In fact though, the IRS did eventually claim her to be 'innocent spouse', which left her off the hook for much of the debt. I guess she didn't sell her innocence well enough for me. I found the story she told of Walter Cronkite to be most unbelievable. Hmmmm, didn't like the book!",
            "This book was fascinating. Her husband dies and she finds out that he was a big liar, a cheat by not paying his taxes, and she never really knew who he was. The strong woman had to weed her way through an IRS probe, raising a sad little 5-yr-old son, and run her husbands restaurant/bar, which was in dire financial trouble. Very interesting, loved it.",

            "Not half bad as these books go, with a well thought out plot line. I guess the problem is that as I get older and older I've seen so many stories develop that from the start I knew immediately both who would be guilty and who would temporarily appear to be the villian. You know how you've seen so many actors that catching sight of a character actor on Law and Order immediately tips you off that he's the criminal as they wouldn't pay extra just for a witness. This book had the same effect on the page, those paper characters I have seen before and I know the trajectory for each one.

            "Going through books I never read to see what I'm selling to Half Price and what's going with me during my move. This one is going to Half Price.the good:- the story about Selina hunting down the man killing sex workers- Selina taking down dirty cops- all of the interactions with Leslie Thompson- Holly and her relationship with Selina- Cooke's art was unique- appearance of Allen, one of the cops from Gotham Centralthe bad:- it took about 70 or so pages before there was any real character development for Selina. - the story at the start is every single noir detective story ever. There was nothing unique about it, Selina just felt like a stand in for any other protagonist from Brubaker's crime stories, it felt more like he pitched a story like the books he wrote later on, and they let him slide Selina in as the main character. Except, because she didn't feel distinct as a female character, it didn't feel like the story was about her really. - I didn't care for the first story at all. I was so put off that I took me forever to pick this book up again because I just flat out didn't want to- the story from the private eye trying to follow Selina was as cliche as the first heist story and I could not muster any fucks to giveThis book only worked for me when it centered Selina as a champion for the people of Gotham that nobody, even Batsy, seems to care about. The homeless, sex workers, former addicts, children in gang neighborhoods and people screwed over by dirty cops (which is all of the aforementioned). This works as such a great contrast to the often racist, classist stories in Dixon's Robin run because Tim Drake is a rich kid that only sees the good in other rich, white children and Selina is a woman of color (she was Cuban and they keep forgetting that), a former sex worker (at least implied, it's a bit fudgy in this book), she lived on the streets and she didn't come from money. She understands the people she helps in a way the batclan (excluding Jason) never will. It's why her grey morality has always worked for me. Unfortunately, a lot of these elements that worked for me weren't what Brubaker wanted to focus on. And unfortunately, I just don't give a damn about his noir detective drama stories. "

            "Catwoman Volume one: Trail of the Catwoman is a 2012 DC Comics publication. (Originally published in 2008) Because I named my new kitten, Selina, after Catwoman, it was only fitting that I catch up on a few Catwoman comics for fun. There are SO many to choose from, I had a hard time deciding where to begin. This one was on Hoopla and it seemed to be well received- so I thought this might be a good place to dive in. This volume is hefty. Selina\u2019s Big score, plus detective comics 759-762 = Three hundred + pages. Why I am drawn to the Catwoman character is her complexity. She\u2019s got a painful past, has not always walked on good side of the law, but is a character who wants to be a good person-at least in this volume of stories. In this collection, Selina has faked her own death. She returns to Gotham City, has a little bit of a makeover, and then begins doing some detective work, hoping to find a serial killer targeting sex -workers. The action takes place in the East End where the people need an equalizer of Catwoman\u2019s caliber. The first part of the novel is part heist, part noir, and sets the stage Selina/Catwoman\u2019s new outlook on life. I enjoyed the graphics, dialogue and stories included in this collection. I have even more angles of Catwoman to ponder on and found this volume to be entertaining and a nice diversion for me. Now on to Volume 2.",
            "This is a mixed bag. First, I really liked the Catwoman issues included in this collection. These stories show Catwoman leaving behind her villainous past and turning over a new leaf as a hero for the downtrodden. Catwoman shows compassion for people from her past, which makes her a very likable character.Second, there are some Slam Bradley stories included in this collection. Those focus on a private detective who is trying to find out who Catwoman is. Catwoman doesn't appear much in these stories. Overall, I'd say that these are OK.Finally, Selina's Big Score is included. This is a pretty popular story, but aside from the art, I pretty much hated it. My biggest problem is that Catwoman seems like a supporting character in this story. The person who takes the lead is a character named Stark. Stark is an amoral criminal mastermind who, according to this story, is the person that taught Selina how to be a criminal. He is a misogynistic, amoral jerk, but the story sets him up as someone to look up to. Catwoman gets romantically involved with him even if there hint that he cares about her. In fact he even threatens to kill her at times. I'm not into reading stories that show that kind of disrespect to women.",
            "This book is an easy five-star review, a gift for fans of crime comics, even those fans who (like me) don't generally like DC comics. The collection begins with a masterpiece of a graphic novel, in which Catwoman returns to Gotham after faking her death - to put together one last big heist. The story has a delicious retro feel, like the reader can almost hear the slow jazz music, smell last night's cigarettes, taste the burn of the cheap booze. The tale picks up a lot of notes from The Killers, more the 1964 version than the 1946, even to the point of dropping Angie Dickinson's name in a running gag, and when the graphic novel ends, we get a four-part story of what the detective was up to between panels of the novel. It's a great way to tie up some loose ends and enrich some backstory without distracting from the quick and deliberate pacing of that first story. Throughout both stories, we get gorgeous illustrations by Darwyn Cooke, luxurious to the point where looking through the images feels like trailing your fingers along velvet, drawing out Catwoman's sensuality without diminishing her strength.Next, we get nine issues of a Catwoman monthly series, which are something of a step down from the giddy wonder of the book's first third, but they're still great. Brubaker writes a new version of Selina Kyle in a role taking care of the defenseless residents of Gotham's East End, much like Daredevil shepherds Hell's Kitchen in the Marvel Universe. We get hookers and drug mules and crooked cops, with a surprising number of sympathetic characters who are trying to make do with what they've got. Darwyn Cooke draws the first four issues, in a style that is a bit more restrained for mainstream readers but still strikingly his own, then Brad Rader picks up the pencil for the next five issues. While Rader's work isn't quite as confident and beguiling as Cooke's, it certainly pays homage to Cooke and makes an easy transition for the reader.Catwoman fans will, I assume, surely love this exploration of a dynamic and powerful character, and crime story fans will certainly turn the pages with a nostalgic awe. My brother loaned me his copy as part of an heroic effort to find DC comics that I will enjoy with him, and after I return it I may need to buy a copy for my own collection.",
            "You get a lot of bang for your buck in this trade. First, a reprint of Darwyn Cooke's Catwoman: Selina's Big Score, then a series of Slam Bradley shorts that were originally in the back pages of Detective Comics, and finally the first nine issues of Brubaker's Catwoman. They share a similar, noirish sensibility (especially Selina's Big Score, which is a pure heist story), stylish art, and a take on Catwoman that is part gentleman thief, part friend to the friendless. It's a great take on the character, one that I think makes sense considering her accumulated history and sensibilities. If you read and liked Gotham Central, you'll almost certainly like this take on Catwoman, too. ",
            "Wow, this one is exciting!What\u2019s it about?This collection contains 4 stories about DC\u2019s famous anti-hero, Catwoman, written by Ed Brubaker!Pros:The stories are fun and interesting.The cartoony and colorful illustrations are absolutely wonderful!This book is action packed and exciting throughout. I never got bored while reading this.It\u2019s not a huge thing in the book but there are some fun little comic relief moments.I often complain that Marvel and DC books can get a bit predictable but there are some exceptions, this is one of them. There\u2019s lots of suspense! I should expect no less from a Brubaker book!Why not 5 stars?The characters are sort of uninteresting to me. Selina does some cool stuff and all but outside of action scenes and fan service she doesn\u2019t seem to have much personality. Her friend/sidekick is kinda meh. Slam is kinda cool but a very typical comic book PI. The others are sort of meh.Overall:If the characters were a bit cooler I would have given this 5 stars, that being said, I gave it 4 and would recommend this, especially if you\u2019re a fan of Brubaker\u2019s other work.4/5",
            "What's new, pussycat? A lot for Selina Kyle. Having faked her death, as well as that of her alter-ego, the Catwoman, Selina finds herself in a bind when a heist goes sour. Out of money and out of contacts, she returns to Gotham City to begin her old life in a new way.Catwoman: Volume 1, Trail of the Catwoman is a collection of several story arcs, covering Darwyn Cooke's graphic novel Selina's Big Score, back stories from Detective Comics and Catwoman issues 1-9, authored by Ed Brubaker. This is collection is cohesive and meaty, just the way I like them, and well worth the $29.99 (although I read the library's copy. I may just buy one for myself sometime).Selina's Big Score  begins the new Catwoman saga, as she returns to Gotham, gets word of a big score and puts together a team for the heist. It has the feel of a Parker novel, and it's probably no coincidence that Selina teams up with a guy named Stark with whom she has a history, a neat little homage to Parker. Darwyn Cooke's writing is great and his art has a nice retro feel, with broad brushstrokes, simple colors and crisp chiaroscuros. It also has a bit of a rough edge, which I welcome in today's world of overly-polished, computer-assisted comic art.Trail of the Catwoman, also by Darwyn Cooke, is a related story arc, that features Slam Bradley, the hard-boiled private investigator, who is hired by the mayor of Gotham to investigate the death of Catwoman/Selina Kyle. In doing so, Slam is exposed to the dark underbelly of Gotham corruption. Slam's a real cool character and tougher than leather. I like this guy a lot.The stories from the Catwoman comic are Anodyne and Disguises, both written by the excellent Ed Brubaker and illustrated by Darwyn Cooke and others. The stories do a good job of showing how dark and seedy Gotham City really is, as well as Selina's perspective of it. For example, Batman makes an brief appearance, but he sort of comes off as a bit of a self-righteous prick, which I guess sort of makes sense from Selina's street-wise, grayscale perspective.Catwoman: Volume 1, Trail of the Catwoman is a great book. I'm looking forward to reading the second volume. (By the way, saying What's new, pussycat? to Selina Kyle probably isn't a great way to make friends with her. I'm sure that Tom Jones gets a pass, though. That guy's pretty smooth)."

            "Last Sunday visiting my nieces and nephew, my niece El Darisa Zuleykha gave me a book for me to read it loud. Darisa is barely 2 years old but she loves books and she loves to listen to story telling. Just like me when I was small.The book, When I'm Feeling Sad by Trace Moroney is about a little bunny which was sad. This book taught children that it's ok to feel sad and what to do when sadness evolves. The illustration to the book is cleverly done to show the sadness. Gray colour, windy day with leaves dropping depicted the sadness. Darisa kept on saying Rabbit nangis... while showing the picture of the rabbit with tears in it's eyes. She clearly shown her emphaty to the bunny by patting the bunny in the page. Ah! A child full with emotion.The best part was at the end of the book, it showed what is the best thing to do to relieve sadness. The bunny went to it's mum to get a hug. When I told Darisa,  Do you want to hug your mummy, Darisa?, she straight away went to hug her mummy. Awwww... That is so sweet.I find this book helps children (and adult too!) to understand sadness and how to cope with it. When I went through some of the reviews written by readers about this book in Goodreads, a reader wrote that this book helped her little son who suffered from deppression. A really good book to introduce to your small one.Trace Moroney also wrote a series of books with feeling concept. The tittles to some of the books are :When I'm Feeling Jealous.When I'm Feeling Loved.When I'm Feeling Angry.When I'm Feeling Lonely.Will try to find these books later, InsyaAllah.",
            "This book does a good job using color to depict the emotion in the story. The bunny goes through a range of emotions. Somethign tragic happens to the family and they must learn how to cope with the different dynamics. This is a great story for children dealing with death. This story helps children understand that this can happen, and it is ok to go through different stages of emotion. This is a normal reaction and it is important to take the different steps for their health. This is a good, and easy read, but very impactful.",

            "The colors in this book are often associated with what it feels like to be sad. It gives children a tangible meaning to sadness. It offers suggestions on what to do if a child is feeling sad. It also opens the door for children to learn how to label that feeling. The pictures follow the story evenly."

            "Ok book for introducing the concept of doubling numbers. The text isn\u2019t particularly engaging. ",
            "Double the Ducks by Stuart Murphy is a number book that is geared towards first graders.Doubling Ducks focuses on doubling numbers. A boy has five ducks that he cares for. The boy uses his two hands to feed them three sackes of food each day and give them shelter with four bundles of hay. The five ducks went for a walk but each brought back a friend with them. That means the boy has double the work and needs double the food (six sacks), double the hay (8 bundles), and an extra set of hands (4 hands) to take care of them.Activites:1. Each student should make a doubles book. Each page should have a heading such as Double 1 or Double 2. The students should think of objects that would go in each category. For example, Double 1 might be a head with two ears.2. Have students get into groups of two. Have one child in each group think of a number and then double it. That stuent should share with the other child their doubled number. The second student should guess the original number. The students should take turns guessing each others doubled numbers.",
            "This book would be helpful in showing how to double numbers under 10. It would be fun to do this with students who are just learning about addition and subtraction as they could try some invented strategies of their own as the farmer needs double the items for double the ducks that he has. Also, the word doubling can be hard for kids to understand but using this book could help them visually understand how the number of ducks changed. I could see using this book with manipulatives and allowing students to work on answers on their own."

            "The key ideas here are counting and doubling. On most pages, you can count the item being discussed both in the main illustration and in the box in the upper right corner. The exception is the hay pages, the bundles of hay aren't shown in the main illustration.The counts are a little contrived/unbelievable. The story is also very devoted to linearity, which makes sense in most but maybe not all of the cases.",
            "The concept is good, but it doesn't feel real. Why would it take 3 bags of food to feed 5 ducks? Why would it take 4 bales of hay to make nests for 5 ducks?The idea is that he has 5 ducks that he cares for. Each duck brings home a friend and suddenly he has twice the work and needs twice the supplies.",
            "Math made easy for kids to understand. ",
            "This book focuses on doubling numbers/ adding a number to itself in a fun way. There are games available in the back of the book that would give you an idea of how to play double games. Once the number of ducks are doubled, the boy must double the number of hay and food needed. This story could be a nice introduction to fraction concepts as well. Students could understand that for every 5 ducks, one boy is needed to take care of them. So what if there were 10 ducks/the ducks were doubled? 5 ducks need 4 stacks of hay. How much would 10 ducks need? Students could express this in fraction form.",
            "Use this book to reinforce the introduction of doubling a number for a math lesson. A great activity would be to have students recreate the story using objects from the classroom, this would allow students practice in doubling a number. Students could also use dominoes to practice picking out the doubles. Concentration is another activity that would allow students to pick out doubles. A twist to concentration would be to have a child make a pair, such as 5 and 5, then make them also find the sum, in this case 10. So they would have to find all 3 cards to be able to pick them up.",
            "Double the Ducks is a good introduction to the concept of doubles for children. Two is the equivalent of one doubled and the doubles pattern can be identified as a child counts up. A teacher could instruct their students to play Double Me following the story. Double Me is a game I was introduced to by my professor, Dr. Smith. Each student takes turns rolling a number dice. The students double the number they rolled and cover that number on their board. The winner is the first student to cover their entire board."

Oblivion is a friend and Oblivion is a foe.The book is the narration of the Munk Debate of 2011. It's quite readable and intriguing to see those perceptions of scholars collide with each other. But IMHO, the name of the book \u201cwill 21st century belong to China?\u201d was a little bit misleading, inflammatory or even to some extent\u2026aggressive, better to be modified as \u201cwill China be a good global player\u201d or something like that.Four scholars took the debate, including the pre-eminent Dr. Henry Kissinger, whose books I was engaging for the time being. To a little of my distress, only one scholar from China participated in the debate. Come on! Now that it's a debate about China, how could it that only one Chinese scholar was involved? And IMHO again, David li was indeed a prestigious scholar but some other scholars in China could do the job competently as well, maybe even better.The debate was a sort of lenghy and I could only memorized some of the the core ideas and Perhaps quite incomplete. Professor Ferguson\uff08I didn't read his works\uff09apparently subscribed to the emergence of China as a global power. He perceived China is a continent instead of a mere country with conventional definitions, which I found quite insightful. He did a good job in understanding the long history of this country. He seemed to look at China as an exceptional phenomenon rather than what a country is. Incisive indeed!Dr. Kissinger was the first one to modify the debate direction. It's not about whether China will be a global power nor is it about the 21st century belongs to China or the United States or any other country. It's about Whether China can incorperate itself into the global order and continuously contribute its own intelligence in favor of the evolvement and evolution of the new better order and benefits of all the people around the globe.There must be certain worries about China's ascent to a global power, especially for a country once humiliated by so many foreign powers in its contemporary history. And professor David Li gave a persuasive explanation. What China wants is not seeking global dominance,which didn't exist in its cultures, nor it will brandish its power to take revenge on those who once humiliated this country. What it genuinely yearn for is to restore its historical glory,as Tang dynasty did. It's an inspiration derived from its long history and nothing could change that. Once you got there and once you went such far and reached such grandeur and why you cannot do it now?! OMG! That is it! That is exactly what I want to say! Great job there, David li . I cannot agree with all of your opinions but this piece is really something I so appreciate.And some domestic scholars I really like almost share the same perceptions.Grant the book three and a half stars. Because It's informative but failed to cover a grand range of dementions of China given the limited time of the debate. Look at the clock! I guess I would fail to climb out of the bed next morning to catch up with the class if I continue . Too bad.",

            "\u201cDoes the 21st Century Belong to China?\u201d between Niall Ferguson, David Daokui Li, Fareed Zakaria and Henry Kissinger was one of the more informative Munk Debates especially for those unfamiliar with historic and contemporary Sino-U.S. (Anglo-Saxon) relations. This debate touches on most of the primary issues regarding China\u2019s prospective rise or impeding collapse as well as its containment. Most of it centers on China\u2019s time between 1978 and the present as China liberalized toward a market economy.The \u201cpro\u201d side focused on China\u2019s economic rise, and the increasing gap between its economic and political development, the latter of which they contend has not kept pace with the former. Given China\u2019s natural resource requirements to sustain this growth, and their internal instabilities, the pro side felt China would grow increasingly bellicose and imperialist economically if not militarily. This was contested. The \u201ccon\u201d side attributed China\u2019s exponential growth to a \u201ccatch-up\u201d phase whereby growth comes easy as the less developed country borrows existing ideas and technologies from those more advanced using the Asian Tigers and the slow-down of Japan as examples. With respect to an emerging dominance, Kissinger contended that China is emerging as a power among equals, which is not only unique to its history, but a maxim that applies to all countries including the United States. The countries on China\u2019s periphery are loathe to its rise, have more favourable demographics and could easily coalesce into a league for containment should the need arise. With respect to economic projections, Kissinger explained that comparisons of projected GDPs are distorted. For whatever GDP accrues, China has to distribute its resources far more broadly which results in a far lower per capita GDP when compared with the West. This distribution would also have to close the gap between China\u2019s interior and its coastal zones, a process that will take long to achieve. Despite being on separate teams, Li agreed. As the sole Chinese national and participant, Li stressed how Confucian principles continue to underpin the will of Chinese society which has been central to China\u2019s continued desire for a peaceful rise and their tradition of controlling their immediate periphery. Li also claimed that China has made great political strides in terms of opening up their governance structures and enabling greater citizen voice whether through the number of permissible protests or what has been allowed through social media. 3 of the 4 scholars also laid to rest the notion that China\u2019s external procurement policies have been overtly exploitive, arguing instead, that in most cases, international business agreements have been collaborative and based on mutual benefit relative to each country\u2019s stage of development.Essentially, 3 of the 4 scholars suggested that China is stabilizing and has been civil relative to its rise accordingly. Kissinger felt Chinese hegemony would require a welcome spread of China\u2019s \u201csoft power\u201d attributes but given how their language is neither Germanic or Romantic, how they are far less open to the dynamism that characterizes the United States, and how they preserve the interests of the collective over the individual, few countries will embrace their way of life. When compared with the other Munk Debates, this debate read more like a discussion. Ferguson was more of an outlier with his fear mongering, but there was general agreement in most cases. 4 out of 5 stars for this Munk Debate! ",
            "China doesn't have the political capacity to claim leadership responsibility world wide. Even though, it's economy has been in a quite a rise the last ten years, there are massive inefficiencies built into the Chinese economic system. They have a huge property bubble. Their growth is highly inefficient. So it is a quality problem in terms of the economic growth and foreign direct investment. Also, one very important factor is the uncertainty of dealing with the rising middle class in China. How it is going to affect the balance of the economic and political stability of the Chinese system. ",
            "This debate was conducted in Canada sometime during 2011 as part of The Munk Debates. Since I've already read almost every book by Niall Ferguson (most recently Civilization: The West and the Rest) and On China by Henry Kissinger, I felt I was rather familiar with their views on China, and so, I was more interested in the views of David Li and Fareed Zakaria.Very quickly I came to realize that this debate is not only about China, but also to a large extent on the fragile situation of the United States, which can determine whether China will dominate the 21st century. As was expected, Ferguson, who argued the pro, put the emphasis on the declining state of the U.S. economy and the growing economic power of the Chinese.David Li (also arguing the pro), took the Chinese official view that says that we in the West are thinking in wrong terms. It's not a question of whether the 21st century will belong to China, because China is not interested in dominating the world. As a society shaped by Confucius, China is mainly interested in solving its domestic problems and is far less interested in intervening in other countries' businesses. In David Li's words, it's just not in China's DNA. Thus, the entire notion of the debate is flawed in the first place.Kissinger in my opinion was a lot less coherent than the rest of the debaters, mostly arguing that China will gain influence, however, it will not dominate the 21st century. The world will be more multi-polar.Fareed Zakaria had the most convincing arguments, stating the fragile state of the Chinese political system, the growing inequality between the rich and the poor, the lack of freedom of speech, the real estate bubble, and the inefficient growth in China. Therefore, China's growth will be a lot less smooth than most people realize. However, in my opinion, Zakaria downplayed the severity of the U.S. economic situation and how it will affect the military and economic influence of the U.S.To sum up, a lot of interesting insights can be gained from this debate, and it's highly recommended to people who are interested to know what these great thinkers have to say about where China is heading to.",
            "An extremely insightful debate on the future of China and the next century. Both sides make a very compelling case. My only problem is with Economist David Li he relies way to heavily on drawing from experience without backing it up with many statistics. Definitely read this its a solid 8.75/10",
            "Probably the most polite of all Munk Debates with the least amount of argument. Great points made by all parties and a rare public appearance by Kissinger.",
            "Fantastic read after a decade of the debate, and I also watch the debate on YouTube."

Initially, many white soldiers doubted their bravery and skill; they were soon proved wrong.,The Civil War battlefields bore witness to countless acts of courage from the United States Colored Troops, most famously the battle of Fort Wagner where the 54th Massachusetts marched forth and scaled the parapets, only to be driven back in fierce hand-to-hand combat, and the battle of Honey Springs where lines of African American troops advanced regardless of deadly enemy fire and succeeded in repelling the Confederates. African Americans were even conscripted into the Confederate Army towards the war's end to plug the damaging shortages of manpower. ,African American troops comprised 10 percent of the Union Army and approximately one-third of those men lost their lives on the field of battle.,Through fascinating first-hand accounts, this title examines the journey of the African American from slave to soldier to free man, ultimately providing a fascinating insight into the impact that these brave men had on the war and how it influenced their lives thereafter.",

            "It reads a bit like an extended wiki entry but that's exactly what I was looking for. I wanted to read a book that gave a general overview of the subject matter while highlighting areas of interest that I could delve into through other, more focused, works. The direct quotes and photographs helped to give texture to the stories and I appreciated the timeline. I gathered some new to me facts, there was a reverse Underground Railroad to bring African Americans back from Canada so that they could enlist (I want to read up on this). The Peace Democrats weren't very helpful. Many of the solders, at the time of enlistment, either got a last name for the first time or dropped their owners last name and took a new one, both frequently adopting the last name of a Union military leader. (This could be helpful for genealogy research) and found new examples of old facts. Over all, a great short (2hrs) read. ",
            "This is a study of the African Americans who served as soldiers in the Civil War. The author discusses how the soldiers were outfitted, their rations, their duties and numerous other issues of their service. I discovered this book at the library and decided to read it because I have very little information about the Aftrican American soldiers in the Civil War. A very informative read. "

            "An early work from the father of the modern espionage thriller, and it contains my biggest pet peeve: a protagonist doing something incredibly stupid. And it\u2019s okay. Peter Miller is a reporter, not a trained undercover agent. Through the convergence of bad luck, laziness, entitlement, and not truly believing all the precautions taught to him were necessary, he blows his cover almost immediately. The story never really hinged on this anyway. It\u2019s about how the diary of a Holocaust survivor who killed himself leads to the investigation of The ODESSA, a real-life Nazi organization that used stolen wealth to further their twisted philosophies. To varying degrees Forsyth always used fiction to expose reality. He is always entertaining while doing so."

            "Set in the early 1960's in West Germany with some scenes from Israel and Nasserite Egypt , this electrifying book has all the elements of a good historical spy novel - suspense,danger,action,human drama as well as a lot of food for thought.We come across a lot of interesting real figures from the time such as Nazi-hunter Simon Wiesenthal and the head head of MOSSAD Meir Amit as well the evil psycopathic SS Officer Eduard Roschmann who in the novel is hunted by a young German journalist , Peter Miller We also read about statesmen and nation builders at the time such as West German Chancellors Konrad Adenauer and Ludwig Erhardt , Israeli leaders David Ben-Gurion , Levi Eshkol and Golda Meir as well the warlike Egyptian dictator Gamel Abdel Nasser.The novel itself begins with the news of the assasination of John F Kennedy But the ordinary grassroots characters too are equally believable from Millers simple but good hearted and beautiful girlfriend Sigrid Rahn to the Israeli agent Uri Ben Shaul alias Josef to doctors and nurses,civil servants ,secretaries and housemaids. The novel is largely based on a true story and includes several important lessons from history.It lays bare the satanic evil of the Nazi SS while also oulining that ordinary Germans are good people ,as described in the novel by excerpts from the diary of holocaust survivor Salomon Tauber which is a very instructive and insightful piece in itself.It also shows the high level of cooperation between Nazi exiles and Arab states in their evil plans to destroy the tiny state of Israel The attempt to do so still continues today and should be exposed for what it is -naked anti-semitism and hatred.",
            "ODESSA File shows us a very dark and brutal side of humanity. Although I do not know a single Jew, I have wept over and prayed for the millions of Jews killed during the Second World War. I have heard arguments that the Holocaust is just another \u2018casualty\u2019 of War. It is amazing that despite a full fledged war raging all around the world, the Germans had the time, the patience, the resources and the desire to annihilate millions of men, women and children. What is chilling about the Holocaust is the cold precision with which the SS and Gestapo hunted and rounded up the Jews and other \u2018undesirables\u2019 and murdered them or in their words, 'exterminated them' as one would vermin and other pests . Every aspect of the annihilation was planned meticulously, from the rounding up to the extermination in gas chambers or crematoria. When you think that it is people going to such lengths to murder their own friends and neighbors your mind does a blank, it refuses to think, to accept that there can exist such people. But sadly they do. What is even more amazing is that there were people who also went to a great deal of trouble to hide, help and aid the Jews or 'undesirables' their friends. What gives simple men this tremendous courage knowing if they were caught, a certain death awaited them.What is amazing too is the trouble, countries and friends went succor the Nazis when they were fleeing Germany at the end of the War. We do know that the Nazis were accepted with open arms in many Latin American countries.Were these leaders so compassionate? Was greed that motivated them? Do we all have a price? If and when we take a good look at the Holocaust, read about it, maybe put ourselves in the shoes of the victims, difficult but yes, in the shoes of the perpetrators, we are faced with a host of questions that we should ask ourselves. A holocaust victim once asked unable to comprehend the enormity of what had happened to his family, friends, neighbours \u201cWhere was God?\u201d And he got a reply \u201cWhere was Man?\u201dJust today, my friend Lilo wrote:'But don't forget: Not all Germans were Nazis. And once Hitler was in power, non-Nazis were totally helpless. It took Hitler only a few weeks to turn Germany into a bomb-tight police state. And once this was accomplished, every opposition or dissent was equivalent to suicide.'And I reply with great humility,Yes Lilo, I agree. What do I know of being so frightened, so frightened that I cannot think straight, let alone stand up to the might of Adolf Hitler and the Nazis, but through all that, despite being frightened out of their minds, despite being in grave danger, terrible danger to their own lives, many Germans did save Jews. There are no words for such heroism.Thank you Lilo, for showing me another angle.",
            "After the formidable tour de force of The day of the Jackal Forsyth returns with his The ODESSA file (Organisation Der Ehemaligen SS-Angehorigen). And it is a brilliant thriller about a post WWII German journalist his gets his hands on a diary of a Jewish man that survived the horrors of Riga. And if you knew never anything about some of the horrible crimes committed during the last great war you find out galore of the crimes committed by the Nazis especially by those of the SS.The book sets Peter Miller out on a search for the commanding officer of the Riga death-camp and as only Forsyth can write it we find out how difficult it is in even a post WWII Germany to find out about war crimes. Even I as a kid was somewhat surprised while playing with German kids when I was younger about the collective guilt that was still carried by the German people (this was the early seventies).We meet some once famous people like Simon Wiesenthal who explain about the SS excesses and how they organised to disappear before the war was over and how the Wehrmacht was used to win time at the losing end of the war for the SS to lose themselves sometimes even in plain sight.This thriller set in a post WWII Germany resembles a nightmare of the variety of sheer unbelievably reality. I was always surprised how few big and responsible Nazi bigwigs were actually brought before a court of law. This book goes some way explaining it.The thriller aspect of the book was very well done and puts you on the edge of your seat. The motivation of the main character is revealed at the end, which is why I subtracted one star as I figured it out quite early on in the tale and it took some away from the thriller aspect.The sideshow about the rockets in Egypt, influential former Nazis still at large in Germany and the Israeli secret service made this a brilliant thriller that was difficult to stop reading. So I finished it in one long and way to warm summer day (37 degrees Celsius in the shade).This was one of the early Forsyths' I never got to read when I was younger with me buying a set of the three early Forsyths' in hardcover it was bound to be the first one to be read as I had never done so before.Forsyth is perhaps one of the better thriller writers of this era and well worth a reading if you have not done so before. The story he weaves are full of scary details and yet very well written and difficult to stop to read once you have started it.",
            "Hunting Nazis, particularly SS Nazis, still had some cachet when The Odessa File was written in 1972 and the deeds of famous Nazi hunter, Simon Wiesenthal, who had aided the Mossad division of the Israeli Secret Service in identifying and capturing Adolph Eichmann only twelve years earlier, were in the news quite regularly.I read The Odessa File years ago, in the seventies, after reading Day of the Jackal. Remembering recently that I had enjoyed The Odessa File, I decided to read it again. It was an ok second read, but I think maybe my memories of films I saw, books I read, parties I attended, forty and fifty years ago have dimmed somewhat, but at least I still have them! 2 stars - just.",
            "This book struck me as rather similar to 'The Day of the Jackal'. They were international thrillers that made a few tweaks to history to serve an exciting new history and encompassed a wide range of characters. However, where 'The Day of the Jackal' failed because I had already seen the movie, my ignorance of this movie helped keep the book's tension ratcheted up. And really, that is the most appealing part of this book: the tension. What plans will go awry, how will small, seemingly insignificant, events impact the much greater flow of history, who will live or die kept me heavily engaged with the story. In 'The Day of the Jackal' these questions had already been answered for me because of the movies. In this case I was genuinely concerned that at any point the the alleged protagonist could be killed and one of the other characters would pick up where he left off. Really riveting stuff.So where 'The Day of the Jackal' took a historical counterfactual with events immediately after an attempted assassination of French president Charles De Gaulle 'The Odessa File' decides to follow a counterfactual of the existence of an international organization, Odessa, dedicated to protecting and enriching former Nazi SS members. I say counter factual because, while many former Nazis were certainly aided in fleeing Europe post war, it is unlikely there was one overarching organization that did all of it. The story follows a young German journalist who stumbles across an account of a recently deceased Jewish concentration camp survivor who was convinced his camp's overseer (who was responsible for tens of thousands of deaths) was still alive and prospering in post-war 1960's Germany. Thus starts a hunt for Odessa that has significant repercussions on the international stage all nicely folded into the flow of actual history.What I really enjoyed about this book is how every character had their own motivations and pursued them. Even people on ostensibly the same side had their own agendas and were more than happy to use their erstwhile allies to achieve them even if that meant screwing said allies over or getting them killed. It was also refreshing to see the bad guys actually be competent but also constrained by circumstances. These were all not powerful Nazis who turn out to be incompetent (you've got to have some smarts to outlast the Kennedy administration while being hunted internaitonally) but rather a highly organized network of fanatics who faced the same sort of technological and informational constraints a everyone else. It was a pretty even match-up throughout the book which nicely contributed to the book's tension. The use of multiple characters, points of view was also deftly utilized to give the reader a greater context for the events of the book and raise the stakes above the simple hunt for an ex-Nazi officer. It was great to see why all these myriad characters were acting as they did and it really enriched the story.While there were a lot of characters there wasn't really a ton of characterization. Like 'The Day of the Jackal' Forsyth gave plenty of background history to the important characters he introduced, but apart from the Journalist we don't really get a deep dive on any other characters. This is fine by me because the suspense of the story kept me turning pages instead of the characters and the Journalist pulled enough character development weight to carry that aspect of the story. This is a great read for anyone who enjoys thrillers, historical fiction, or WWII history. I have a feeling that, if 'The Day of the Jackal' is any guide, seeing the movie ahead of time will significantly degrade the experience, so read the book first."

            "\u201cIo, signor Aramburu , per i motivi che lei conosce, da bambino ho trascorso nove anni da alcuni miei parenti di San Sebasti\u00e1n\u201d.Cos\u00ec inizia Anni lenti, libro che sar\u00e0 sempre ricordato come l\u2019anticipazione di Patria, ma che, scritto sei anni prima, \u00e8 un romanzo a s\u00e9 stante e, pur trattando gli stessi temi, molto diverso dal ponderoso romanzo che ha meritatamente vinto lo Strega europeo.Chi narra \u00e8 Txiki, che all\u2019epoca dei fatti aveva otto anni e, ora adulto, riassume per lo scrittore il tempo trascorso a casa degli zii e soprattutto in camera con il cugino Julen, indottrinato ai valori nazionalisti dal prete del paese. Siamo negli anni Sessanta, in un tempo apparentemente immobile, dominato dalla dittatura di Franco, di cui ci viene offerto un significativo ritratto in questo cameo: \u201cVedemmo Franco passare tra ovazioni e applausi, con l\u2019uniforme bianca della marina e gli occhiali scuri, in piedi in una macchina nera, salutando un po\u2019 da un lato e un po\u2019 dall\u2019altro con movimenti accennati della mano molle. Sul sedile posteriore, magra e sorridente con quel rictus da teschio che aveva, c\u2019era la sua signora, con un vestito stampato e un opulento mazzo di fiori in grembo, omaggio degli adulatori locali.\u201d\u00c8 il tempo in cui l\u2019ETA comincia la lotta armata e il giovane Julen, imbevuto di retorica che oggi chiameremmo fondamentalista, si arruola in una banda: scelta impulsiva e temeraria, di cui non pu\u00f2 comprendere la portata. Il rapporto tra i due cugini intanto cresce e si consolida, la volitiva madre, il debole padre, la sorella ossessionata dai maschi, il parroco intento a far proseliti sono i personaggi che il lettore incontra in questo viaggio, un tratto di vita breve e significativo, dove ogni scelta \u00e8 gravida di amare conseguenze.Ma non \u00e8 il registro drammatico la scelta dell\u2019autore, in questo caso, al contrario di Patria. Il tocco geniale \u00e8 avere inframezzato al racconto una serie di appunti, che rappresentano il laboratorio dello scrittore, i suoi progetti, le sue ipotesi, i suoi dubbi e le possibili soluzioni narrative... In realt\u00e0 la storia ci viene raccontata anche cos\u00ec, come un soliloquio dell\u2019autore con se stesso, intriso di ironia, autoironia, e dunque di puro divertimento per chi legge (meritandosi cos\u00ec la quinta stella).E qui, Aramburu, giocando un po\u2019, ci mostra esplicitamente a quale legge si assoggetta chi scrive:\u201cPrima la letteratura, poi, se rimane spazio, la verit\u00e0.\u201d",
            "Quasi PatriaL\u201911 novembre dello scorso anno mio fratello mi invia su WhatsApp una lista di romanzi che vorrebbe leggere, chiedendomi se \u00e8 possibile trovarli in ebook.Lo so, non si fa, ma si fa.Nell\u2019elenco, fra gli altri, c\u2019\u00e8 Patria di Fernando Aramburu, che non ho mai sentito nominare.Nel giro di pochi mesi iniziano a comparire i primi timidi, ma entusiasti commenti, forse, addirittura, qualcuno di cui mi fido me lo raccomanda, cos\u00ec incappo in quello che all\u2019epoca era il commento pi\u00f9 votato su Goodreads, in spagnolo, che lo stroncava, argomentando in lungo e in largo senza possibilit\u00e0 di appello (e non lo trovo pi\u00f9, accidenti) le motivazioni di tale posizione- mi aiuto a leggerlo grazie al sempre-santo Google Translate - ed \u00e8 convincente a tal punto che lo invio a mio fratello stesso e a un\u2019amica anobiiana che parla lo spagnolo e ha iniziato, entusiasta anche lei, la lettura di Patria.Poi inizia il passaparola e la lettura da parte di molti dei miei contatti che, chi pi\u00f9 chi meno, iniziano a parlare di capolavoro, cui si aggiunge, ciliegina sulla torta l\u2019assegnazione del Premio Strega Europeo (premio in cui credo, \u00e7a va sans dire, visto che la prima edizione fu vinta con Gli anni da Annie Ernaux).Continuo a nutrire diffidenza nei confronti di Patria, nonostante un amico lettore fidato me ne abbia parlato nuovamente giusto due giorni fa, nonostante nel frattempo anche mio fratello, quest\u2019estate lo abbia a sua volta letto (si sente un po\u2019 il padrino di questo romanzo, e nella mia cerchia di conoscenze, come dargli torto?) e mi abbia confermato il giudizio di tutti gli altri. Cos\u00ec, qualche giorno fa, gli dico che per vincere il mio istinto (ah, il mese scorso l\u2019avevo addirittura proposto al gruppo di lettura, ma nel derby spagnolo Mar\u00edas ha avuto la meglio, cos\u00ec ora mi devo immolare e leggere Berta Isla - che, quasi quasi riconsidero Aramburu) intendo iniziare la manovra di avvicinamento e leggere Anni Lenti, che pi\u00f9 d\u2019uno mi ha detto essere in qualche modo lavoro preparatorio a Patria, che non ha il suo respiro ma gi\u00e0 si vede la stoffa dell\u2019autore, che \u00e8 fresco, ma non leggero\u2026 Mi risponde, sempre in chat: \u201cMa \u00e8 una sciocchezza, \u00e8 come se di Pino Daniele decidessi di ascoltare Ogni scarrafone\u201d, e poi, quando gli ho detto a lettura conclusa \u201ccos\u00ec cos\u00ec\u201d, mi ha risposto \u201cAnni Lenti te lo meriti\u201d.Ecco, me lo sono meritato, anche se non \u00e8 che mi sia dispiaciuto al punto da trovarlo brutto, questo no, \u00e8 solo che mi aspettavo di pi\u00f9, mi aspettavo pi\u00f9 sostanza, e invece ne ho trovata poca, ho trovato una narrazione ancora in fase embrionale.La storia promette molto, ma resta tutto in superficie, i personaggi ci sono, ma non vengono approfonditi perch\u00e9 (come scrive negli appunti dell\u2019autore) non bisogna divagare nella descrizione dei personaggi secondari se non quando sono funzionali alla vicenda centrale - quella di Julen, il cugino del testimone pi\u00f9 che oculare, auricolare, degli eventi, affiliato all\u2019ETA - che resta per\u00f2 nebulosa, raccontata nella sua interezza nemmeno a posteriori.Ma tutto questo, forse, non sarebbe stato nulla, se non fosse che a non piacermi - anzi, a tratti persino a infastidirmi - \u00e8 stato il continuo ammiccamento di Aramburu al lettore, il suo tentativo - mediante gli appunti con cui l\u2019autore intermezza la storia, ma anche nel tono con cui il testimone si rivolge allo stesso - di risultare simpatico, complice, furbacchione, titubante e ingenuo allo stesso tempo.Se penso un altro tentativo del genere, a uno scrittore che gioca con il suo lettore e che lo stordisce con le sue funamboliche piroette, narrando di politica e scrittura, non posso fare a meno di pensare al peruviano naturalizzato spagnolo Mario Vargas Llosa e al suo La zia Julia e lo scribacchino. Ecco, nemmeno per una pagina, nemmeno per una riga, ho mai avuto la sensazione di artificiosit\u00e0, nemmeno quando era palese che si stesse prendendo gioco di me, cosa che invece, Anni Lenti, mi ha suscitato quasi subito.E quindi, per il momento, contatto non stabilito, manovra di avvicinamento non riuscita, ci si riprover\u00e0 pi\u00f9 avanti, quando il mio pregiudizio comincer\u00e0 nuovamente a scemare, perch\u00e9 motivi di interesse ne ho trovati e spunti interessanti anche, e la curiosit\u00e0 di vedere come \u00e8 maturato stilisticamente e strutturalmente Aramburu ora c\u2019\u00e8.\u00abHo l\u2019impressione che oggi un minuto duri trenta o quaranta secondi, i minuti della dittatura, invece, duravano un minuto e mezzo due.\u00bb",
            "La letteratura e il farmacista Allora: la trama non si dice, ma ha a che fare con i primi sviluppi eclatanti del nazionalismo basco.E ha al centro almeno due fatti traumatici. Eppure suona tutt'altro che tragico o deprimente. Perch\u00e9?Il libro si presenta nettamente suddiviso in due parti parallele, che continuano ad alternarsi in modo regolare: i capitoli con un titolo sono raccontati da un testimone-protagonista degli eventi, un bambino-ragazzino mandato a vivere dagli zii a San Sebasti\u00e1n (solo alla fine si espliciter\u00e0 che nel presente \u00e8 un farmacista), a uno scrittore (che poi si esplicita essere l'autore: \u00absi fidi di me, signor Aramburu\u00bb...), il quale sta preparando un romanzo ed \u00e8 comunque uno del posto, che forse pu\u00f2 da s\u00e9 ricordare alcuni degli avvenimenti pi\u00f9 pubblici, le chiacchiere... A questi capitoli dispari si accostano vari Appunti, numerati da 1 a 39: briciole di preparazione del romanzo che, in senso stretto, non verr\u00e0 mai scritto: parentesi, abbozzi, dubbi, alternative possibili, decisioni rimandate. Insomma il libro si presenta come una esibizione ben distinta delle componenti che vengono fuse in un romanzo \u201cnormale\u201d: informazioni risultate da ricerche e colloqui, da una parte, e dall\u2019altra, non agitate e mescolate, le aggiunte, le variazioni, la \u201cscrittura\u201d dell\u2019autore.Il tempo delle vicende all\u2019inizio non \u00e8 dichiarato esplicitamente, ma si capisce subito che gli \u201canni lenti\u201d del titolo sono quelli della Spagna \u201csonnolenta\u201d degli ultimi anni della dittatura di Franco, poi si esplicita: soprattutto 1968 e 1969, con qualche punta nei primi anni Settanta. Anni lenti prima che succeda davvero qualcosa di stravolgente, esplosivo nella lotta dei baschi, ma pi\u00f9 in generale sensazione di essere un po\u2019 ai margini rispetto al fluire storico del resto d\u2019Europa. Franchismo tardo come dittatura sonnolenta, brutale ma in modo abitudinario e senza veri estremi. E and\u00f2 in questo modo. E successe che. Il narratore non \u00e8 inattendibile ma naturalmente parziale: era un bambino al momento degli eventi, capiva e non capiva, diverse cose non le sa proprio, pu\u00f2 soltanto ipotizzare: i due nodi tragici principali alla fine emergono con certezza, ma rimane sempre almeno un alone di dubbio, di imprecisione, una impossibilit\u00e0 di dimostrare o ricostruire fino in fondo.L\u2019origine intima, la motivazione del libro nel suo insieme sembra rivelarsi verso la fine in un ricordo personale di Aramburu: non aver salutato, nell'adolescenza, uno dei personaggi stigmatizzato dalla societ\u00e0 come padre di un traditore. Tutte le ricerche, lo sforzo del racconto, gli scrupoli stilistici potrebbero avere allora un qualche carattere di espiazione: la volont\u00e0 di ovviare al piccolo torto compiuto allora per conformismo, per assenza di empatia. Un'origine che potremmo quindi, simbolicamente, ampliare a un\u2019idea di letteratura come piccolo riscatto delle vite infelici, dei dimenticati, dei vessati: tutti i personaggi in fondo sono sconfitti dalla vita, e anche se ciascuno di loro \u00e8 in qualche modo colpevole, sono anche certamente delle vittime.Come lettore, non trovo per\u00f2 piena connessione emotiva tra questa possibile urgenza di operare una \u201ccorrezione\u201d e l\u2019esibizione di un mestiere, in modo a volte scostante, di chi deve scrivere perch\u00e9 \u00e8 uno scrittore, fa le ricerche perch\u00e9 deve scrivere, persino a volte con una punta di antipatia verso lo stesso testimone (\u00abIl mio informatore, che a volte mi esaspera con la sua smemoratezza e le sue imprecisioni\u00bb), che mi risulta per\u00f2 pi\u00f9 simpatico dell\u2019autore. Sar\u00e0 allora questo l\u2019artificio estremo? Mostrarsi leggermente antipatico e freddo per creare un migliore efficace contrasto con la voce interna, del bambino poverissimo diventato orgogliosamente farmacista, che sta l\u00ec a faticare per far riemergere i ricordi?\u00abNon si rida, compagni, non si ridadel poeta commesso farmacista\u00bb(Guido Gozzano)",
            "Prima la letteratura, poi, se rimane spazio, la verit\u00e0.Un curioso impasto quello che ha scelto Aramburu per Anni Lenti.Una storia, ambientata a San Sebastian, come il ben pi\u00f9 ponderoso Patria, qui associata all'espediente narrativo della testimonianza diretta all'autore. Chi racconta \u00e8 un infatti un uomo che all'epoca dei fatti narrati \u00e8 un bimbo di 8 anni. Egli racconta ad Aramburu, tramite lettere, la storia della famiglia degli zii di cui \u00e8 stato ospite nel 1969 e dintorni.Qui, come in Patria, sono le donne a farla da padrone. Donne tremende ma raccontate con una concretezza che non finisce di lasciarmi stupefatta. Ma la scelta davvero geniale che fa Aramburu in questa opera \u00e8 quella di inframmezzare il racconto con le sue divertenti annotazioni. I dubbi, le idee, le battute, i pensieri e le soluzioni da mettere in campo per proseguire il racconto.Scanzonato e molto ironico Aramburu risulta spassoso, e, nonostante si ponga tra il lettore e la storia, non fa perdere di mordente e spessore ai personaggi, che mantengono comunque una idea di autenticit\u00e0. Idea appunto, perch\u00e9, come ci ricorda negli appunti, l'obiettivo dello scrittore non \u00e8 la cronaca dei fatti ma il riuscire coi fatti a fare letteratura.Appunto 39Nessun mio romanzo senza un episodio al cimitero. Forse era questa la spintarella che mi mancava. Allora, \u00e8 deciso. Domani, dal dentista. Gioved\u00ec, dopo colazione, i primi colpi sui tasti. Se vedo che la storia scorre, che si lascia raccontare, che vuole essere raccontata, le dedicher\u00f2 tutto il mese. E, come al solito, se arrivo a pagina cinquanta non si torna indietro.Sicuramente Patria \u00e8 molto pi\u00f9 maturo e compiuto, ma qui, c'\u00e8 una vena ironica ed autoironica che rende la lettura fresca, nonostante i temi trattati siano assolutamente seri.Si scopre cio\u00e8 che il nostro Aramburu \u00e8 proprio un simpatico scherzone.PS. Anche qui ETA ed Euskera. E un parroco terribile."

            "Re Beyond Reach - Sandra Field brings us the first book of a three book mini-series Significant Others in April 1996's HPlandia.The first two books feature the same couple, an event that hasn't happened since Janet Dailey's 1970's HP outings No Quarter Asked and For Bitter or Worse featuring Cord and Stacy.BR features the beginning of the relationship between Troy, a big blonde burly guy skippering a chartered yacht around the British Virgin Islands when the story starts and Lucy, a Canadian massage therapist who decided to have a little island escape to plan a change of life.Lucy is 25 and comes from an all female family of very determined and assertive medical doctors. Lucy is not the MD type, where her sisters and her mother are all business, Lucy likes to emote and she is very impetuous.It is that impetuosity that led her to answer a newspaper add for a man on the island needing a massage therapist. Except what the guy really wanted was a traveling tart. So when we first meet Lucy, she has recently dropped a very pricey jade figurine and crawled out a window to escape Mr. Advertising Under False Pretenses Guy and she is asking Troy about a job.Troy needs a cook, first mate and deckhand and Lucy manages to convince him she will be great for the job. Troy has his doubts, but Lucy is a good sailor and she manages to cook a pretty nice gourmet dinner for Troy and one of his friends - tho Troy lets her stock up on gourmet deli foods for the actual chartered cruises.It takes Lucy four days to fall in love with Troy, which is remarkable because Troy is SF's usual enigmatic and emotionally unavailable male. But in between the Troy and Lucy arguments, the British Virgin Island sightseeing and Lucy reheating gourmet deli foods, there is a lot of roofie kissing going on.There is also some entertaining couples who charter the yacht. The first pair are newlyweds and Troy and Lucy's Lurve Force Mojo meter rises as the honeymooner's manage to turn the yacht into a floating bordello.The next group is a family with a very distant father, a disgruntled teen daughter and son and pretty nice mother who is at the end of her rope and maybe her marriage. SF uses the family to demonstrate that Lucy is all about feelings and exploring them and that Troy is distant and withdrawn.We soon learn that Troy is really a plastic surgeon on vacation and helping out a friend and that he has some dark trauma in his life. Lucy is determined to sort her going nowhere path out and hopefully bully Troy into loving her back.There is Lucy pushing Troy into emoting, Lucy realizing that her thing for big burly blonde guys is based on the fact that her big burly blonde father died when she was three and she has been looking for his replacement ever since and finally Lucy and Troy helping the disconnected family reconnect and emotionally renew their family ties.Then we have a visit to Troy's family island villa and the big lurve club event explodes. But as soon as the passion has simmered down, Troy is back to being distant. We get a hint that his distance involves some grief over a loss when Troy thinks Lucy is dead while she is watching a lizard do a mating dance in a hammock.Lucy doesn't like Troy distancing himself. Her motto is that since she loves him, he should be loving her back and Lucy is really persistent in trying to dig deep into Troy's psyche. When the last charter group arrives and Troy seems to fixate on the young adult blonde daughter, we finally learn Troy's dark seekrit.Six months earlier, Troy's flute playing, pretty, petite blonde sister went to a convenience store and was shot during a robbery attempt. Troy and his parents fell apart and now Troy is trying to heal his bleeding, grieving heart and find a way to move on. Lucy isn't content with that tho, she has to push and push Troy to respond to her in more than just a physical comfort kinda way and that leads to some very tense moments as they both also have to keep crewing the yacht for the charter.Then Lucy's mother calls and the normally cool and collected lady is an emotional wreck. Lucy's middle sister Cat got into a bad car accident and Lucy is needed at home ASAP. So Troy rushes Lucy to the airport and tries to get her to give him her contact info.But Lucy is in a sulk and writes a mean note saying that Troy is an obstructive wall instead and then she goes home. Troy doesn't give up tho, he hunts Lucy down via his medical contacts and wins over Lucy's sisters and her mother.Cat is in recovery and Lucy and her mother have emotionally reconnected when Troy finally shows up. He declares big' I Love You's' to Lucy, who had been doing the HP Mopey Moment while also being emotionally supportive to her mother and sisters.Since most of what Lucy was moping about was being in love with Troy when he did not love her back, Troy's announcement quickly cheers Lucy up and with big expressions of Purple Passion, Lucy and Troy decide to get married and move to the Canadian Coast for the big HEA. This one is okay, tho Lucy is much more aggressive in her pursuit of Troy than the average HP h. Troy plays the coy unicorn groomer type in this - tho he is definitely NOT hanging out in the rainbow unicorn stables. Overall it is a nice HP Virgin Islands adventure and not a bad way to hang out in the HP office. The next book in the series Second Honeymoon, will be in our HPlandia August 1996 lineup and we will find out what Troy and Lucy have been up to for five years of HP time. Fair warning for the next one, based on the back blurb Troy and Lucy may have some stormy weather ahead...",
            "Idiot heroine takes off for parts unknown to work for a family she has never met to be a live-in masseuse for them. When she shows up, she is SHOCKED that there is no family waiting to be massaged for the summer, just a lecherous old man who thinks masseuse is a euphemism for call-girl.After that great life decision, heroine decides it would be a great idea to get a job as live-in assistant skipper on a yacht working for another man she has never met before.The man is a tall, blond hunk, exactly heroine's type. And he is making googly eyes at her like she is Jessica Rabbit in a red bikini.In between epic fights where they both tell each other they are VERY NOT INTERESTED, they kiss, grope, make out, and finally go to bed together. In their free time, they somehow manage to crew for guests who chartered their boat for a vacation on the high seas. It's a wonder the boat didn't sink!The heroine's epiphany is that she has been looking for her dad, the OG tall, blond hunk of her childhood memories, all her life. But now that one of the yacht's guests gave her a five minute pop psychology diagnosis, she is finally able to exorcise her demons and love the hero for who he is, rather than who he represents.The hero is not psychologically ready to accept the heroine's love because he is still grieving for his murdered sister. Since he has not had the benefit of impromptu, lightning round of pop psychology counseling, he shouts at the heroine to get out of his life.She returns home only to have the contrite hero chase her down with mucho grovel and undying love declarations. After getting his promise that he will never shut her out of his emotions again, heroine accepts his proposal for the HEA ending......which according to reviews of the sequel to this book, Second Honeymoon, is just an HFN ending.I am definitely not interested enough in this tedious couple to trudge through episode two of their unending bickerfest :~{",
            "Despite that very risque cover (I had to look twice to make sure his hand wasn't just covering up the midsection of a dress), this book was incredibly tame. There's a good reason that HP readers get all dreamy about Lynne Graham's heroes, who are, without exception, all insanely crazy in love with the heroine. There's also a reason that I've never heard anyone wax lyrical about Sandra Field's leading men: they're pretty useless in the romance department.Cue the story. Sandra Field has her stories set all over the world, such as The Land of Maybe, which is set on the Faroes Isles. Pretty darn cool. This one takes place aboard a charter sailboat, and the heroine is no stranger to sailing, and the terms ring true. Lucy also has a compelling reason for wanting to sail with Troy Donovan. She sees an employment ad requesting cook/crew member and jumps at the chance. It's no wonder she does so, because her last job opp in this same place has gone up in smoke when her employer turns out to be some sexually-molesting violent mafia-seeming creep. She sees Troy Donovan, who, besides his extremely masculine hero-man name, is also a sex god of tall and blond proportions. They have cute banter, he warns her off having designs on him, she returns with some shots of her own. The book is off to a good start.And then?And then the book fizzles. Because like all other Sandra Field books, the hero is determinedly (or just plain) not interested in the heroine. I found myself frowning and thinking, If this guy were a girl, the guy would definitely be calling her a tease and a slut. Because this guy makes hot eyes at her and then determinedly says NO! to having an affair. Because this guy kisses her hotly and then determinedly says NO! to having an affair. Because this guy rubs her up hotly in her blankets and then leaves her determinedly, having said NO! to having an affair. Seriously, the girl is not even asking for a commitment. She just didn't want to be kicked off the boat and wouldn't mind some extra kissy-face-time with him. Plus, he turns hot and cold with incredible (and unattractive) moodiness. Good grief, dude, she's doing you a freaking favor, working hard as blazes and cooking up a storm.(That was another thing. She was able to suddenly start preparing haute cuisine (like four course meals) having watched her mother entertain dinner guests 10 years ago? That seems...odd. She suddenly was churning out incredible pastries and breads and desserts in this tiny (I'm assuming) galley of a kitchen after two days of shopping when I've had to run out to the store because the recipe called for one ingredient instead of another? Stretching it just a tad. Yes, you can cook by following a recipe, but how many recipes could you follow to the letter without doing substitutions, halving the recipe without sometimes disastrous results, or adjusting for variations in oven temperature or even pan differences? Come ON!)",
            "We'll get along even if it kill us.To Lucy's horror she heard herself say, You mean you'll actually be nice to me?I've never in my life met a woman as contentious as you! Don't you ever let up?I wouldn't be so cranky if you'd act like human being, she retorted, It's because you're so-so unreachable.Unreachable is exactly what I am, and what I intend to remain,' Troy answered grimly. And don't, if you value living, ask why.",

            "Pretty standard realistic fiction stuff dealing with family, friend, and school situations. Appreciated the blended family and twin focus, neither of which you see too often.",
            "Monty has troubles making decisions about the smallest thing. What pet to get, what to name it, what to write his school papers about. He's dealing with a very complicated family life, including both a stepmother AND a stepfather, as well as older and younger step and half siblings, and his twin sister Montana, with whom he squabbles a good deal. When his teacher decides he needs help to stop waffling, she plasters his arm with adhesive bandages that she calls decision aides-- he has to remove one every time he changes he mind, and once he is out of them, he has to stick with his decision. When his fourth grade class gets younger reading buddies, he enjoys working with Leo, but when other students approach him to be their buddies, too, he can't decide which one to choose, so says he will work with them all. Of course, Monty's inability to make decisions eventually catches up with him, and his family must help him with a new approach.Strengths: I imagine there are students out there who struggle with this issue, and the book is very realistic. It would probably be a good read aloud in elementary school.Weaknesses: Monty's rat ALMOST dies by falling in the toilet as the result of Monty's inattention. (Thank you to Ms. Donovan for letting me know I got this wrong at first!)This would be traumatic for a fourth grader to read about, in fact, I will blame my inattention to detail to a severe flashback I had about the near death experience of Gimli the Dwarf Hamster once very fraught Christmas day. I also wondered about whether Leo's mother would really bring a kindergartner to a fourth grader's house for a play date. "

I like the fact that they tested all recipes in a standard and an electric cooker. The cooker they tested and recommended is the one that I own. They usually have a small note by each recipe as to how to adapt it to the electric cooker, but I haven't been having too many problems with my food being overcooked. It happens occasionally, but, as with all of America's Test Kitchen recipes, they are testing and being precise at sea level and that is nowhere near my altitude.I didn't get a chance to make any of these recipes, but I did read all the hints and discussions about the cookers. This is a library copy. I am considering actually purchasing this as it is one of the better pressure cooker cookbooks I have looked at.",

The idea being I either needed to learn to use it and determine it's worth in taking up my kitchen space OR get rid of it. Hard to get rid of an item that is haled as being so handy and never having given it a proper chance.I have made three recipes so far and appreciate how easy to understand and follow the book has been. As American Test Kitchen is behind the book my favorite part is that they have tested several ways of making each recipe and are presenting what they found to be the best way to make the recipe. Also if there are substitutions or alternatives that can be used they show that as part of the recipe sidebar. Totally recommend this book if you too have a pressure cooker gathering dust some where in your home! The pork tacos have been our favorite so far. Incredibly crock pot tender meat in a FRACTION of the time! ,) "

            "The first two stories were very enjoyable, and very much fit into what I consider science fiction. Flatlander was my favorite short story in the book. There was adventure, discovery, danger and a good sense of humor throughout. The Crime and Glory of Commander Suzdal was also a very interesting read that had a decent payoff at the end. The story held tension throughout and the strangeness was entertaining.The rest of the stories were an absolutely awful experience. Overproof started off well, but dragged on, and on, and on. The pages kept turning with entirely pointless scenes, until the author seemed to paint himself into a corner of predictability (and even distastefulness). Poor Planet never, at any point, became interesting. It was a weak premise that served only to criticize propaganda, while at the same time, serve as it's own form of twisted version of the same, apparently unbeknownst to the author.The last 3 stories I had to skim. For some reason, after just sitting through an incredibly weak story involving court systems and espionage, they gave us 3 more of exactly the same thing! I don't know about you, but when I pick up a sci-fi book, I don't want to read 4 short stories about court cases and political/corporate espionage. Each respective story loosely disguised these as science fiction by slapping on some alien identity to a people painfully human. The Frank Herbert story at least attempted to make aliens as different. However, the story just read like an info dump of nonsensical gibberish.I'm glad it's over."

            "When I began this book (loaner from a friend), I admit my eyes rolled back in my head. For the historical parts, Bowers adopts a storytelling style that\u2019s a bit...over the top. He is more interested in telling a story than in providing a historical account\u2014in true religious form, he includes the apocrypha. I cheer for the heroes when they vanquish their oppressors. But I am not sold on the bad guys, who seem to have terribly flimsy motives. And I am interested in the historicity of the characters. Baha\u2019u\u2019llah has kids, a wife, and apparently only one of them wrote anything? Surely the others were equally educated, if not imbued with divine authority? What did they have to say?That is one of the unique things about this particular faith founder: he is absolutely prolific. All the important figures are extremely literate. Even Azal (our bad guy) fights with a believer by taking turns writing angry books. Pure academics, a trend which evidently continues to this day. \u2018Abdu\u2019l-Baha, as a direct consequence of not being God, is generally more comprehensible than his father. But Baha\u2019u\u2019llah has been translated in thees and thous, which gives the impression that someone is trying to endow this religion with an antiquity it doesn\u2019t have. Or maybe it just reflects Baha\u2019u\u2019llah\u2019s flair for the dramatic, which he definitely has.This is a great introduction, and a genuinely inspirational book. There were so many spiritually valuable ideas, new religious language, and new approaches that make the weight of tradition easier to bear. I have renewed ambition for the good life. I have fresh perspective and curiosity. All I wanted was some background info, and I got that too. Highly recommended."

It always presents something of a quandary whether first to read a book from somebody inside the faith or an outsider's view. I liked that fact that the book quoted extensively from the major figures of Baha'i. I am sympathetic to Bah\u00e1'u'll\u00e1h, and he obviously was a very wise man, but I didn't find the constant assertions on the part of the author that he introduced unique religious teachings very convincing. Baha'i just seems like Islam 2.0 to me. (Not that there's anything wrong with that!) I do find it interesting that at practically the same time Christianity 2.0 was being introduced a half a world away by another self proclaimed prophet named Joseph Smith. ",
            "The Baha'i Faith is a world religion that teaches the validity and truth of all other religions, the absolute equality of the sexes, the radical freedom of the human spirit, and the immanent emergence of a global civilization based on justice and compassion. It posits that the purpose of the universe is for humanity to become closer and closer to the divine (and thus acquiring the qualities of godliness), and is intended to foster our eternal evolution by guiding virtuous thought and right action. Why haven't more people heard about this? It's... compelling. The book itself is nothing special. It's a competent presentation, though it would be more helpful if there weren't such gigantic blocks of quotations from historical/literary/scriptural sources. ",

            "Anyone looking for Archetypes to serve up a scoop of Jung or Greek mythos is going to be sorely disappointed. Anyone expecting deep thought about what makes people tick will be equally disappointed. Anyone looking for the kind of no-nonsense straight talk Myss dished out in Why People Don't Heal or Anatomy of Spirit is really going to be disappointed. This book seems to exist primarily as a lead-in to yet another social networking site -- as if the world really needs another one of those -- based on an absurdly superficial archetype test that would make a serious psychology student's head explode. The idea is that you take the (very predictable) test, then set up your very own personal page emblazoned with oh-so-cute graphics to tell the world that you are a mix of X, Y, and Z archetypes. Then, of course, you share with your friends all your interests and life details. In other words, yet another opportunity for you to become some company's data-mining product so they can sell data to advertisers. We all know the routine. I was pretty sure Myss had jumped the shark with Entering the Castle. With this book, she has completely sold out. Either that, or she's being held hostage by someone wanting to use her loyal audience to launch the Next Big Thing in Social Networking. So, why two stars if I thought it such a flagrant marketing ploy? Because, in spite of all that fluffy stuff, Myss manages to include a few meaty bits about how, regardless of how we identify, we are all capable of self-sabotage, and the means of that self-sabotage is often very predictable based on how we identify. (She would say according to our archetype, but it really is self-identification.) Probably the most salient point to the book is that archetypes are not set in stone. As our culture changes, new types emerge and archaic ones fade away. There's been a lot of criticism for Myss calling fashionista a modern archetype. That's not something I really have a problem with. Myss has made a reasonable argument that the pattern of behavior associated with fashionistas is predictable and prevalent enough that I'm willing to go with it. The book is a fast, light read. It's not particularly enlightening, but might be useful to someone who has never read Myss' earlier works or just wants a very fast overview of traits, strengths, weaknesses and shadow side of a handful of modern types. The website, on the other hand, is completely lame. ",
            "In Archetypes Myss provides some interesting broad categories of personality types. She aims her book toward women. The categories make sense and provide some insight concerning what motivates people. She also gives her thoughts on the pitfalls inherent in each orientation as well as what their strengths are.There's nothing terrible or wrong thinking about the book but I think others have provided better information for instance enneagrams especially as outlined by Risso in Personality Types: Using the Enneagram for Self-Discovery give a clearer, more precise picture of personality drives and how they interact with others, what the healthy side of each drive is and the pitfalls. Myss's use of the term archetype feels wrong to me since, in my mind, an archetype denotes a much more esoteric spiritual meaning beyond and independent of a personality type. To sum up there's nothing harmful about Archetypes but there's also nothing tremendously insightful or helpful about it. This review is based on an advanced readers copy supplied by the publisher.(Disclaimer given per FTC requirement.) ",
            "Eh. I don't want to choose my personality type from a list where Fashonista is an option. (Isn't 'Fashonista' the absence of personality - or at the very most a hobby?) Would rather have a more scientific basis. But it may be good for some people who are just starting the journey.For me The Wisdom of the Enneagram: The Complete Guide to Psychological and Spiritual Growth for the Nine Personality Types was more useful/relevant. This is just way too fluffy for me. No real way to choose your type other than choosing based on the Chapter name or reading the entire book.Also it seems like an Advertisement for their website.",

            "Disclaimer: I received an eARC of this book from netgalley.com.Carl Jung defines archetype as an ancient, or archaic image, which derives from the collected unconscious. Archetypes help us identify themes and learn ways to connect to the world around. I'm a tarot reader, and in tarot, archetypes are important. Which is why I was curious to read Archetypes by Caroline Myss. This book introduces the reader to archetypes and how they affect every aspect of our life. Myss describes 10 core families of archetypes and asks the reader to figure out whether or not they self identify with any of these. Rather basic stuff, if you ask me. The core audience for this book are women, as women are the ones who tend to delve deeply into these aspects. However, each archetype has a specific section catering to our male counterparts. I think this does the archetypes a dis-service because they are truly universal and know no gender typing. I also found a few other things Myss says in this book disturbing. In her introduction, she describes a situation where a client was divorced and had cancer. She tries to say that perhaps the disease was not the thing killing her, but her disconnection from her archetype (or mythic influence). Later on, in the section on describing The Visionary archetype, she writes about how she cautions people from receiving personal readings from psychics. That they give bogus information and drain your bank account. This is hypocritical coming from someone who is at the same time teaching women how to use their archetypes to get in touch with their intuitive side.The biggest thing about Archetypes is that the book feels rushed and unfinished. It only introduces the 10 families of archetypes, giving small lists of how to recognize their power and integrate it into our lives. The book mentions being a guide for a business called archetype.me. I dug a bit deeper and found out that this website/company never fully off the ground and is defunct. It doesn't lessen the material in the book but it does make me wonder about the validity of the information. Is this book really useful or just a infomercial to hook women into buying scents or clothing?",
            "Interesting to listen to the author about archetypes and how we can encompass more than one and how our archetypes attract certain other archetypes. Myss talks about generational archetypes. Overall the perspective of archetypes is from one person so if you want to play along you have to imagine for yourself what a fashionista or princess, prince, rebel, visionary, the advocate, the Queen, the intellectual, spiritual, the caregiver, the victim, the savior etc. I will add the note that this is a white woman writing from a white perspective. It\u2019s very clear in not only the examples but the judgements of how the archetypes control, or influence or oppress other archetypes. Mostly it\u2019s her perspective that feels judgmental in this book but not as much in the last two books."

            "This collection of Chopin\u2019s short fiction has been languishing on my shelves for years. I had previously read, and not much cared for, one of the short stories featured here and it inhibited me from eagerly returning to the rest of this author\u2019s work. I decided to space out this book\u2019s contents over the course of a fortnight and am a little sad to say that I am not convinced, after reading them, that Chopin is the author for me.I adored the longest tale collected here, which was the title novella, \u2018The Awakening\u2019. Perhaps the extended page length is what caused me to so fully love this creation, but the rest failed to appeal in anywhere close to the same way. In fact, I found most ultimately proved a little forgettable or pointless, to me. I could appreciate Chopin\u2019s craft in their construction, but the contents and the direction were rarely for me, personally.Here is a breakdown of my ratings for each story:The Awakening - 5/5 starsWiser Than a God - 3/5 starsA Point at Issue! - 3/5 starsThe Christ Light - 3/5 starsThe Maid of Saint Phillippe - 3/5 starsDoctor Chevalier\u2019s Lie - 3/5 starsBeyond the Bayou - 3/5 starsOld Aunt Peggy - 1/5 starsRipe Figs - 2/5 starsMiss McEnders - 3/5 starsAt the \u2018Cadian Ball - 3/5 starsThe Father of Desiree\u2019s Baby - 2/5 starsCaline - 3/5 starsA Matter of Prejudice - 3/5 starsAzelie - 3/5 starsA Lady of Bayou St. John - 3/5 starsLa Belle Zoraide - 3/5 starsTonie - 3/5 starsA Gentleman of Bayou Teche - 3/5 starsIn Sabine - 3/5 starsA Respectable Woman - 4/5 starsThe Dream of an Hour - 3/5 starsLilacs - 4/5 starsRegret - 4/5 starsThe Kiss - 2.5/5 starsHer Letters - 3.5/5 starsAthenaise - 3/5 starsThe Unexpected - /5 starsVagabonds - /5 starsA Pair of Silk Stockings - 3/5 starsAn Egyptian Cigarette - 2.5/5 starsElizabeth Stock\u2019s One Story - /5 starsThe Storm: A Sequel to \u201cThe \u2018Cadain Ball\u201d - 3/5 stars",
            "El p\u00e1jaro que quiere remontarse por encima del nivel ordinario de la tradici\u00f3n y los prejuicios debe tener las alas fuertes.\u2014 Kate Chopin, 'El despertar' \ud83d\udd4aPor desgracia, las alas de Edna Pontellier no fueron lo suficientemente fuertes para sostener sus ansias de libertad e independencia...Todo empieza en la estaci\u00f3n balnearia de Grand Isle, en la costa de Luisiana. Un id\u00edlico lugar de retiro veraniego frecuentado por la buena sociedad criolla de Nueva Orleans. Cuando conocemos a Edna, joven esposa de un acaudalado comerciante y madre de dos ni\u00f1os, su vida parece transcurrir de forma pl\u00e1cida y previsible entre amigos y conocidos de su misma clase. Uno de ellos es Robert Lebrun, un atractivo joven que coquetea inocentemente con las respetables se\u00f1oras de la estaci\u00f3n balnearia. M\u00e1s, en ese verano de finales de siglo, el encuentro entre Edna, Robert y el mar no tendr\u00e1 nada de inocente. Unas sensaciones, hasta ahora desconocidas, har\u00e1n presa de la joven y ser\u00e1n el catalizador de un placentero y a la vez doloroso despertar. No puedo desvelaros m\u00e1s detalles de la trama, porque os estar\u00eda privando del placer de descubrir por vosotros mismos esta bella y delicada novella.Un relato que se abre dulcemente, entre el rumor de las olas, el sonido de un piano y el roce de los vestidos de muselina, para terminar culminando en un grito, largamente contenido. Un grito ahogado que trae consigo el esc\u00e1ndalo y la tragedia. 'El despertar', publicado en 1899, caus\u00f3 gran indignaci\u00f3n en su \u00e9poca y, pese al paso del tiempo, una entiende perfectamente porqu\u00e9. En sus p\u00e1ginas se cuestionan instituciones 'sagradas' por aquel entonces como el matrimonio y la maternidad. En \u00e9l queda expuesta la dif\u00edcil dicotom\u00eda entre la realizaci\u00f3n individual de una mujer y la sumisi\u00f3n a los roles impuestos de esposa y madre.Como bien dice Kate Chopin 'el p\u00e1jaro que quiere alzarse contra la tradici\u00f3n debe tener alas fuertes y resistentes'. La misma autora lo vivi\u00f3 en carne propia y tambi\u00e9n lo har\u00eda Edna, su heroina. \u00bfC\u00f3mo iba a salir airosa la mujer que osa anteponer sus propios deseos al cuidado de sus hijos y a los dictados de su marido? Otros relatos, como el espl\u00e9ndido 'Historia de una hora', en el que la infelicidad en el matrimonio tambi\u00e9n es protagonista, acompa\u00f1an a 'El despertar' en este volumen. En conjunto forman una maravillosa puerta de entrada a aquel mundo de los criollos (descendientes de franceses) que poblaban aldeas y ciudades de Luisiana tras la Guerra de Secesi\u00f3n. Un mundo de costumbres ancestrales y de anhelos frustrados que Kate Chopin recrea con maestr\u00eda. "

            "Forse \u00e8 meglio svegliarsi, dopotutto, anche se per soffrire, piuttosto che rimanere vittima delle illusioni per tutta la vita.Il risveglio \u00e8 un romanzo di Kate Chopin, scrittrice statunitense di origini irlandesi famosa per i suoi romanzi ambientati sullo sfondo della Louisiana creola. Questo \u00e8 probabilmente la sua opera pi\u00f9 famosa ed era nella mia wishlist da moltissimo tempo. La meravigliosa edizione di Storie senza Tempo mi ha dato l'opportunit\u00e0 di recuperarlo. Questo volume poi non contiene solo Il risveglio, ma anche altri brevi racconti dell'autrice, cosa che permette di fare letteralmente un viaggio tra le sue opere di maggior pregio. Il romanzo ha come protagonista Edna Pontellier, una giovane donna sposata e con due bambini. La storia inizia un'estate in Louisiana, tra le cittadine di New Orleans e Grand-Isle. Apparentemente la vita di Edna \u00e8 perfetta, ha un marito che la ama, due bei bambini, una vita agiata e una bella casa. Il risveglio che d\u00e0 il titolo al romanzo \u00e8 per l'appunto il risveglio di Edna, che capisce che quella vita la costringe a sottostare a tutta una serie di regole, di confini, di barriere che la limitano e la rendono in qualche modo prigioniera.Il risveglio di Edna parte dal comprendere che, prima di essere moglie e madre, \u00e8 una donna, un essere pensante dotato di una propria indipendenza. Edna inizia cos\u00ec a liberarsi di quei confini che la intrappolano, inizia a prendere decisioni che mettono in primo piano il suo benessere e non quello degli altri. Le vicende che la vedono protagonista la rendono simile per certi versi ad altri personaggi che si trovano ad affrontare lo stesso risveglio, come le pi\u00f9 famose Emma Bovary e Anna Karenina. Ma il percorso di Edna \u00e8 anche molto diverso, perch\u00e8 la consapevolezza che pian piano acquista arriva in modi inaspettati.Appena pubblicato questo romanzo dest\u00f2 moltissimo scalpore, solo in seguito \u00e8 stato rivalutato ed \u00e8 stato apprezzato come meritava. Il racconto della Chopin viene definito come uno dei primi romanzi femministi. E in effetti, almeno per certi versi, la storia lo \u00e8, cos\u00ec come \u00e8 prettamente femminista la presa di coscienza di Edna. Lo stile del racconto \u00e8 molto scorrevole ed elegante, alcuni passaggi sono davvero bellissimi e lasciano senza fiato. Il ritmo del racconto \u00e8 lento, perch\u00e8 alla fine non succede molto in questo romanzo. Edna \u00e8 protagonista principale e il suo risveglio \u00e8 esso stesso protagonista e tiene banco per le quasi 200 pagine di questa storia. Ho trovato molto interessanti anche i brevi racconti riportati alla fine del volume, credo che aiutino a comprendere meglio l'autrice e a valutare in modo pi\u00f9 completo la sua opera.Devo ammettere che, nonostante la lentezza del racconto e alcuni atteggiamenti della stessa Edna, ho trovato il romanzo molto bello e interessante. Mi \u00e8 piaciuta moltissimo l'ambientazione, che ho trovato particolarmente affascinante, e ovviamente anche l'aspetto psicologico della vicenda, che \u00e8 quello centrale e pi\u00f9 importante. Edna si risveglia, letteralmente, da un sonno profondo che la vede prigioniera, e inizia ad acquistare sempre pi\u00f9 consapevolezza di s\u00e8 stessa, sia fisicamente che mentalmente. Pi\u00f9 che la storia in s\u00e8 o la sua protagonista, quello che colpisce \u00e8 il periodo storico in cui la Chopin lo scrisse, cosa che lo rende davvero avanti con i tempi e quasi rivoluzionario. ",
            "This is a short novel, published in 1899. It caused such a scandal that it was banned for decades afterward. The furor over this book was so upsetting to Kate Chopin that she gave up writing altogether. The story is about Mrs. Edna Pontellier, a Kentucky girl married to Leonce, a New Orleans Creole. One summer, When she is twenty-eight, something inside her starts to shift. She's not fully aware of what's happening, but she knows she feels different. Gradually she stops obeying social conventions and begins to do and say what she wants. Because she's a woman, everyone dismisses it and says, Leave her alone and she'll get over it. But she doesn't. She becomes more and more independent and willful, unwilling to play the game anymore.It's a good read, and paints an interesting picture of New Orleans life and customs of that time. My copy (Bantam Classics) has an intro by Marilynne Robinson that really made me mad! She gives away the conclusion of the story in the second paragraph of the intro! So I read the entire book knowing how it would end, which I never would have guessed on my own. Mad, mad, mad!!! From a modern perspective, it's hard to see what could be scandalous about this story, but it was written in the Victorian age.The book also has a small collection of excellent short stories at the end. As far as storytelling, some of them are almost better than the novel. I especially liked:Beyond the BayouMa'ame PelagieThe Locket "

Occupied by Pompey the Great from 63 BC the region became the Roman province of Iudaea in AD 6. In AD 66 a local disturbance in Caesarea caused by Greeks sacrificing birds in front of a local synagogue exploded into a pan-Jewish revolt against their Roman overlords. Gaining momentum, the rebels successfully occupied Jerusalem and drove off an attack by the Roman legate of Syria, Cestus Gallius, who was defeated at the battle of Beth Horon.,The emperor Nero dispatched the Roman general Vespasian along with reinforcements and, having crushed the revolt in Galilee he became embroiled in the events of the Year of the Four Emperors that would lead to his assumption of the Imperial throne. His son Titus was left to carry on the war which culminated in the dramatic siege of Jerusalem in AD 70. Remorselessly, the legions strangled the life out of the defense street by street, leaving nothing but rubble and ashes in their wake. The apotheosis of the conflict was the final stand of the last holdouts in the Temple precinct itself, and the utter annihilation of this, the physical manifestation of Judaism itself.,The last remnants held out in the mountain fortress of Masada until AD 73 when with the Romans breaking down the walls the defenders committed mass suicide bringing the revolt to an end.",

            " This short book was about the Jewish Revolt against Roman rule which started in AD 66 and ended in AD 74. It explained the course of the war and provided a good deal of relevant background information of not only the leaders, weapons, tactics, and geography of the time, but also explained why they basically 'did what they did.' Like an neglected pot which seems to suddenly go from simmer to boil and overflows all over the place, the Jewish people of antiquity surprised themselves as well as the Romans coming to crush their rebellion. They rose up and caught the Romans on the march, in terrain that favored the lightly armed and poorly led Jews. There the Jewsxa0almost annihilated their enemies. The only thing that saved the remnants of the Roman Legion were the Jewish fighters themselves. xa0xa0xa0 The author explains how the Jewish nation was almost doomed to defeat whereas they might have beaten the Romans had there been a Moses to lead them. Instead they constantly fought amongst themselves vying for power and over religious differences until it was too late. By that time the iniative passed to the Romans and, to quote the author, the Jews handed the Romans a fight on the very grounds they excelled - logistics, supply chains, and the methodical nature of siege warfare.xa0xa0Thexa0Jews sat behind their fortifications which fell onexa0by one, Jerusalem, Masada, etc. until nonexa0was left.xa0 xa0xa0xa0 As a result of the war, they were no longer a nation. and hence the start of the Diaspora. Christ's prophetic words had been fulfilled with a vengeance. This was also the turning point in the rise of Christianity. Warned by Divine Providence to leave Jerusalem before the siege, the followers of Christ survived and were no longer just a dissident sect of Judaism. xa0xa0xa0 A couple of interesting facts were also coveredxa0such asxa0how Josephus, a Jewish war leader of some renown, came to switch sides much like our own Benedict Arnold. This was the same Josephus who's records have been passed down to us and are so frequently referred to by historians.xa0xa0xa0 One of my peeves in books about historical, or even fantasy battles, is whenxa0 the maps do not show places of interest mentioned in the story. That is not the case here. xa0xa0xa0 There are a lot of pictures of Roman coins but there is a reason for this. Cellphones hadn't been invented yet so one has to study these coins to see thexa0'selfies' of the rulers. The images put on the coins were important too. I would have preferred more artwork, which were really great here,xa0but it was a short book. ",
            "As Jews we pray, of course (what? you're not? or you are, but you don't? ), every week and day that the Temple in Jerusalem may be restored and the verdict of destruction of 70 CE may be reversed. But beyond hoping for its ultimate reversal (whether actual or metaphorical), our Rabbinic Jewish account of the actual destruction is thin on details. We are taught that it was brought about by sinat hinam, free flowing hatred between Jews, and by a number of other sins, for which God punished the Jewish people. Indeed, The Jewish Revolt gives ample evidence of the intense factionalism that divided the Jews right up until the moment when the Roman legions appeared on the hills outside of Jerusalem. Sinat hinam- free flowing hatred between brothers - intense political factionalism and civil war - were very likely part of the weakness that made Rome's victory more possible. But the idea that the power of Rome could be resisted, even by the best organized and most socially integrated opponent, is belied by the record. Rome was all but invincible. It had mastered the social and mechanical technologies of war in its time. Whatever we Jews did to bring about the destruction, it had an awful lot to do with a power beyond us... Rome at the very least. As for God's involvement, (the great hand that you sent against us...) I'll leave that for you to decide. I would only point out that if this was indeed God's hand, then the study of the details of Roman military history, logistics, technology and politics becomes a form of Jewish theology, a way of knowing the Creator of all.I originally picked this book up because of a passage I saw quoted that described the logistical challenges of Roman legions, and how the constant need for fodder for pack animals and the carrying capacities of man and beast, defined the pace, timing and strategy of Roman war making. The pages devoted to these matters are indeed very informative. In addition to logistics, The Jewish Revolt chronicles the Roman and Jewish commanders, the opposing armies, the battle plans, and the destruction and horrendous slaughter with which it all concluded. The Jewish forces inflicted considerable casualties on the Romans too, particularly in the early stages of the war. It is a gripping and gory battle story, independent of any theological significance that one may attribute to the destruction of the Temple and termination of the remnants of Jewish sovereignty in the Land of Israel. A campaign of this magnitude would leave a mark on military history at the very least. But it in fact it left at least two great cultural marks as well - Christianity and Rabbinic Judaism both emerged from the ashes, as interpretations of what the Jewish story had meant, and as conscious efforts to keep it alive in a world in which the primary focus of that story, the Temple and the People of Israel living in the Land of Israel had disappeared. If nature abhors a vacuum, it is difficult to imagine a bigger vacuum than that created by Rome in Judea. This is the story of the military operations and political machinations that created a great emptiness in Aretz Yisrael. One million Jews were slaughtered or driven into exile, the land denuded, the religious center destroyed. A civilization all but vanished. Yet a void, a great contraction of this magnitude, an implosion, creates its own waves. Out of that space emerged stories and religions - ways of making meaning that wrestled with the fragments that were left, such as textual compendiums like the Jewish bible, and memories of holy teachers, men called Godly and even men called God, and memories of folk customs and legal traditions. In the blank canvas created by the destruction it was possible to imagine and remember new pasts, and find in them the origin stories of a new future.One of those stories ended up conquering the very empire that had seeded it, when Christianity became the official religion of the Roman Empire under Constantine some 250 years later. Meanwhile, Jewish mourning for the lost reality, and Jewish realization that there was no political or physical space for Jewish nationhood in the world of Rome, led the Rabbis of the Mishna to imagine an idealized neoplatonic Land of Israel and Jewish People, whose rules and customs could be kept alive, and could keep the Jewish people alive even without an actual Temple or Land. And other echos followed. Without a Jewish polity, Arab peoples flowed into and multiplied in the land, creating more recent but, let us fiat, no less deeply felt attachments to the land. Why not accept the verdict of Rome and assume that the Jews were dead forever? And then, onward to the present, and the return of the Jewish people to its land, now the land of others too.For me this book drives home just what a profound world historical event the destruction of the Jewish polity and its temple was. Not only was the Beit HaMikdash one of the grandest structures of the ancient world, but the provinces of Judea constituted a rich and complex civilization, of some one million individuals. Other subject peoples had been willing to pay homage to Rome, and retain their temples and religious practices within the Roman orbit. The Jews rebelled and would not bow. Perhaps they could not bow. Rome's verdict was equally uncompromising. The resulting slaughter and cruelty were executed on a mind-boggling scale. Battles are detailed here with great precision, down to the names of commanders, and the lay of the land as specific legions march through still familiar valleys, as Jewish rebels attack from the hills, and as the Roman armies surround, besiege and ultimately destroy Jerusalem. The illustrations of siege engines and coins, the paintings of battles, and the maps and modern photographs of ruins, all bring home the tactile reality of a turning point, a foundational act of destruction, in Western history.",
            "Another excellent addition to the Campaign series.Si Sheppard gives a clear, but necessarily brief, overview of the 8 year revolt in Judaea that saw the rise of a new Imperial Dynasty and birthed the Colisseum. Following the fraught infighting among the Jews particularly in Jerusalem throughout the whole period is a complex issue and Sheppard makes matters as clear as it is reasonably possible to get.The Jewish Revolt was one of the bloodiest campaigns of the Roman Empire, fought when it was at the zenith of it's glory, and one we are particularly blessed to have an excellent first hand account for, in Flavius Josephus and his Bello Iudaica. Sheppard is necessarily reliant upon him but is not uncritical in his acceptance.Sheppard follows the standard template for this series and writes a commendable and readable precis not merely of the fighting but the poilitics and the later revolts including a brief precis of the much ignored Bar Kochba revolt under Hadrian. This has since got it's own title which I am currently reading."

            "Horrifically gory and intense, in a way you don't see that much in YA. Billy Dent has nothing on Marvin Burke. ",
            "Gritty, unflinching, and inventive. There are some fantasy-like elements, but the entire story is infused with a very real sort of horror. I haven't seen this often in YA, so the brutality caught me off guard, but I couldn't look away from it.Very well done. This one puts Krause on my read-everything-from-this-author list. ",
            "The writing is pretentious and Kraus overplays his hand with foreshadowing and symbolism that is frequently undercut by how stupid and/or impossible actions are. In reaction to news of his father's prison escape, Ry bends over to throw up and the vomit runs across the significant-as-it-was-inflicted-by-his-father scar on his forehead between his brows. Except--wouldn't his nose be in the way? And in the end, Ry is determined to bury his father's dog--significant!--despite broken bones, multiple lacerations, and over a day of trauma. Shock, what's medical shock? Ry is helped by the Unnamed Three, who are probably imaginary friends. I think Kraus is trying to create an unsettling atmosphere with these creatures intruding into normal life, but since normal life is so haphazardly and carelessly portrayed, they just seem like another heap of bullshit. Some concrete examples: the characters who are 9 and 10 seem more like 6 or 7 year-olds, injuries don't have realistic repercussions or even always realistic causes (Ry's sister slides down a slope into a hot meteorite in a pool of hot water and only burns her fingers, not even her palm, Ry's father gets third degree burns and walks about half a mile and can still try to kill Ry--and more!), the neighbors and an escaped convict show up just in time for plot-mandated actions. Actually, most of the characters behave in a plot-mandated rather than a character-driven manner.Just plain objectionable: manhood is explicitly linked to violence.Also, one random chapter from Sarah's point of view, and one from Jo Beth's. ???"

            "Oh man. OK. SO this book. If I were rating this purely on my own personal book preferences and tastes, I think I would have immediately given it five stars. Unfortunately, because I am a librarian who works with kids, I cannot rate books without thinking about them in terms of the intended audience. So. I downgraded it (almost painfully, mind you) to four. What I loved:This book is true horror. Not horror in the sense that EEK! something might jump out at you, but horror in a deep, visceral, cerebral way. Horror in the way I like it. Pervasive terrifyingness based on the fact that everything you thought was safe and comfortable is monstrous -- including your own being. The writing is beautiful. Beautifully terrifying. I kept finding myself reading passages out loud for their chill-inducing horrifyingness. I love beautifully horrific language. It's like Ray Bradbury except instead of describing the feeling of a summer's day you're describing everything you know and understand just crumbling apart into terribleness. The structure and setting choices. I am not quite sure why this book takes place in 1981 instead of present day...but for some reason it just needs to. It feels right. It was smart. Why I gave it one less star:I really ... really don't think this is a teen novel. It is about a nineteen year old. It is about confronting your parents and to some extent growing from a boy into a man. And those ways, it is DEFINITELY a teen novel. The problem is, I cannot think of ONE patron who I would give this book to who is under the age of 18. I just...can't. It's so brutal, and while I know there are teens out there who will love it, I don't think I will recommend it unless I come across the exact right kid. Because it's kind of traumatizing. I'm glad I read it though, because I think it is brilliant and there ARE teens out there who need this book. But I will not be recommending it widely. I can't wait to find the teen who this book speaks to though, because I think connecting the RIGHT teen to this book would be magical. Maybe someone who has read all of Steven King and is looking for their next book. Upper upper high school. Abuse and language and violence and sex and pretty much everything in extreme.",
            "If you want true YA horror, look no further. Ry's father Marvin was an abusive, horrific man. His father put his mother through hell, and it was Ry who helped save his mother back when he was way too young, too impressionable, and too vulnerable to have that sort of responsibility heft upon him. But Marvin was locked up years ago for it. Things change now that the meteorite is predicted to hit. The first clue is the appearance of a stranger on the family farm, claiming an explosion at the high security prison allowed him to get free. The second clue is that Ry's father isn't locked up where they thought he was locked up. He was locked up at the prison where the explosion occurred. Marvin is coming back to the family farm, and he's out for blood. Kraus's book is incredible dark and creepy, with tension and pacing keeping one another in check. The story is set in the 1980s, and it has to be for a number of reasons: the plausibility is one of them (though it's forgivable) and also, it's a historical setting -- this isn't set up so readers believe it happened today. Rather, it's purposefully in the past because that enhances the chill factor when the book ends.  Readers want to know what happened to Ry and his family now. Did he ever recover? Can he? Can someone born to an abusive father learn how not to be abusive himself? Does the cycle ever end?  The questions lingering are as important as those answered. Ry compartmentalized and repressed the fear and hatred toward his father when he was young and watched as his mother  was sewn to her bed and brutalized mercilessly . In doing so, he took on three personas: Jesus Christ, Mr. Furrington, and Scowler. Though toys, they aren't really toys: they're very different parts of his personality, and it's through the course of his past converging with his present that Ry is able to rectify these three elements of self. There is also the brilliant metaphor of the meteorite, of the dying farm, of family and saving, and of whether or not monsters can ever really know what they truly are. This isn't a light read. It's not for the weak of stomach. It's graphic, it's disturbing, it's unsettling, and it's gory. Even as someone who has a tough stomach for these things, it was a tough read. Ry, his mother, and his sister are  good  characters, so watching what happens to them is tough. Knowing what obstacles stand in their course isn't enjoyable. But that's the whole point of a book like this -- sometimes, we have to face what's ugly. And in Ry's case, sometimes, it's not just the things outside himself.  My favorite line in the entire book sums this up so well and it sort of sums up what made this entire horrific ride so worthwhile -- Being made of liquid and bone, rather than cloth and steel, might make you breakable, but being breakable, he decided, was a thrilling thing. Damn right. Give this to readers who want horror, who want dark, and who want to be shaken. It's not just about the gritty plot: Kraus has writing chops. The marriage of the two is excellent.Full review here: http://www.stackedbooks.org/2013/03/s... ",
            "The only book I LISTENED to that terrified me----was the radio drama Brave New World. My parents were on a road trip to MS and they played this dramatized version during our nighttime travels. I had nightmares for weeks. This book here had me equally as terrified while I road tripped to Wisconsin. What was so amazing, is I wasn't even EXPECTING it. Here I thought was going to get a kiddie creepy version of Stephen King----and nope. FULL. BLOWN. OUT. OF. MY. COMFORT. ZONE. Let's talk about my stages of comfort. The first few CD's-----I was more or less---at this stage:  Which quickly morphed into being at this point---a few discs later when he  finds his mom and surviving the gladesKRAUS HAD ME SCREAMING AND TALKING TO MY SELF---The end of the book when you've gone through a whole 24+ hours after impact (based off the book timeline): I'm SURE the drivers on the road where terrified of me. I was constantly screaming NOOOOOO!!! JESUS TAKE THE WHEEL OMG OMG OMG OMG OMG!!!! WHYYYYYYYYYYYYYY----F*$K YOU MARVIN. It has been a long time since I powered through a book that INSANELY outside my regular reading material. This book drained me, but I feel I've come so far in just undergoing that uncomfortable experience. I have some friends I would definitely recommend this book too---and some who would behave like:  In the end, I didn't regret my decision. I can see why this book won awards, and while the plot could be consider somewhat convoluted----I would still persevere. Kraus did an excellent job, and I was happy that didn't end in complete despair. ",
            "Scowler without a doubt was the scariest and darkest book I have ever read in the young adult genre. It makes I Hunt Killers look like Sesame Street. It's Stephen King meets Silence of the Lambs and it held me captive from page one. Disturbing imagery, and heart-racing scenes had me completely spellbound as I searched for closure from this nightmare. This was a thrilling ride and I enjoyed every dark, gritty, heart pounding moment.The tale begins when we meet Ry Burke, his little sister Ella and their mom. Their farm is in shambles and the fields dormant since their father was sent to jail nine years ago after one of his abusive episodes went too far and ended with Ry being hospitalized. The farm is up for sale, money is tight but still Ry doesn\u2019t want to let go of his home. Meteorites fall from the sky bringing a monster to their door and the tale that unfolds forces Ry to resurrect his imaginary friends from childhood to protect him once again.At this point in my review I usually describe the characters but I think it\u2019s important that you discover the quirks and personalities of Ry, his mom and little Ella for yourself. I will say that they are fleshed out and you have a very strong sense of who they are and the events that carved them into the characters we meet before the meteorite hits. At the age of nine three toy figurines come to life and aid Ry during one of the darkest moments of his childhood. They are a kindly British chap named Mr. Furrington, a Gumby Jesus figure handed out in Sunday school and a handmade figure made from metal and cloth dubbed Scowler. At nineteen he no longer hears or plays with his childhood toys but as events unfold he must once again call on his imaginary friends.Scowler is a violent, dark, gritty, suspenseful tale that sent shivers down my spine and left me with images I shall never forget. The tale unfolds slowly with occasional flashbacks that help us understand Ry, his figurines and the father that tormented them all. The tale unfolds over the course of several days both preceding the meteorite and after. The family lives on a remote farm far from their closest neighbors leaving them isolated as the events unfold. Krauss crafts a story that reminded me of a Stephen King novel from his writing style to imagery. It is brutal, violent, and hand-wringing the type of book you cannot set down as the suspense and drama play out. While this is dubbed young-adult it pushes the envelope with its language and imagery. Unspeakable things happen at this farm and it\u2019s not for the faint of heart. Through characters and events the author does a wonderful job of foreshadowing as he builds towards climatic scenes. The toys Ry uses and the explanation of what they represent to Ry was brilliantly done. It was a fascinating look into the human mind's ability to cope with the unimaginable.Fans of horror and suspenseful mind-blowing thrillers will enjoy Scowler. Not for the faint of heart Kraus delivers a spine-chilling novel you won't soon forget. This was my first experience with the author and after reading Scowler I discovered he wrote a book called Rotters that from reviews promises classic horror at its finest. I will definitely be picking it up. Four and half cups of espresso out of five ARC provided in exchange for unbiased reviewSee more of my reviews @ Caffeinated Book Reviewer"

            "Slow to start but enjoyable to finish",
            "This is a spin off series from Melissa Mayhue's Daughters of the Glen series. For new readers it may be confusing as several events in previous books are relied on to set the stage and could be confusing.I liked the move away from the Fae-descended heroes and heroines. This was still full of all the tension and twists that are Mayhue's traditional forte. I felt like the whole Northman/Odin thing was interesting and I was disappointed that it wasn't really developed.I didn't like the way Malcolm couldn't be the hero and get rid of Torquil himself. I also didn't like the way Torquil having extra something for being first born set him up as a really powerful bad guy and there was no resolution in this way. But that's just my personal taste.I did like Malcolm and Danielle's romance and I thought it was sweet.Obviously the set up means that Christiana's story will be next but I do hope the ever present Patrick will get to met his Soul Mate too.Side Note:I read the teaser for Warrior's Rebirth which will be the second book in the Warrior series and can I just say yay! The hero will be Chase Noble whose story I've been looking forward to since I heard about him in A Highlander's Destiny."

            "Warrior\u2019s Redemption by Melissa MayhueParanormal Romance \u2013 Dec. 27th, 20114 starsThis magical time travel romance story will amuse and entertain you!Dani has always been a dreamer. When her parents died, she lived with a harsh aunt but now she is on her own and alone. Dani has never felt like she fits in or belonged anywhere. For years, Dani believes in the magical fairies. After a terrible date, Dani makes a wish to finally belong on the night of Samhain when the separation between this world and the fairy\u2019s is the thinnest. Unbelievably she finds herself transported back in time to Scotland! There she meets a very brash and appealing highlander...Malcolm feels like a failure after the loss of his wife and his inability to control the current strife in his family. With the passing of his father, he is now at odds with his hateful, demanding elder half brother, Torquil. Torquil wants Malcolm's money from his inheritance and possession of Malcolm's sister for political gain. To add to Malcolm\u2019s troubles, his mother in law, Elesyria has suddenly decided to visit and claims to be a magical Faerie! Things only become more complicated when Malcolm stumbles on a fairy ring where he finds a strange and beautiful woman and feels an odd connection to her. But he doesn't know if he can believe her when she claims to be from the future.Soon Dani and Malcolm find themselves traveling together pretending to be betrothed to protect and deceive his brother. But what happens when pretending only seems too real?This is a light-hearted romp that readers who enjoy fun time travel romances and engaging characters will definitely relish. Dani is a plucky heroine, and it is fun to read how she adapts to historical Scotland. Malcolm has genuine emotion and warmth unlike many of the one dimensional male heroes. I really enjoyed reading both of them getting to know each other. Malcolm is a particularly likeable and a worthy hero. When Malcolm surrenders himself instead of paying the money his brother unfairly demands, I was torn by his suffering. I also found Dani to be a brave and compassionate heroine, and I loved that she tried to save Malcolm. Both were admirable and deserving main characters. Malcolm\u2019s mother-in-law, Elesyria is a particularly charming character as she brings some mischief into the story. Some sections of the story were a little improbable but the author makes you want to believe it and delight in it! I also liked how the romance was built slowly, and I could feel how they really came to love each other. Those who believe in fate and love fairy tale like romances will be delighted by this big-hearted and charming romance filled with danger and excitement.

            "Malcolm, has recently lost his wife, and blames himself for her death. Along with that, he is Laird of the Clan of MacGahan, and his sisters life is in danger from his older brother and he plans on rescuing her as soon as he can. Even though he is a descendant of Norse gods, he doesn't know how he will be able to protect his family and his clan from harm. Danielle has always believed in fairies. Ever since she was a little girl and read a book about fairies, she has, every day, for the past fifteen years, brought out some milk for them, no matter what is going on in the day, or the weather, she has remained constant in her belief in them. Dani believes that there is a purpose in her life, and that one day it will be revealed to her. She just has no idea what that purpose is. When Malcolm's mother in law comes for a visit, he questions why she would, since she is considered to be a fairy. But when she comes to the mortal world wanting to know the true reason of her daughter's death, she realizes how much Malcolm loved her daughter and tried to protect her. So as a reward to him, she decides to bring his soul mate to his side. On the evening of Halloween, which is the one moment you can commune with fairies Dani, goes through a ritual which lands her 700 years in the past and being rescued by Malcolm, who is determined that he doesn't fail Dani. At fist he wants to deny their attraction and the strong connection that only gets stronger. However he has certain obligations but he can't deny the true love he feels for Dani, but will he be strong enough to keep her from danger and at his side forever?Over the past couple of years I have enjoyed reading from this author, my local library has only a few of her books, so I haven't read much of her. But when I was browsing the shelves this past week, I saw that they had both of her newest books, and I just had to snatch them up. Melissa Mayhue has such a talent to bring out such beautifully written stories where the reader can't help but be swept away in the magical tales she writes. I fell in love with this from the beginning and it didn't take me very long to read it, and when that happens, you know its amazing!! Definitely easy to get into, and a quick read that is a bunch of fun and adventure.Warrior's Redemption starts out with this reader seeing both worlds of Malcolm and Dani. We see Malcolm trying his best to protect those he is over as best he can. But with the death of his wife, he blames himself and bears a whole world of weight of guilt on his shoulders. With worrying over his sister's welfare, and knowing he will have to marry a woman he doesn't know for a alliance that will bring justice for his older brother's wrong doings, he feels like his hands are tied. Then we go to Dani's side of things, who has been faithful in her devotion to the fairies no matter how many people ridicule or criticize her. She is a cook and works long hours that puts a roof over her head, but she wants more for her life. What she doesn't expect is to be brought in the past 700 years and to a medieval dominant man who makes her blood stir with passion. I enjoyed seeing these two develop into a relationship. I have always adored time travel romances, and this one is by far one of my favorites. I loved seeing the conflicts and how true love does conquer all. In this story, this couple are known as soul mates, which is the strongest union, and I also enjoyed the sense of magic that was played out in the story. It wasn't overly strong where it was the focus of the story, it was more like cream on top of a dessert, only added more flavor and deliciousness.Now lets talk about my favorite aspect of the story....the characters. Now I just adored all the characters in this story, there was so much depth to them (even the evil ones). Malcolm, is very alpha type but not too overly much either. He is from the late 1200's, so very medieval, but the honorable type. Pure yumminess, I just wanted to gobble him up. Where can I find my own fairy right? There was so much that I liked about him.A Warrior, has a tattoo( and a beautiful one at that), but has a few weaknesses that made him so real to me. I just wanted to kiss away all the sadness from him. Dani, hasn't exactly had the best luck in her life. Her aunt was her mother and raised her, but when she grows up she still believes in magic and fairies, and I found Dani to be a bit predictable at times, but I loved how she would fight for Malcolm. She doesn't ever back down from a fight, and risks her own life for him. I really admired her tenacity and devotion. She was a very likable character.Overall I found the story to be heart wrenching, and yet a beautiful tale of true love that bring two people that can't be more opposite and from two entirely different worlds. A riveting story from beginning to end, that made it a MUST NOT PUT DOWN read. Mixed with great humor, adventure, magic, and endearing characters that were deeply moving to the point that you can't help but fall in love all over again. A captivating love story that will take you on a adventure of a lifetime. A Magnificent start to the most recent series from this stellar author. A WINNER!!",
            "\u201cWarriors Redemption\u201d is a spinoff from Melissa Mayhue\u2019s Daughters of the Glen series. I was totally surprised that this book was not a continuation of the Daughters of the Glen series, as the hero in this book, was from an earlier book in that series (A Highlanders Homecoming). But Mayhue wins you over very quickly. Pretty much everything in this new storyline is similar, with a wonderful Highlander hero, his soulmate from the future, and the story taking place in old time Scotland. \u201cWarriors Redemption\u201d is about Malcolm MacDowylt, the Scottish laird and Danielle (Dani) Dearmon, a girl in present day, who believes in faeries. Dani Dearmon, a spunky and vivacious young girl, who spent 15 years waiting for the faeries to claim her for her destiny. On Halloween night, she creates a circle in her living room, and when she wakes up, she is in 1294 Scotland.Malcolm is having his issues, and it seems to be getting worse by the day. His sister and youngest brother are held captive by his half brother Torquil, who wants everything that Malcolm owns in exchange for their freedom. Then Elesyria, a faerie, who is Isabella\u2019s mother comes to visit Malcom. Yes the same Isabella, who escaped from MacDowylt , only to go back to the future with her soulmate Robbie and her ward Jaime. Though Malcolm blames himself for Isabella\u2019s \u2018death\u2019, Elesyria knows she is alive in another time. With that, she offers to give Malcolm a gift, something that would make him happy. His soulmate\u2026..,who happens to appear out of nowhere\u2026from the future. enter Dani\u2026\u2026\u2026..It is Elesyria who convinces Malcolm to find and save the young girl who was destined for him. When he finds her, she awakens and smacks him with a fearsome punch to his jaw, he then brings Dani back to his laird, with the help of his good brother, Patrick. It is there that they find his younger brother Dermid waiting for them. Dani, who catches on quickly, about Malcolm\u2019s problems, suggests that she be introduced as his betrothed, so no one would suspect anything. Dermid has come to collect Torquil\u2019s request for the freedom of his sister. Malcolm knows how evil and powerful Torquil is, and he refuses to allow Dermid to go with them, when they will travel to rescue Christiana, their sister. Christiana plays a major role in helping Malcolm and Dani, as she is also powerful in her own right, as she has the gift of vision.Dani and Malcolm made a nice couple, though I thought it was pretty quick that they ended up having sex. But I really liked them together, and it wasn\u2019t much longer that you could see them falling in love, and discovering the true meaning of being soul mates. But throughout the story, and the forthcoming battle to rescue Christiana, you are aware that Malcolm does not have enough manpower to fight Torquil. To stand up against him, he would have to make an alliance with another clan, which would force him to marry into that clan. The story gets very exciting, when Malcolm is captured and tortured by Torquil. It is Dani and Elesyria, who try to rescue him, with Christiana\u2019s help. As the battle between the powerful brothers comes to a climax, a few twists nearer to the end keeps this story open ended. However, just when Dani is willingly ready to return to future to save Malcolm, you get your happy ending. Mayhue does a wonderful job writing this story. It is light reading, fun, action filled and danger. You end up liking most of the characters, from Dani, Malcolm, Elesyria, Patrick, and Christiana. But as much as I enjoyed Malcolm, I loved Dani. She turns out to be a wonderful female character, and Mayhue does have a few good ones. Since this story ended with a lot more to come, I suspect Christiana will be in the next book.That being said, I worry that Mayhue, who is continuing this \u201cWarrior\u201d series, will let go of Daughters of the Glen. I hope not\u2026..I loved that series\u2026loved the feeling of family, friendship between the two time zones (future and past). I want to know more about Dallyn, Pol, Wynn, Dair, Sim, Rosie, as well as hear more about the friends we have come to love. Please Melissa, do not abandon them. Barb The Reading Cafe ",
            "View more of my review and others at my blog: www.mynotsovacantshelf.blogspot.comSo i desperately loved the Daughters of Glen series by Melissa Mayhue, and I couldn\u2019t wait to start up the second series of hers that takes place in the same world. Although its the same world and these characters were briefly mentioned in the Daughters of Glen series the magic of these stories are very different. The men of this series are descended from Vikings and believe in Norse mythology. There is little mention of the character from the Daughters of Glen series, but that more than ok, and there is definitely still talk and appearances from the Fae in the series. After so many books it was time to move past them. Now, after reading this novel I found the same kind of upstanding men, but something about the story line just didn\u2019t hit me like the Daughters of Glen series. I liked the Norse mythology and the men, but I think it was something to do with the romance between the two main characters. I plan on continuing the series hoping that this was just a one off. Good:Malcolm- A pretty great guyBad: Danielle\u2014Something about her bugged me a little. Overall the romance in this novel wasn\u2019t something that had me swooning. Overall (Writing style, story line, and general):As always the novel was easy to read and follow. I liked the characters enough and loved the chivalrous men. The story line and adventures was well plotted and an interesting part to the story. The change in mythology and compilation of the Fae and Norse mythology was interesting to read. Overall the book was a good read and I will be continuing on with the series.",
            "Oh the joy and diversion of an entertaining time travel/romance novel. I just love to dive into a book where you have to suspend any semblance of reality and just go with the fun. This is, I think, the third book by Ms. Mayhue that I have read and I was not disappointed. Her books are tales of the Faery and mortal world all mixed up with folk finding their SoulMate, the person that completes you. Sometimes the two happen to live centuries apart but that doesn't stop love.In this novel Danielle Dearmon lives in current times but has always believed in faeries going so far as to leave milk out for them every night so they have something to eat. She waits and waits and is about to give up when magic happens. Malcolm MacDowlyt is feeling like a failure in more ways than one when his mother in law, a Faery, comes looking for her daughter. He let her leave with the love of her life and he thinks she is dead but she is not! Because he cared enough to let her go with her SoulMate his mother in law will now help him - but he definitely does not feel he wants her help.The story rolls along with a well constructed plot and characters that you find yourself wanting to know - except for the bad guy, of course!

            "Melissa Mayhue has always been my goto author for anything Fae and Scottish. Warrior's Redemption is the first in a new series that features Malcolm MacDowylt as the new laird of clan MacGahan. He's another of those tortured heroes that I love so much. Of course he feels guilty for something that wasn't his fault and has the whole woe is me thing going on until Danielle Dearmon pops out of the clear blue sky and changes his whole way of thinking. Though Dani had a little bit of a duh moment when she finally gets what she wishes for. Once she sees the truth, things take a turn for the better and romance is in the air. I liked everything about this story except Torquil. What an asshat and I can't believe they didn't kill him when they had the chance. That is surely going to come back and bite them all right in the ass. I'm looking forward to others in the series."

It felt like coming home after a long, exhausting vacation.I wanted something spooky and supernatural, because duh, Halloween, but wasn't in the mood for gore or despair, and this was my perfect answer.Penelope is a protagonist you find yourself rooting for, even though she is flawed. Namely, she lacks much of a backbone. By the end of the book, you witness her really coming into her own, with the help of a ghostly friend. The mystery kept me guessing and it was fun to watch it unfold. I also appreciated that it lacked the common damsel-in-distress scene we so often get with females confronting murderers! I'm looking forward to more of this series, learning more about the characters and enjoying living vicariously in small-town New England running a bookstore!"

            "It took a few chapters to absorb this new environment and first journey with Alice Kimberley. I long ago tired of 18 year-old heiresses, or sassy singles but don\u2019t relate to Moms or divorc\u00e9es either. At last, Penelope McClure is a character that meets in the middle. It didn\u2019t take long to like this protagonist: nearer my age, flipping the bird at opinionated in-laws to pursue her own business. She had an unhappy marriage but more originally, she is a widow of suicide. Her son neatly fits into the picture, caring for his cat and helping at the store.The mystery is multifaceted and requires sleuthing and psychological profiling to solve. The most unique element is the ghost of a 1940s detective, teaching our heroine how to piece clues together and examine patterns with logic. It would be easy for any author to fall into the overdone mafia accent. These authors didn\u2019t. The private eye\u2019s tone isn\u2019t Italian but old New York. I loved the flavour it brought, which matches his period. Jack Sheppard was a famous investigator, who the world doesn\u2019t know was murdered at the site of Penelope\u2019s store. They both discover that they can converse telepathically and since he can\u2019t leave the premises, urges her to solve her guest author\u2019s death.The environment doesn\u2019t feel very metaphysical. At least one\u2019s first encounter with a spirit should carry reverence. The very few novelists writing serious \u201cstandard mystery\u201d paranormal fare fail at that, too nonchalant about apparitions, or making a mockery of what ought to be overwhelming or surreal. Perhaps I\u2019ll that emotional dynamic will be reflected elsewhere in this series. Besides the \u2018too cool to ruffle\u2019 aunt and the political lady, I like Penelope\u2019s townspeople. Her growth feels natural and I imagine Jack will learn from her too.",
            "Cleo Coyle, the pen name of husband-and-wife writing team Alice Alfonsi and Marc Cerasini, and is primarily known for writing The CoffeeHouse Mystery series, has another series written under another pseudonym of Alice Kimberly. The Haunted Bookshop features a bookshop owner who finds herself solving mysteries with the help of the bookshop's longtime resident: the ghost of a private eye who was murdered there in 1949. This first book in the series shares many similarities with The Ghost and Mrs. Muir, originally a 1946 novel written by Josephine Leslie writing under the name R.A. Dick, but most people will likely remember it from the 1947 movie adaptation starring Gene Tierney and Rex Harrison or the 1968 TV series with Hope Lange and Edward Mulhare. Like its titular counterpart, this book features a recently widowed young mother, Penelope Pen Thornton-McClure, who moves with her child to the small, seaside hometown of Quindicott, Rhode Island to find a fresh start after the suicide of her husband. Amid rumors of the place being haunted, she buys into her aunt's failing bookshop business, determined to turn it around. Pen hopes that her first book signing will be a step in the right direction. Hard-boiled mystery writer Timothy Brennan, famous for his novels featuring Jack Shield, based on the exploits of real-life private investigator Jack Shepard, is something of a letdown, he's rude, pompous and overbearing. Plus, Pen keeps hearing a persistent heckler during Brennan's presentation. And just as the author reveals a secret about her store's link to Shepard's disappearance over 50 years ago, he keels over dead himself. An even bigger surprise is waiting for Pen later that evening when she discovers that the heckler she was hearing during the event turns out to be the ghost of Jack Shepard himself, who tells her that Brennan's death was not from natural causes, but murder. The book is a little disjointed in the first chapter, as it starts with the aftermath of the author's murder, then flashes back to several hours before in the following chapters, but it has a brisk pace and was a quick read, The characters of Jack Shepard and Pen McClure are very well fleshed out, but many of the supporting characters are somewhat two-dimensional, particularly Pen's aunt Sadie (for the fun of it, I pictured her as Hope Lange, who played the widowed mother in The Ghost and Mrs. Muir TV series). And while I enjoyed some of the excerpts that were featured at the beginning of each chapter since they were from hard-boiled mystery novels, some excerpts didn't seem to belong, like the ones featuring quotations from Mark Twain, Oscar Wilde, and in particular, the keynote address from the 2003 British Booksellers Association conference.However, I greatly enjoyed the bantering between Pen and Jack, as well as the scene in which Pen has a dream where she visits with Jack in his 1940's office, wearing clothes and hairstyle native to the time period. I liked the idea that as Pen works with her neighbors to solve the case, she is unable to tell them of certain clues because they were provided by her unseen ghostly partner. All in all, a fun read, and I'll be interested to check out other books in the series.",
            "It's the new meets the old when a ghost of a P.I. that was killed about 50 years ago helps Pen (co-owner of a book store) solve a murder of an author at an event being held at the book store. Only Pen can hear him and when he allows, see him. I can't wait to read the next book in the series.",
            "With the newest of this series coming out soon, I just had to start the series so I would know what the buzz about Jack Shepard was. I can definitely say I'm in love with that ghost, lol! What an amazing character! He and Pen worked well together as a sleuthing team...once he convinced her that she wasn't crazy and that yes, she really could hear him in her brain. Jack talked her through a very cool sting operation to get the perp to confess. It worked and the person who killed the famous author in Pen's store was in custody.I really enjoyed the character of Pen's son, Spencer. He wasn't your typical kid. I imagined him as Young Sheldon only with a little more of a loving nature. I liked that he and Pen were strong enough to stand up to her late husband's family and let them know that Spencer wasn't going to cave and do what their McClure children did in high society. Spence loved the bookstore and helping his mom. I enjoyed the interaction of Aunt Sadie, although aside from Pen, Spencer and Jack, it's pretty clear that as nice as she is, those three are the primary characters, at least in this book. The cookie bakery owners, Linda and Milner seemed like nice people. Milner was a good comic relief at times. I can't wait to read the next book. I really am going to make myself wait before I dig into the 6th book when it releases. I want to savor all the awesomeness that is Jack Shepard! ",

            "The perfect ghost for a mystery!We all know a small town bookstore focused on mysteries is a perfect setting for a mystery. This book pulls a past mystery into perfect connection with a new murder, ties the two inextricably together, adds a little haunting, and keeps the pages turning.The ghost, the main character and her struggles and self doubts, and the setting were the best parts of this book. The mystery storyline was somewhat predictable, but that didn\u2019t stop me from loving this book!"

            "This is the prettiest manga cover I have ever seen and I want it",
            "Watching a rerun of Law and Order: Special Victims Unit was more intriguing than this manga. I get it. Reading about the sexual exploitation of women is a serious subject, no matter what historical period you set it in or what format you choose to tell the story. My biggest problem with this manga lies in its main character, Kiyoha. Yes, she's a survivor. She is also strong-willed, wily to a certain degree and extremely rebellious, especially as a young girl. I should feel more sorry for her because she was sold to a brothel as a young girl but you get the sense that author does not want you to pity her. In fact, I am not sure how the author seems to want to treat her heroine. Kiyoha is definitely not an early feminist here. In fact, Kiyoha is a blank slate devoid of dreams, hopes and aspirations. There is a couple scenes when Kiyoha tries to escape but I was left wondering if she even knew why she wanted to leave. There is no back story for Kiyoha although I think I got the impression that both her parents were dead so if that was the case, who is she trying to go back to and why. The only clear message I got from this manga was that all johns are scum. This is evident in the way they treat the courtesans from haggling over the price, who gets to deflower the newest courtesan, etc. It's a tough manga to read because there is not a single redeeming or likeable character in the story, including the heroine. ",
            "This was the first thing I read in my manga masterworks class, and I really appreciate Anno\u2019s work! It\u2019s a very subversive sh\u014djo work, it combines classic elements like style pictures with more subdued 90\u2019s conventions, like minimal panel gutters. The Edo period is a setting, but Sakuran isn\u2019t a period piece, it\u2019s definitely a modern story. It\u2019s exciting and frustrating and heartbreaking, all while being a short read!"

            "Introducing Kiyoha: first-time smoker(comment courtesy of Katie Jett Walls)I care about women. And not just because they're mine or I have some familial duty to the ones who are related to me. I care about women because somewhere over the last twenty years, I began to empathize with them. Not all at once probably, but gradually. It came along with being able to empathize with all sorts of people who were not me. When I was twenty, I didn't get people. At all. I found everyone obnoxious and dull. I liked girls, sure, but only because I wanted to eventually carve myself into their lustrous flesh.1 I wasn't the greatest of people when it came to other people. I spent my childhood and teen years painfully shy, unable to make many friendships and so: unable to really get the knack of understanding how and why others might feel the things they might feel. I attribute this lack of empathy to something beyond the mere fact of my awkward introversions. I could have still learned to understand people had only I kept reading. But I didn't.I had been a voracious devourer of books up until junior high when suddenly my book-nerdiness became a social liability. I stopped reading lit entirely and instead picked up comics, which were dumb enough not to seem Smart. Dorky but not nerdy.2 A relevant fallout of this decision was that I was no longer reading the books that would have taught me to relate to characters of complex motivations and differing cultural foundations. Instead, I wallowed in seven years of cardboard characters with unrealistic motivations and monolithic concerns. It wasn't comics that made me unsympathetic, but they sure didn't help.(Comics in that era, of course, were nowhere near so varied or valuable as they are today. Three cheers for progress toward the visio-narrative utopia, eh?)In any case, when I hit age twenty I realized my social survival no longer depended on pretending not to like books\u2014so I jumped right back in. I gradually began, with the help of fictional figures voicing the concerns of real authors, to soften. It was a slow road. I began to better understand people who were not me\u2014or at least to apprehend that it was okay that they were not me. Fellow Americans of different cultural backgrounds, then people of ethnicities that were not straight-up Caucasian, then those outside the heterosexual spectrum, then those of foreign soil, then believers in different gods and ideologies. And then women. The order might be off but then again it might not. Regardless, over the nearly two decades that passed after my twentieth birthday, I grew a lot as a human and am thankful for the books that lit my path.And now all that is to say: when I approach a book like Sakuran, the experience is emotional for me. Moyocco Anno's book is about women in distressing circumstances, and throughout I felt the weight of the whole history that has arrayed itself against the female existence. I think of my wife, my daughter, my mother, my friends, women I know from the internet, and women I don't know at all and will never know. Societies over the long centuries and societies in this very moment have not made living the kindest of experiences for women\u2014societies governed and purposed by my people, by men. I hate us for these inequities and a book like Sakuran fills me with tidal waves of regret and sadness, even if that is not its purpose.That right there kind of justmakes you want to throw up on everybody foreverMoyocco Anno's Sakuran concerns Kiyoha, an 18th-century courtesan who is destined (by Anno's pen) to become the most celebrated of all the houses in Yoshiwara.3 Anno begins by introducing Kiyoha as she nears the height of her fame and then peels back for the rest of the book to chart the woman's course across what turns out to be a hard and bitter sea. Kiyoha is a strong female character in the sense that she survives to better herself through her experiences, but simultaneously, she is not immune to her circumstances and her life of prostitution under contract to her house takes evident toll on her. She realizes the world she's trapped by is terrible and makes the best of it, but she never shies away from acknowledging the reality that her role as courtesan is dominated by paternal influences.Kiyoha, being paternally influencedThis is my first experience of Anno's artwork and it took me rather off-guard. Sakuran's art is bizarre and kind of wonderful. Her figurework is hyper-limber and her poses extend into a vibrant sort of grotesque.4 Characters motivate through a series of light physical impossibilities that work to provoke a sense of awkwardness that mirror Sakuran's narrative force. For those who critique manga for the Japanese creators' penchant for focusing too much on the eyes as a conveyance for emotion,5 the eyes in Anno's work will be awestriking. Belle's eyes in Beauty &amp, the Beast are much larger than the average manga character's, and Kiyoha's eyes in Sakuran are much larger than Belle's. We've heard the clich\u00e9 of a person's eyes being pools and The Lovely Bones introduced the treacle nickname Ocean Eyes. Kiyoha's eyes would make Ocean Eyes look like two raindrops by the comparison. These two globes are as soulful as all the blues that spawned in the first decades of the 20th century combined. I mean, look at this:I have it on pretty good authority that sakuran refers to confusion or derangement or mental agitation. The book's subtitle Blossoms Wild, as well as an apt description of the madness of Kiyoha's blooming sexuality under such a terrifying commodification of the female self, seems pretty probably a play on the homophony between sakuran and sakura, the Japanese term for cherry blossoms (and one of the more well-known Japanese words in America, thanks to the influx of manga and anime imports). Kiyoha's maturing and sexual bloom within the walls of the pleasure house is agitating for the character as well as for the reader. It seems trite to compare our distress to hers, but it's Anno's implication of the reader into the intimacies of Kiyoha's decade of depetaling6 that provokes the reader to empathize with Kiyoha's state\u2014even if to a lesser degree.While the broad strokes of Kiyoha's tale will be readily accessible (and possibly familiar7) to American readers, there's a lot that will likewise confuse (or at the least remain unobserved). Anno relies on a lot of cues that are probably easily discerned by Japanese readers and those more intimately familiar with Japanese feudal history and culture. I have perhaps a better than usual grasp of Japanese history for an American of non-Asian roots but am by no means fluent in the nation's culture and history\u2014and I was oftentimes stumped by the meaning of things occurring on Anno's stage. Some of my difficulty certainly lay in the staccato nature of Anno's panel choices (what she'd show and what she wouldn't) and some of it lay in my difficulty in discerning identities of characters, but the bulk of any interpretive wrangling may have been due to my ignorance of era and history.8Despite the occasional struggles that slowed my reading, I found Sakuran an affecting work, harrowing and draining.9 I'm not sure if Anno plans any further exploration of Kiyoha (though the book wraps rather tidily), but Sakuran merits further exploration from readers if the ground is there to be tread. Footnotes1) Metaphorically speaking, of course.2) The distinction was important to me back then.3) Yoshiwara was the famous pleasure district in Edo (present-day Tokyo). Its houses of prostitution form the background for numerous literary works concerned with the era.4) Tip of hat to Tom Spurgeon's review that made this description click for me.5) An unhelpful and boring critique, even when phrased more obliquely as: I don't like manga because their eyes are so big. The complaint nearly always falls flat as a strange sort of hypocrisy because American cartoon styles (such as, say, Disney's used in Beauty &amp, the Beast) use oversized eyes extensively as well, and generally not to so attentive effect as many examples of manga.6) I recognize the preciousness of describing a woman's initiation into coupled sexual experiences as deflowering, but Anno almost pushes the description by her title. As well, the coercive nature of Kiyoha's sexual engagements are rapacious and demanding and strip her of any of the tenderness we treasure in the potential warmth of the sexual act.7) I often kept in mind Catherine McCormack's courtesan's life in 1998's Dangerous Beauty. The similarities are as vivid as the contrasts. While Dangerous Beauty pits the hypocrisies of the church against its protagonist, Kiyoha only struggles against her society's view of the woman (or at least the pleasure house woman) as disposable.8) My wife here disagrees with my assessment of rating the book Good despite the difficulty I had with sometimes knowing what was going on. She felt that the issues of narrative interpretation were (perhaps even intentionally on the artist's part) principally the fault of Anno's design choices rather than brought on by our cultural discrepancies. Michelle appreciated the work that she thought was being attempted but evaluates the work as actually accomplished as only being Okay.9) Emotional involvement is always very subjective, of course, so I will always suspect my own history and circumstance governing me rather than the work\u2014but I would be irresponsible not to mention it.________Review courtesy of Good Ok Bad.",

When Grace goes to visit her father in Gambia, she struggles to adjust to the culture and her new family, eventually realizing that her family is perfect just the way it is. Genre: Multicultural. Grace is African-American, her parents are divorced, and her father lives in Africa. She struggles to adapt to the unfamiliar culture when she visits Africa, but she also embraces it. This book can really help students understand the struggles of their peers whose parents may be divorced, or any immigrant classmates that may be struggling to adapt to cultural changes. Reading Level: MWriting Mentor Traits:Organization: Boundless Grace hooks the reader in the first paragraph and wraps the story up with a memorable and satisfying ending. Students could use it as a mentor text for writing their own hooks and conclusions. Other Classroom Uses: You could also discuss what a family is and that families can be very different but still wonderful. Students could write their own stories about what family means to them. ",
            "This story is about a young girl whose parents are separated in her father lives in Africa she is sad that there isn't any stories about parents who aren't together only stories about Mom and Dad brother and sister and a cat and a dog and she felt like her family wasn't complete. She got to visit her father and Africa and over the time she got to meet her father's side of the family she also felt like she didn't fit in because her dad already had a daughter and son with the Stepmom but nana had told her families are what you make of them so in the end she decides to write stories about how her family is and says stories are of what you make of them just like families are what you make of them",
            "This book did a wonderful job in highlighting non-traditional families. Many students today do not realize that there is another world outside of what they know. I had previously read the first book in this series Amazing Grace. Although I enjoyed this book, I do not think it held up to the expectations from the first book. This story still hits a good mark while describing the new life of a young girl who is now faced with a situation she never could have imagined. This book, and series, would be a good addition to any classroom library. "

            "THE LAST BOOK IN THE DARK ELITE SERIES, YES LET'S GET SOME CLOSURE AND PLOT LINES FINISHED!Yeah, no. Not going to happen.I was so disappointed in this last book. I was actually going to give it a 3 because I assumed we'd get some things explained BUT THE ENDING SUCKED.Now\u2026 I would have been okay if this wasn't the last book in the series\u2026 but it so happens that it is.WHAT THE BEEP? LIKE NOTHING WAS EXPLAINED! There is literally a million questions I would like answered that never even got touched upon!(1) Why does Lilly have fire spell, does it run in her family?AUTHOR ANSWER: Who knows, is that really a question that needs answering? The past is in the past. Lets live in the present. Where Lilly has fire spell and can do cool things. I like this better.(2) What secret stuff are Lilly's parents doing overseas, obviously it's involved with the Dark Elite?AUTHOR ANSWER: You know\u2026 you're really annoying. The book is about LILLY not her parents\u2026 geez.(3) What sort of issues is Jason dealing with and why aren't we hearing about them?AUTHOR ANSWER: OMG Jason is a sub character that I put in there for sexy times with Lilly. No one actually cares about what he does. Only that he looks cool and is pretty.(4) Why haven't we heard anything else about the research centre that Lilly broke into in Chicago?AUTHOR ANSWER: I got bored with that storyline, can we move on please?(5) OK\u2026 THEN PLEASE ANSWER WHY SEBASTIAN BORN IS HELPING LILLY WHEN HE'S SUPPOSED TO BE THE ENEMY??AUTHOR ANSWER: Because he's hot. She's hot. They're hot together. I needed a love triangle. Plus I don't really know\u2026 I didn't think about it\u2026(6) *PULLS OUT HAIR* SEBASTIAN SAYS THE REAPERS ARE HELPING PEOPLE IN PRIVATE\u2026 SO LIKE\u2026 GOING TO EXPLAIN THAT SHIT?AUTHOR ANSWER: Urghhh just because I lightly mentioned it doesn't mean I have to go fully into it. Believe what you want.(7) So the reapers may not be actually bad?AUTHOR ANSWER: Look, I have other books to write. I'm leaving now, BYE!ME: #headdesk #dead #fail #WHATTHESHIT????This short fictional interview will sum up the book for you. Good luck.",
            "Okay, so this was horrible.First off, the writing was all wrong. It sounded like a 7th grader was narrating, mixed in with such great revelations at all the wrong times it was almost sounded funny. Okay, so people don't think like that, it takes them a while to find out what they're missing, and when they do, it's not all written in their head already. It was so fake, and Lily irritated me, not for any reason, just because she was there.And then Jason. His relationship with Lily didn't seem real, and all those pesky little things about him and his family? We never know what's going to happen. It was like it was too hard to think up his world, so you know what? Just don't include it! Ugh. And then the way he was described as a werewolf, to me, he was a skinny little dog that stood up on his hind legs and walked like a man. The description was that bad. Adding on that, I had no idea what any of them looked like, just that Lily's eyes were lined with black. It was ridiculous. One thing I like was Sebastian, but he was really downplayed in the book. He keeps helping out Lily, but we never know why. His role is implied as a love interest, but nothing ever happens. He was a source of information, that's all. That was horrendous. And the last thing I hated was the ending. So many things were just left off, and nothing was ever accomplished. Reapers were still bad, Sebastian was still a Reaper, Adepts were still good, and Lily was still an Adept. Uh huh, nothing happened, just a bunch of little sidetracks. It was boring, but I managed to finish it. Though I may regret that a little now.",
            "Unfortunately, the action in these books are quickly decreasing, and the summaries of these books are very misleading. I really thought Lily would actually be in Reaper territory, for those who were wondering, not really.Once again, I have no feelings for Jason other than he's somewhat very emotional. He was barely in it, other than to throw a little fit when he found out that Lily had been talking to Sebastian. Frankly, the only things I got from him in this book is that he keeps a ton of secrets from Lily  the fact that he never tells her what is going on with his family and the girl his parents plan to set him up with , he can be very emotional  he throws a fit when Lily mentions getting info from Sebastian, info that could really help their side, then he practically says she's a bad guy because she used the info to help them , and the author will try to push him on you as your fav character  The author tries hard to make us like him. She has Jason save Lily at the end, he apologizes (as if that makes it any better), she tries to make it seem like Lily has no other offers, and she tries to blatantly ignore his arranged marriage that we still have no information about . Honestly, just give us some information about this guy and I may start to semi-like him.Sebastian. I like Sebastian a lot more than Jason. He's at least honest with Lily  he does have to get a little push from Lily to admit about Fayden, but at least he mentions his family to Lily unlike Jason . The facts are, she's starting to know more about Sebastian than she knows about Jason. Also, I'm getting to know Sebastian more than Jason, and that's wrong if Jason is supposedly the main love interest. And I also just like the connection they share, their firespell.Veronica and Nicu? What the heck? If the author took out these parts, then maybe we could have a little bit more action. I just wish she would cancel out this whole brat pack drama and just go with the actual action in the book. And it's sad to say, but I seem to know more about Veronica and Nicu's relationship than I do about Lily and Jason's. Please focus on the main storyline, instead of this lame side story. It honestly could have been left out.Honestly, the author said there was going to be three book on her website. Well, this book definitely ended off where it would need a fourth book. Are we going to get 10 or more books out of this series like the Chicagoland Vampires. (I would never pick up that series.)Sadly though, these books have so much more potential. The author could really sell this idea if she'd focus just a little bit less on school drama. You know, there are some teenage girls that just avoid it completely. They also don't join the Sneak committee to cause more drama. They just avoid the drama queens and do their own things. We still aren't getting any answers, let's focus on getting answers rather than creating more distractions (Veronica/Nicu drama, Brat Pack drama, Sneak decoration committees, and boyfriend/girlfriend drama). Give us some answers, build up your side characters more. We have this group of Adepts that didn't expand any more than the previous book, I think they have personalities too?In all, I would not recommend this series. There's a lack of action and answers, not to mention too much drama. Unfortunately, I want to keep reading. I think the book covers are tricking me, but they're pretty cool. I loved the color scheme and I want that outfit! (Especially the arm warmers and black skeleton key necklace. I actually have a black skeleton key, but I just have simple chain.) I think the cover is also misleading, I thought it was Lily in disguise to join the Reapers, I was wrong....For now, these will remain my guilty pleasure.Chloe Neil's Wesite Quote: There are three books in the Dark Elite series, and no current plans for a fourth book. Really? You kind of left it off to where it required a 4th book...At least if there is no 4th, I can create my own ending in my mind. Though with so many unanswered questions, it'd be very difficult...",
            "It didn't take me long to read this book. Three hours if we're really keeping track. And. . .I liked it but . . . I didn't at the same time. I was disappointed. In Hexbound I was totally enthralled by Sebastian, I truly thought that despite what side he played for he wasn't all bad. Even now I don't think he is. But seeing as I don't know if there will be a fourth book no one will ever really know.In the first book Jason Shepard is THE guy. The one that seems ideally right for Lily. But in Hexbound, you see that spark at the end between Lily and Sebastian that might mean something. But in Charmfall, Jason throws a tantrum which I guess is normal for his characterized alpha-male persona. All because Lily took a risk trying to get information by talking to Sebastian. And in the end when it comes time to make up, Lily just forgives him. As if him doubting her was okay when not three paragraphs before she referred to him as her ex-boyfriend. I thought given the kind of person she was she would have stuck up for herself. I'm not saying I wanted them to be over--my Sebastian fantasies aside--it would have been nice to see how different Lily presented herself between the two gentlemen. Yes, Sebastian is older than her and she isn't even 16 yet but he deserved a shot if you asked me. A fair shot.Then you have the issue with her parents. You go through the first two books and know that something isn't right with Lily's parents--that they're hiding big secrets from Lily and why she ended up in Chicago. Throughout this whole book the parental issue was never even pursued. Of course she could have just been taking Foley's advice and leaving the matter alone until she can truly ask them face-to-face.The book was awesome. It's not a lie. I felt it was unsatisfying, but it still made me laugh continuously with the heavy sarcasm between Lily and Scout. I haven't seen any evidence that there will be another book but the way the book ended it seemed to be that sort of the door is closed but not locked. if that made any sense, I applaud you because I totally just made that up.

            "Charm Falls FlatChicago's having a crisis of epic power proportions. There seems to be an epidemic of blackouts within the city limits. Unfortunately the shortages aren't of the electrical variety. Chi-Town's Dark Elite, Reapers and Adepts alike are amidst a magical misfortune, losing their abilities like a flip of a switch. Lilly and her crew are going to have to make some unlikely alliances to solve the mystery of missing magic and get their powers back.Third time is not a charm for Neill's current installment in her Dark Elite series. While the story line was good, it just didn't have that WOW factor. Charmfall is yet another lost opportunity to really develop this series and the wonderful ideas presented in it. Neill's solid story line was smothered by the surrounding filler and useless banter that kept the main characters meandering about slowly, focusing more on dance decorations, verbal bestie bonding, and the detailed travels of subterranean Chicago. Much of which has been adequately covered in the past two books. The new larger format paperback didn't help matters either. It seems more of a waste for a book barely 240 pages deep and ridiculously includes the first two chapters of book one, Firespell, for the only reason I can decipher, to bulk up the book. I would have preferred the extra possible capacity be used toward a little more action or development of the secondary story lines. Increasingly I am finding that the supporting characters are more interesting as well, and think an alternate perspective could breathe some much needed depth to the books. Sebastian Born for example is an under utilized character. He has differing ideas about magic not inline with either faction and I think his POV could be riveting. I really liked what was happening with Nicu's thread, which was touched upon when convenient, but barely explored. I was also hoping for the real complication of Jason's background to come about, maybe a betrothed to spice things up, but he's just stressed out by the family problems vaguely mentioned. Even the author's weak attempt at painting Parker as a different thinking Adept just didn't hold. Plus she didn't touch on Parker's parents and past threads involving them at all. Neill also is becoming the timid love triangle queen. Much like her Chicagoland Vamp books, any possible angst between Jason, Lilly, and Sebastian seem null at this point, regardless of the groundwork thats there. What this book is really lacking is that OMG factor that leaves you pining for the next installment. Charmfall is a watered down version of what the series could be, with good ideas, characters, and story lines that are never really explored. Neill's YA books feel like an afterthought and are clearly becoming a backseat series to her adult work. I really wish she would put as much effort and passion into the series as she does when describing her hometown eats. If not maybe she should forego fiction and focus on an epicurious guide to chi-town's great culinary offerings.",
            "This series always makes me feel old, it definitely captures teenagers better than most. Which is a good thing, it makes it feel fresh. But this installment suffered even more than the last one from a serious lack of action. Most of the book was about the girls walking down to the tunnels, then back to their rooms, then back to the meeting room in the tunnels again. I like that Lily and Scout are staring to question the shades of grey in the world of the Adepts and the Reapers, but little other than hints about the workings behind the scenes was revealed. And nothing at all about the mystery about her parents and why Lily was sent to the school was even brought up. So overall it was one of those treading-in-place installments in a series. ",

This book explores eight exemplary cases from the United Kingdom, the United States, and Australia that show the law as a living, breathing, and down-the-street experience. It explores the social circumstances in which the cases arose and the ordinary people whose stories influenced and shaped the law as well as the characters and institutions (lawyers, judges, and courts) that did much of the heavy lifting. By examining the consequences and fallout of these decisions, the book depicts the common law as an experimental, dynamic, messy, productive, tantalizing, and bottom-up process, thereby revealing the diverse and uncoordinated attempts by the courts to adapt the law to changing conditions and shifting demands. Great cases are one way to glimpse the workings of the common law as an untidy, but stimulating exercise in human judgment and social accomplishment.",

            "Important Edit (2)The person who gave up this poor woman to the police was her own brother. He said she is a Muslim and deserves to die for marrying a Christian. She says their father died when she was 8 and she was brought up as a Christian by her Ethiopian mother. Muslim men are allowed to marry who they please. All Muslim women must marry Muslim men otherwise it is an offence punishable by death. Her own brother... These men must be brought up to think women are one step up from dogs. Get rid of the ones who don't please you. Murder being the cheapest, fastest and easiest and either legal or at least acceptabe way.Edit (1)  First we have the good news - the poor woman sentenced to a 100 lashes and then death by hanging for marrying a Christian has been reprieved and will no longer be killed.Then we have the bad news. She will still get the 100 lashes for committing adultery as the court annulled her marriage and therefore she had sex outside marriage and must be punished.Then we have the worse news. Her lawyers say they fear for her safety among the religious Islamic population (they mean the men) when she is released.________The weirdest, even most atrocious, things can be legal. The poor woman who got beaten to death by her father and brothers as she exited the High Court in Lahore was not necessarily killed illegally. Honour killings are not crimes it seems. Police officers were present and did nothing but watch. What had happened was that although she was pregnant and legally married as an adult, she was 25, she wouldn't leave her husband as her family ordered to marry the cousin who had been selected for her. Her fathers and brothers swung bricks at her until she was dead. They had previously killed her older sister for 'dishonour'. Her husband admits he killed his first wife to be with her None of these men get prosecuted for murder as it seems to be legal to not only commit an 'honour' killing but also to nominate someone else to murder a wife, sister or daughter and then 'forgive' them. Why are we in the West giving millions, if not billions, in aid to Pakistan and Indiathis link is particularly nasty, warning, that is giving approval to their appalling culture, or at least ignoring that 50% of the country have no rights and can be raped or murdered at will. The head of one Indian State's political party said about rape, Boys will be boys. They make mistakes. Rant over.I had thought that Pakistani law was as much derived from British law, as Pakistan was part of India, as it was from Sharia law, but maybe not.So how does this relate to me wanting to read this book? I want to see what else in the UK, America and anywhere else is so peculiar but important. Not weird little laws like A special law prohibits unmarried women from parachuting on Sunday or she shall risk arrest, fine, and/or jailing. in Florida, but major, weird laws that as the title says, have shaped the world.",

            "An interesting, readable introduction to common law. Misleading title: should be Is killing people in order to eat them wrong, if you are really, really hungry?",
            "In all honesty, the book's title is what caught my attention, I mean the possibility that within the book's pages discussions regarding taboo questions resided was enough to wet my appetite. Upon close examination, however, I realized that this book was concerned not with the taboo, but rather with the social, historical, and cultural dynamics that shape common law. I mean why is eating people considered wrong? Why is racial segregation no longer practiced in this country? Who owns a fox? The person who chases it or the person who caught it? Those questions, or rather the factors that help answer such questions are examined in the book. The writer provides a well written, informative, and often entertaining look at eight important legal cases from English speaking countries that have shaped the legal system helping establish what is seen as proper under the eyes of the law. The book, furthermore, argues that common law is shaped by the efforts of people, constantly changes to adapt to changes in cultural and social values, and should be discussed not simply with the use of legal terms, but in a manner that can be appreciated by all members of a society. I really enjoyed the book, and while I had heard of some of these cases, the book wonderfully connects them together by illustrating how we shape common law through legal cases where our values clash and reach often difficult agreements of what we should consider wrong? So is eating people wrong? Read on or make your own mind through your mental courtroom. ",
            "Great introduction to different areas of law, tells the stories of key cases in an interesting way - would recommend to someone wanting to study law at uni",
            "Good, easy read. Title is taken from an English case R v Dudley and Stephens, involving a shipwreck, murder and cannibalism. In that chapter, the author observes that literature and the law impact each other in either direction. The facts of the 1884 Dudley and Stephens case closely parallels an 1838 novella by Edgar Allan Poe (The Narrative of Arthur Gordon Pym of Nantucket) Poe's tale is about four men adrift after a shipwreck who draw lots to see who would die and be eaten. The name of the loser ***cue creepy music**** Richard Parker, the very same name of the victim in the Dudley and Stephens case almost half a century later. The author makes an interesting and lively presentation of 9 other famous common law cases on varied topics (aboriginal rights, rule of law, the neighbor principle and others) including a where are they now commentary - not available in the law reports.I agree with the thesis that common law is a satisfactory, but messy process, for developing legal principles. His introduction and concluding chapters are brilliant expositions on this challenging subject.",
            "This book is surprisingly good. Written by York University Law professor Allan C. Hutchinson, it has a clear structure of 10 significant Common Law cases that impacted subsequent ones. These cases range from eating a fellow seaman to Brown v. Board of Education to the case that gave the Miranda Rights its name. I say the book is better than I thought because Hutchinson revealed a cynic side I had not expected. Instead of citing the popularity of these cases to their judiciousness, he instead credits their ambiguity (room for future cases) and intersection with the moralistic and political values of the majority. .As Hutchinson shows, in addition to demanding answers from society, laws definitely reshape themselves with it as well.For more reviews, visit me on Instagram @ RandomStuffIRead !",
            "An interesting introduction to the most ground-breaking legal cases for any would-be law student. However, there is far too much unnecessary background detail for my liking (for example, including the full name, birthplace and career of every individual mentioned). This sometimes distracts from the important information and makes the case harder to follow. There was also a slight overuse of flowery adjectives at points which made the reading a little clunky at times.I am also not a fan of the book's title. Yes, I understand it is meant to jump out at you, and that it does. Yet, cannibalism is just one of several cases and the theme in this book seems to be the Common Law. So, the title is somewhat misleading.Overall, was it worth reading? Yes, it was a nice collection of legal principles and had an appreciation for the social, economic and political context of the time."

However nothing is simple where the demigod Tempus and his band of fighters is concerned, at a whim of one god or other as they are.Some of the stories recount previous adventures, cunningly sculpted as a training tool for the younger Stepsons, and some are new, reminding the reader of why this series and this world are so exquisitely crafted. There is humour, albeit dark, love in many forms, loyalty above and beyond the norm, and of course a good helping of heroes - mythic and mysterious, dangerous and deadly but heroes nonetheless. These are heroes in the mould of Odysseus or Beowulf, and the tales bring the reader closer to our mythic past.The action starts early and does not let up, even for a moment, and the reader is drawn into the tempestuous world of war and its aftermath and is not for the faint of heart.

From the compiletely imagined universe surrounding this city, come mythical stories that heighten the courage of the characters and the ways they face their challenges. Led by Tempus, a mercenary general, you too would awaken to the call of mission and the harrowing risk of violence, even death: \u201cTempus\u2026 was knee-deep in the bloody purges marking the first winter of Theron\u2019s accession to the Rankan throne when the sky above the walled city began to weep black tears.\u201dArticulated knowledge of weaponry is seamlessly woven into the text, \u201cZip did what he had to do: let fly with a palmed dagger and then a specially pronged slingshot missile.\u201d Also, horse-riding is described in an intimate manner that puts you right there, in the saddle: \u201cThe file was a little out of control and his horse had to leap hot flames\u2026Men yelled and squirted water on themselves and their mounts as they let flaming arrows fly and urged skittish horses\u2026\u201dEvery character has a complexity: take Roxane, dubbed Death\u2019s Queen.

            "The Sacred Band is leaving Sanctuary just when that hellhole of a town needs defenders. A ragged thief named Zip leads a group of rebels against Sanctuary\u2019s invaders, yet he\u2019s unlikely to succeed on his own. Tempus has led his Stepsons and Thebans north, leaving Sanctuary to sink or swim on its own. Along the way, the Band tell each other tales of former exploits while contending with new and frightening supernatural adversaries such as the Sphinx. Wraiths visit Band members while they dream, bringing sickness and a sleep that won\u2019t end. Can Cassander, Band healer, aid his warrior comrades?This novel contains all our favorite characters while introducing new ones. I was pleased to see two female fighters join the Sacred Band. The stand-out quote for me in this collection was: \u201cNothing walks the earth more savage than a mare enraged.\u201d As an incurable lover of all things horse, this quote for me epitomized the deep understanding Janet Morris has of horses. Her novels contain many references to the use of horses in war, and bad things inevitably happen. Yet she deals with the subject in a sensitive and knowledgeable way, and without compromise. Her characters rely on their horses, love their horses, fight alongside their horses, and sometimes, watch their horses die. Her skillful word-weaving has me laughing, crying, despairing and triumphing along with them. You can\u2019t ask more than that from an author.Highly recommended by Cas Peace, author of the Artesans of Albia fantasy series.",
            "Grand new stories wrapped around canonical Sacred Band tales from Thieves' World(R). The Fish the Fighter and the Song-girl marks the gathering of all the Sacred Band of Stepsons stories not previously assembled in Tempus with his right-side companion Niko into one satisfying volume: the Fish the Fighters and the Song-Girl. Thank the gods! No more babying ancient paperbacks with crumbly pages or struggling with unwieldy, over-sized three-volume Science Fiction Book Club editions and tiny print. The Morrises are too respectful and too smart for that. The Fish the Fighter and the Song-girl is the second volume in a two-volume set of Sacred Band of Stepsons: Sacred Band Tales and these two volumes include every story of their Sacred Band that the Morrises ever wrote for Thieves' World plus many unavailable outside these compilations or hard to find. And did I mention that the covers and production values here are spectacular?As with the Tempus collection (Volume 1 of this two-volume set), the Morrises give us more than a collection of iconic old stories. The Fish the Fighters and the Song-girl begins with Tempus and his hand-picked personal guard lost in unknown country. Almost immediately, Arton, one of the youngest Stepsons, encounters a Greek sphinx in the woods. From there the action rockets. This frame story of the northward trek through an unexplored land introduces every other story, threading its way among old tales and new, and comes to its own surprising conclusion. We greet all the characters we've come to love and meet memorable new characters: Cassander, the McGuyver of the Sacred Band, lightly mentioned and introduced in the big SBS novel, The Sacred Band, the Song-girl herself, a fighting pair of Lemnian women, others... I won't spoil it for you. The book's title story, the Fish, the Fighters and the Song-girl is a tour de force, virtually free-standing, yet enhanced by what's around it. The plotting of the entire volume is intricate but never overpowering, enriching each story, old and new, as it frames it. And each old story has been revised and expanded, part of the Morisses' Author's Cut series of enhanced reissues. If you love the Sacred Band of Stepsons from Thieves' World(R) or from the Morrises' Beyond Sanctuary books, you'll be thrilled with this book. If you haven't read any of the other Sacred Band books, this is as good a place to start as any: you'll be mesmerized. I was. ",
            "As expected I was on the edge of my seat when the Sacred Band left the Sanctuary and not at the best of timing, just as they might have been needed to defended it against the rebels or against the inner strife. But the adventures that await Tempus' Sacred Band are as challenging, as breathtaking.My favorite fantasy series, this book was full of wonderfully vivid, complex characters and amazing descriptions of places that made me feel that I was right there, participating in the adventure.Great series that I highly recommend!",
            "Amazing Stories!This anthology is a collection of well-crafted, creative stories based on Greek mythology. The well-developed characters are memorable and the plots riveting and complex. This is a hard to put down book written by talented authors."

            "This book promises to present the information simply and, for the most part, it delivers. The author does neglect discussion of a percentage of the wine-producing world, but likely it is written for those shoppers who have access only to the wines from main wine-producing regions. (Some mention of lesser-known regions, and the qualities of those wines, would have at least acknowledged their existence.)Nevertheless, this is a decent starter guide to anyone who wants to know more about buying, tasting, and serving wine. Its discussion of wine production and what factors go into creating sweet vs. dry, red vs white, or light vs. full-bodied wines is presented without complexity and can be immediately applied to the more sophisticated explanation of grape varieties and wine regions. Particularly interesting is how climate, including variable night and day temperatures vs. steady temperatures, affect the end product. The writer assumes the reader might have never even ordered a bottle of wine in a restaurant, which is good, because he recommends the proper etiquette for doing so without sounding judgmental. (Clearly, he cringes when the entire table stops to watch the waiter uncork the proffered bottle.)Even more interesting is the advice on pairings. Of course, pairing wine and food takes practice, but the author gives enough information for the reader to begin experimenting, armed with the knowledge gained from reading the chapters about wine types and regions. Probably some failures await the beginner, but advice for what pairings to avoid is also offered. "

            "One of my New Year's resolutions for 2016 is to become better educated about wine, and this is the first of many books at my neighborhood library that I decided to pick up in that effort, mostly because I liked the idea of getting an insider's look at how to think about the subject. And it was a really informative and interesting read, I have to say, although I agree with what its critics say as well, for a book that has Sommelier's Guide right in the title, it's an awfully basic book, something right up my particular alley as someone who didn't know anything about the subject beforehand, but that will frustrate people who already have a handle over the basics and were looking for something that would teach them the sommelier-like nuances. Misleading title aside, though, this is a quick and interesting read, and as a fairly new book on the subject, I appreciated its concentration on the very latest of New World topics in the wine world, such as the rise of South American and New Zealand vineyards. Now, onward and upward! "

            "Oh man. SO GOOD.This fittingly colorful and exuberant picture book biography of Kandinsky is pitched just right for young readers. GrandPre captures the stunning, busy, dynamic quality of Kandinsky's art with astonishing panache. (Seriously, you just want to stare at these illustrations and let the colors seep into your soul.) Rosenstock's simple but deeply expressive text bursts with lively onomatopoeia, underscored by the changing typefaces. The author's note at the end reproduces some of Kandinsky's paintings and explains a bit more about his life, including how he likely experienced synesthesia.Not only is this a highly enjoyable biography, it's also a brilliant way to get kids thinking about abstract art: 'What's it supposed to be?' people asked Kandisnky. It's my art,' Vasya answered. 'How does it make you feel?' Pair it with When Stravinksky Met Nijinsky for a fantastic older-kid storytime about breaking creative barriers and the joy of artistic expression. "

            "Vasily Kandinsky's development as an artist and the struggles of both him (and many of his colleagues) to break free from the standard and appropriate (quotes are mine) dictates of what art, of what in particular painting was supposed to be, and this actually being the genesis of Expressionism, Cubism, Surrealism, of basically all abstract art in general, is glowingly and readably presented by author Barb Rosenstock in and with her brilliant and evocative The Noisy Paintbox. The featured and assumed fact that Vasily Kandinsky (and even though in The Noisy Paintbox, he is called Vasya, I will use Vasily as that is the first name with which I am most familiar) most probably had synthesia, that he not only saw colours as red, blue, yellow etc. but that each colour also had an audible sound for Vasily, that his paintbox basically sang and that Kandinsky thus actually was often painting the sounds he heard emanating from said paintbox, the hisses, the whispers, basically the music of art, all this is not only a wondrous and magical reading experience, the author's printed words, in conjunction with Mary Grandpr\u00e9's expressive and impressive accompanying illustrations not only show Vasily Kandinsky's life and his development as an artist, they also present the very essence of what made the latter such a novel and original painter, namely that Vasily Kandinsky was brave enough to break free, to use his synthesia as a tool, that he started to paint his emotions, the perceived colours he heard as sounds, as music. And even though Kandinsky's family and even society in general were often both critical of his art, his desires and also at first tried to mould him into being a traditional artist who painted only realistically (imitating the so-called Old Masters), Vasily (after he had abandoned his law career and moved from Moscow to Munich) finally took the necessary step and painted what he desired and yes, even needed to render, to produce on canvas, on paper, sounds, music, feelings, abstractions, colour as an entity in and of itself, colour as a symphony (a necessary step for both himself and Kandsinky's colleagues, his artist friends, who were equally frustrated by the dictates and mandates of needing to paint, to produce art that with realism was supposed to only represent pretty landscapes, still-lives, portraits). And while I do in fact absolutely love love love Vasily Kandsinky's work (his art, his stylistics, his expressively bold paintings), for me, personally (and this also comes shiningly through in Barb Rosenstock's narrative, in the text of The Noisy Paintbox), even more important is the fact that in many ways, Vasily Kandinsky should be feted and celebrated as not only a talented and pretty much amazing artist, but as one of the main movers and shakers who not only created abstract art, but really was the instigator, the midwife so to speak of modern art as a genre and the acceptance of abstract art as actual art, as a satisfactory form of the same.Now as much as I have indeed adored and appreciated the featured narrative of The Noisy Paintbox, for me, what really does make this book stand out and shine is the fact that Barb Rosenstock has not only included an informative and enlightening author's note (with appreciated and detailed source listings and suggestions for further study and research) but that she also has included four examples of Vasily Kandinsky's own work (so much better and also much more of an homage than picture book biographies of artists where, sadly, none of the artist's actual work has been included, which does seem to happen rather too often and frankly, I tend to find this hugely frustrating and annoying).And finally, with regard to Mary Grandpr\u00e9's accompanying illustrations, they are really, truly simply totally, absolutely spectacular, expressive, shiningly emotional, with a glorious sense of colour and composition, presenting, showing both Vasily Kandinsky's life story and also his oh so very much distinctive painting (artistic) style. In fact, Mary Grandpr\u00e9's imaginative renderings of the artist's works could, in my opinion, have been created by Kandinsky himself (and that is at least for me on a personal level, the very highest praise I can give, as Vasily Kandinsky is one of my favourite 20th century artists). And really (although I do appreciate the fact that The Noisy Paintbox won a 2015 Caldecott Honour designation for Mary Grandpr\u00e9, I am actually more than a bit miffed and disappointed that she did not win the actual Caldecott Medal (as I for one certainly do feel that Mary Grandpr\u00e9's illustrations for The Noisy Paintbox were and are vastly superior to the illustrations for The Adventures of Beekle which were awarded the 2015 Caldecott Medal).",
            "This illustrated biography about the life of the famous Russian painter of abstract art, Vasily Kandinsky, not only tells the young (or older) reader about his work, but also gives a simple introduction to the neurological condition Kandinsky possessed called synesthesia, where information meant to stimulate one sense can stimulate other senses as well. In Kandinsky's case, he experienced colors as sounds, and sounds as colors, hence the clever title!This book also includes copies of four of Kandinsky's famous paintings, an Author's Note, sources, and links to websites on synesthesia and abstract art.To be honest, I had never heard of synesthesia before reading this story a few years ago. My Grade 3 students (and I) found both the painter and his condition quite fascinating through this lovely Caldecott Honor picture book!",
            "Every single person sees the world in a different way. I learned that lesson early on. One of my brothers is color blind, which fascinated me to no end as a child. I bugged, hassled, and quizzed him every chance I got\u2014What color is that? And that? What about this? Haha\u2026.He refuses to answer any color related questions to this day because of me. :) The Noisy Paint Box: The Colors and Sounds of Kandinsky's Abstract Art tells the story of how Vasya Kandinsky saw the world and how abstract art came to be. Russian artist, Vasya Kandinsky could hear colors hum and play like the beat of an orchestra. Colors hissed, banged, and clashed in the air around him. With passion and power, he created that sound on canvas with paints, patterns, shapes and swirls. \u201cHe brushed a powerful navy rectangle that vibrated deeply like the lowest cello strings. He tossed up jagged swashes of blaring crimson and added cheerful dots of burbling green, clanging orange, and tinkling violet. Vasya painted and painted until the colors went quiet.\u201dThe illustrations and colors feel so alive in this book! The words and pages hold the magic and movement of paint strokes. Words swish, move and dance across the page! Perfect words like\u2014stomp, twirl and trill. I loved every word, color and sound. Ms. Rosenstock and Ms. Grandpre made me feel the power and wonder of the art.This beautiful book will inspire readers to learn more about Vasya Kandinsky and abstract art. But it also encourages readers of all ages to put their vision down on paper with words or colors. Even if some people can\u2019t see or understand your vision\u2014others will. Put it out there! Express yourself the way only you can. Go paint, draw, write, or scribble!  We all see and hear the world in our own way and that\u2019s what makes each and every day an adventure. A beautiful adventure.A biography, journey, and joy to read! Highly recommended.",

I appreciate how concise it is, it gets to the point directly, and is therefore powerful. I love the art, and I am glad to say that it makes me appreciate Kandinsky's own work more (which is why I read children's artist bios, but only sometimes do they succeed). And it reminds me of what I try to do when with children making art. I don't ask them 'what is it supposed to be,' instead I say, Please tell me about your work.",

Overall all the battles have improved a lot, and is actually engaging. Especially Jonouchi's battle show a lot of character growth. As the battles, set-up and character moments takes center stage, the plot takes a backseat. Thank god! Because it is still stupid. The major problem this book has, is that is it unbearably cheesy. Yu-Gi-Oh the manga was never as cheesy as the anime, but now we can see the anime's influence on the books. Battle city is shaping up to be a great arc! Maybe the best since Death-TMinor note, a former presumed dead villain returns to show that Yami wasn't that bad in the beginning.

Yugi also learns that the mysterious Marik is controlling Ghouls who are battling duelists and stealing their rare cards. Jonouchi faces off against a psychic duelists and actually proves that he's grown exponentially as a duelist. Other than a brief appearances of familiar Duelist Kingdom faces there wasn't much to this particular volume.

This shows how Jonouchi is becoming a better duelist in his own right as he can now happily fight his duels without the help of Yugi. It is interesting how duels like this one are slightly different from in the anime, but obviously has the same outcome.This volume was very much a set-up of the tournament and establishing Yugi and Jonouchi\u2019s place within it.",

Her claim to fame is the envy of every freak on the outside: she\u2019s the former lover of Ethan Wolfe, the killer who left more than a dozen dead women in his wake and nearly added Puget Sound State professor Sheila Tao to the tally. Now Abby, serving a nine-year sentence for slashing a police officer\u2019s throat in a moment of rage, has little human contact\u2014save for the letters that pour in from demented fans, lunatics, and creeps. But a new wave of murders has given Abby a possible chance for a plea bargain\u2014because this killer has been sending her love letters, and carving a message on the bodies of the victims: Free Abby Maddox. Jerry Isaac will never forget the attack\u2014or his attacker. The hideous scarring and tortured speech are daily reminders that the one-time Seattle PD officer, now a private investigator, is just lucky to be alive. Abby Maddox deserves to rot in jail\u2014forever, as far as Jerry\u2019s concerned. But she alone may possess crucial evidence\u2014letters from this newest killer\u2014that could crack open the disturbing case. With the help of Professor Sheila Tao, seasoned police detective Mike Torrance, and intuitive criminology student Danny Mercy, Jerry must coax the shattering truth from isolated, dangerous Abby Maddox. Can he put the pieces together before Abby\u2019s number one fan takes another life in the name of a killer\u2019s perverted idea of justice?A powerful sequel to Creep, with a fast paced, rollercoaster of a ride, twists that keep surprising you to the very end. Five stars.Thanks again Jennifer for this great book, now I hope you will keep your promise to do the Q &amp, A's for my group A Good Thriller on goodreads.com",
            "Freak is the follow-up standalone novel to Jennifer Hillier's debut: Creep and it's a whole new trip to crazy town! You will recognize all the characters but the feel of this story is much more detective fiction/serial killer thriller than the obsessive, psychotic love theme that was Creep.Freak was suspenseful, mysterious, stomach turning as many serial killer novels are, and an entertaining revisiting of all the characters that made Creep so engaging...well except one. He's mentioned often enough though. If you enjoy thrillers with similar themes, I strongly recommend both Creep and Freak. Check them out!My favorite quote:There's no end to the utter fuckery of the human race, pal.My review for Creep:https://www.goodreads.com/review/show...FAQ on Jennifer Hillier's website:Will there be a third book in the Creep series?Here's the thing. It's not actually a series. Creep and Freak are both standalones. While Freak takes place after Creep in the same fictional Seattle world, the books have different protagonists and different villains. The series designations that appear on a few retailer sites are confusing, and I've been working with my publisher to correct that. You can read my books in any order. Think of it like Thomas Harris's Hannibal Lecter books (and movies) - same world, same characters, but you don't have to watch Red Dragon first to enjoy the Silence of the Lambs or Hannibal. That being said, there is a possibility that I might one day write a new story starring some of the characters from Creep and Freak. I never say never. Okay, so I get that Creep and Freak aren't part of an ongoing series. But I'd still like to read your books in the order they were released.I totally get it. The upside to doing it this way is you'll get all the insider references I like to drop in each of the books. Plus, characters from earlier books often make surprise appearances in later books, which can be more fun if you've already met them.The release dates were:Creep \u2013 2011 Freak \u2013 2012 The Butcher \u2013 2014 Wonderland \u2013 2015",
            "After loving Jennifer Hillier's recent novels, Jar of Hearts and Little Secrets, I really wanted to check out her previous books. I listened to Creep, the first book in this series and really enjoyed it. I was excited to get my hands on this book next. While I thought this was a decent story, I didn't like it as much as Creep and it seemed quite a bit more gruesome. I did enjoy hearing from some familiar characters though. I thought the ending was a bit rushed and a few things were left unanswered. I'm wondering if there was going to be (will be?) another book in the series, which might be why things were left the way they were. Jennifer Hillier is still one of my favorite authors and I'm excited to see what she writes next. ",
            "DNF'd at 52% complete via audiobook. The writing was on point, as all Hillier's novels have been, but none of the characters were likeable, even Dr. Sheila Tao. In the first book of the series, Creep, I had no issues with Tao, but the fact that she was able to keep her job at the University, despite sleeping with her graduate assistant, really rubbed me the wrong way in this novel. It felt wrong to me, and almost as though the fact that she was a female and sleeping with a male student made it more acceptable. I also HATED the voice of Detective Jerry, it was overly gravily and felt like nails on a chalkboard to listen to..i just couldn't do it. I also pretty much had it figured out despite not finishing. I'm glad Hillier moved on to different subject matter after this one.",
            "Original book, Creep, was much better. This one felt like a repeat of the first, with some variances, and it was easy to see most of the twists coming. Overall, my opinion is it would have been better to stick with one novel.",
            "There is going to be a reckoning for author Jennifer Hillier someday. One day, when her days are up on this mortal plain, she is going to have to answer to the dark gods with whom she made a deal to get her incredible writing powers. That's the only answer I can come up with for how she writes such gripping, approachable, moving and bold fiction. I'm an avid reader of many genres, modern crime or psychological thrillers, are not within those categories of 'personal favorites'. Yet when it came to FREAK, I did not read it for a review, I did not read it because it was assigned to me, I did not pick it up as soon as I could because anyone wanted me to. I read it purely because I loved CREEP so much. What Hillier does in this sequel is nothing short of breathtaking. Whereas CREEP was a story of madness, murder and the undefeated human spirit, FREAK is one of calm control, of inevitable outcome, of logic versus cunning guile...and then of madness and murder. From the start we know what's coming. The reader spends the entire book right with the characters of Jerry and Sheila. We scream at them, beg them to run away from the madness of (soon to be legendary) villain Abby. But like us, they are powerless against the forces amassing. Like us, they know right from the start, Abby Maddox is in control. They stumble blindly through a series of grizzly murders, red herrings and personal drama that distracts them, and the reader, from the bigger picture. The bigger picture? We're all just a moment away from madness, either in ourselves or in the very real possibility of the people around us. I was skeptical when I heard Hillier was writing a sequel to CREEP. I was unsure she needed to continue the story left off with Dr. Shelia Tao (the most flawed yet relateable protagonist in the history of modern fiction)seeking rehab for her sex addiction and Abby Maddox taunting her from afar. But Hillier, another example of the most wonderful people being able to write the most horrible things, pulled together a master story that lays the groundwork for what could be even more in this series or, at the least, a strong sophomore entry into a burgeoning career. In CREEP it is Tao's secrets that lead her down a dark path of destruction only after her lover, Ethan Wolfe's, own secrets come out. In FREAK, there are no more lies and secrets from our heroes. No more ducking about to hide anything. In this story, our villain has all the secrets, and in that way, all the power. It's an odd feeling of helplessness that stands in stark contract to the first book. As a reader, we didn't realize the power we had with our character's perspective. We were with Tao, strengthened by her will to survive, be it through attempts to protect her career, or flat out trying to stay alive. But now, we're all in this together. And 'they' hold all the cards. I'll leave this review with this thought. What is most bothersome about FREAK is that while the horror of CREEP takes place mainly in dark alleys and locked basements, FREAK's nightmare unfolds in hotels, jail waiting rooms, TV interviews. There is light, there are witnesses, there is hope and there is a strange feeling of security that is only mildly undercut by a knowing feeling of dread. We're never alone in Hillier's world, yet we're always vulnerable, we're always a target. We're always a potential victim. Well done Jennifer Hillier. If you have the number of those dark gods, shoot it my way. ",
            "The tagline that drew me to this book was, What if Hannibal Lecter had been a woman? Harris should sue over that. Lecter was a complicated character who managed to be almost likable despite being terrifying. Hillier's Abby is crazy-- the two have that in common-- but she lacks charm. She is manipulative and other characters fall for her beauty, but as a reader I never once liked or admired her. I didn't hate her. I was just bored by her. I knew immediately which character would be her suprise accomplice, and the two psychologists in the book knew less about human behavior and mental illness than an undergrad who's taken Abnormal Psych. The quality of the writing is mediocre at best.I also want to note that this book plays into the crazy, sexually manipulative bisexual trope. Lecter's queerness didn't read as insulting because he was a fully-developed character whose sexuality was independent of his madness, whereas Hillier's Abby reads as a stock character-- and an insulting one at that. ",
            "Excellent book. I will definitely be on the look out for the second one."

Born in Muslim Spain, he has become famous in the West as the greatest mystical thinker of Islamic civilization. He was a great philosopher, theologian, and poet.,William Chittick takes a major step toward exposing the breadth and depth of Ibn al-'Arabi's vision. The book offers his view of spiritual perfection and explains his theology, ontology, epistemology, hermeneutics, and soteriology. The clear language, unencumbered by methodological jargon, makes it accessible to those familiar with other spiritual traditions, while its scholarly precision will appeal to specialists.,Beginning with a survey of Ibn al-'Arabi's major teachings, the book gradually introduces the most important facets of his thought, devoting attention to definitions of his basic terminology. His teachings are illustrated with many translated passages introducing readers to fascinating byways of spiritual life that would not ordinarily be encountered in an account of a thinker's ideas. Ibn al-'Arabi is allowed to describe in detail the visionary world from which his knowledge derives and to express his teachings in his own words.,More than 600 passages from his major work, al-Futuhat al-Makkivva, are translated here, practically for the first time. These alone provide twice the text of the Fusus al-hikam. The exhaustive indexes make the work an invaluable reference tool for research in Sufism and Islamic thought in general.",

            "And say: 'My Lord, Increase me in knowledge Qur'an 20:114. As this book has walked with me throughout my first year as a Muslim, that verse has become my prayer, and Ibn Al-Arabi has very much been a Sheikh and guide in the faith. Two key words in the title of this book are Knowledge and Imagination. Chittick interprets imagination according to Al-Arabi as designating the intermediary realm between the spiritual and corporeal worlds. But sometimes he means existence per se. Throughout, the distinction between nondelimited imagination (existence as such) and delimited imagination (the imaginal world) becomes of vital importance when referring to transcendent concepts. As to knowledge, it is more excellent than love, which is why God commanded His Prophet to seek increase in it from Him. It is identical to the divine friendship whereby God takes charge of His servants and ennobles them. Through knowledge they come to know that He cannot be known. (380). Islam is the religion of knowledge. Knowledge is often described as light, and there is no knowledge manifested in the universe but that of God. God is in all and through all. Ibn Al-Arabi talks of God/not-God in the sense that the cosmos are manifestations of the divine - reflections of God. God is in all we see, all we do, yet not God in that the creation is not the Real in its essence. We can know God through the divine names or attributes that are mentioned in the Qur'an. But this concept of not-God is where the ego inserts itself - through created free will and our ability to step away from the divine law. Put another way, Al-Arabi states that we cannot BUT worship God as all is God behind the world of forms. Yet the mistake of him who associates others with God is that he devises for himself an original form of worship which God did not set down for him in a law, so he worships something he has created. (350)Hence why Chittick carefully addresses how much Ibn Al-Arabi emphasizes the sacred law. God will take a different form for every individual being, a different manifestation, a different attribute, but the common reference points are the Qur'an and Sunna (which contain the divine law). These comprise the foundation of both the human and the cosmos. The book is divided into eight main sections: 1. Introduction (to Al-Arabi's life and an intellectual history of his work in Islam as well as the West)2. An Overview of his thought3. Theology 4. Ontology5. Epistemology6. Hermeneutics7. Soteriology8. ConsummationIbn Al-Arabi is known as The Great Sheikh in Sufi circles, and is also known as one of the primary expositors of the doctrine of Tawhid or Oneness of God. He places great emphasis on the Islamic concepts of veils between us and The Real, both through describing the veils, and how they're removed through self-disclosure of The Real, which is accomplished through the knowledge of the attributes or Divine Names.  This is a book which requires effort to internalize and/or study, but the effort is nowhere close to what it would take to individually research the canon of Ibn Al-Arabi's work. Chittick has done the English-speaking world a huge favor by compiling the thought of this great Sufi into an accessible format, which is incredibly rewarding for the reader.",
            "you get the ore knowledge",
            "One of the most insightful books I have read on Ibn Arabi's school of thought. It is going into my Foundation shelf. I will probably want to return to this continuously throughout my life. There are passages in the book that demand you to put the book down and return to it later, which is one of the reasons why it took me 4 months to read. There are many metaphysical philosophical questions that are answered in this book, and it sheds light on the argument for God, and the Reality of the world in which we reside. The Incomparability and Similarity of God relative to the Cosmos is explained brilliantly throughout, as well as Man's relationship to the Divine side of God and the Essence of God. Questions dealing with non-existent objects and their relationship to the Divine which makes them manifest are answered and explained thoroughly. If you are a student of knowledge and want to understand the subtleties having to do with the deep questions about God and certain seemingly paradoxical quandaries that arise when thinking about the existence of the Cosmos, yourself, and God, then I highly recommend this book.

            "It is amazing to me that someone as inspired as Ibn Arabi ever lived and it is almost equally amazing that there is someone like William Chittick living during our time who is brilliant and perceptive enough to translate his work. This is a difficult book to review, but to put it shortly it is a book about contemplative knowledge \u2014 the necessary counterpart to the ratiocinative knowledge that most people are familiar with. It took me about a year to read it, portion by portion, but in sum it was very rewarding. Ibn Arabi famously said that his works were given to him whole by God, rather than being the outcome of some course of research. Reading his bewildering, inspired thoughts, I genuinely believe him.This book is one meant to be experienced rather than read in the normal way. It is the product of Ibn Arabi's gnostic experiences, which were geared towards the attainment of divine knowledge. The Path of Knowledge is in contrast to the path of love famously associated with Jalaludin Rumi. To call Ibn Arabi brilliant would somehow be inapt and I don't expect he himself w0uld desire to be referred to as such. The truer compliment, one that he would be more likely to recognize the wisdom of, would be to say that he did not exist. Rather he was a man who has annihilated in the Truth and in the knowledge that he sought and attained. I am grateful that we have this book, the result of a heroic effort by Chittick to translate and interpret Ibn Arabi's The Meccan Revelations. I hope there will be people in the coming generation able to translate and make accessible more of Ibn Arabi's writings.",
            "If your into mysticism of any kind this is an amazing read. Dr. Chittick was my religious studies professor at Stony Brook. I was lucky to have him guide me through the text. His office hours were usually filled with students sitting around, drinking black tea, and discussing Ibn-Arabi's powerful interpretations of Islam. I wish I could have bottled the experience and sold it but that would have been heresy! ",
            "The book itself is a translation of portions of Ibn Arabi's al-Futuhat al-Makkivva by William Chittick. It comprises 329 pages of closely spaced double columns which don't make for easy reading. Plus there are also extensive notes and several indexes, making a grand total of 478 pages.Chittick arranges Ibn Arabi's text along with his own notes to make clearer certain concepts that Ibn Arabi uses throughout his other works. It is certainly a deep book for those who are more serious about not only Ibn Arabi's work, but that of many others of his ilk. It explains many concepts not easily found in English elsewhere.A test for me is to say: Would I read it again?, the answer has to be yes, because though it was definitely not easy reading, frequently requiring re-reading many passages several times to extract a fuller meaning, it is a book that operates on the principle of what one puts into it, bears fruit according to one's labors.",
            "This was of seminal importance for me. Mysticism has always interested me. My Granfdather himself had mystical prowess. This book gives an insight into the inner world of the mystic. Obscure at times, it is also a very rewarding read. For the very simple reason it gives you an insight into the philosophy of a saint. Ibn Arabi brings a new dimension to mystical understanding. His theosophy is dominated by his concept of the Divine Names and at first I could not really see the rationale in entifying these Divine Names, to the point where he gives credence to the idea of manyness which I felt was contradictory to the concept of tawhid in Islam. But having read the book I have come to realise that the perspective of mystic will not always be understood by the common man. Ibn Arabi's thought processes are not bound by logic or common sense and some of his opinions may seem at variance with orthodox beliefs. An example is when Ibn Arabi validates idol worshipping by asserting that pagans were simply trying to construct a body which personified their concept of God. Like many Sufi's the disregard for logic and reason echoes repeatedly throughout this book. Unlike Ghazali, Ibn Arabi does not really try to use logic to validate his beliefs. In fact part of the problem of unravelling his thought is due to his efforts to describe concepts that can not be ideated. But the very fact that he tries at all is the reason why this book is worth reading. Ibn Arabi actively affirms the existence of possibility and the introduction of barzakh in his philosophy is fascinating. A depository of possibility in which exist entities yet to be realised within existence. Equally intriguing is his revelation of hadith that I had not ever heard of. A difficult read but an essential one for anyone who wishes to glimpse an insight into the mind of a Sufi master",
            "Every teacher knows that a classroom full of students represents as many different receptivities for understanding the subject matter as there are individuals, whatever may be the reasons for the discrepancies in aptitude...Being is One, and It discloses Itself to all things in Its Oneness. Each receives Being's self-disclosure to the measure of its own capacity...In the following passage Ibn al-'Arabi explains the important role played by preparedness in the context of addressing the practical problem of why prayers are often not answered...God says, The giving of thy Lord can never be walled up Koran 17:20. God is saying that He gives constantly, while the loci receives in the measure of their preparedness. In the same way we say that the sun spreads its rays over the existent things. It is not miserly with its light toward anything. The loci receives the light in the measure of their preparedness. The person with a cold temperament enjoys the sun's heat, while the person with a hot temperatement suffers from its heat. In respect of its essence the light is one, while each of the two people suffers from what the other enjoys...The sun blackens the face of the washerman, while it whitens the clothing. The sun whitens the clothing because of the clothing's preparedness, while it blackens the face of the washerman. In the same way, with a single blowing of air a person extinguishes a lamp and ignites a fire in tinder, but the air itself is one. A single verse from God's Book reaches the listener as one entity. One listener understandings one thing from it, another listener does not understand that thing but understands something else, while a third understands many things...Once you understand this, you will know that the gift of God is not withheld. But you want Him to give you something that your preparedness cannot receive. Then you attribute the withholding to Him in that which you seek from Him, and you do not turn your attention toward the preparedness."

            "He spoke at the Lahore Literary Festival a few days back at the launch of this book. When narrating how he had to tape his eyes over for a few weeks to write about a character who was going blind, he said something along the lines of:But you understand why I had to do it? I had no choice. I couldn't ask all those intimate questions of a blind person. I had to live it.Very understandable but only a little way into the book, I could not shake off the feeling that something was amiss. Going over the volume another time I discovered it was the message inadvertently embedded in its textuality: the book is not written for me. It is written for a Western audience.Exhibit A: She looks out of the window, past the low rosewood bough from which a sheep is hung every year to be disembowelled and skinned just minutes from its last concious moments, to mark the Sacrifice of Abraham. It's called Bakra Eid and there is no reason to be so apologetic and over explanatory for it especially since it has no bearing on the plot. Any appearance of vernacular language is meticulously translated and there aren't many to begin with. All characters speak with the same voice which has zero regional influence and some details are inaccurate (12 buttons in one rupee, seriously?). All of this would not have been a problem if the chief claim of the book wasn't that it helps in understanding this complicated country. 'I think first of the subject matter and then the characters and plot which would facilitate in addressing it', Nadeem Aslam claimed at the Lahore Literary Festival. And this is exactly where he faltered. Reading this book felt like I was eavesdropping on a conversation I wasn't a part of.Living in Pakistan during those times is perhaps as complicated as the loss of sight. Although there is no rule preventing a writer from addressing what is not directly experienced but literature, despite and because of being self validating carries the burden of proof. Aslam could not address Pakistan even armed with piles of research. Perhaps, he had to live it. ",
            "When I finished reading Nadeem Aslam's MAPS FOR LOST LOVERS I felt as if I'd lost a friend, so I downloaded THE BLIND MAN'S GARDEN. The prose is gorgeous in both books, but less dense here and I prefer that. THE BLIND MAN'S GARDEN is the story of the war in Afghanistan as viewed by a cultured, middle-class family in Pakistan. We meet all sides, the medical student son who just wants to take care of the wounded. The young wife he leaves behind, his father, a good, decent man whose religion means everything to him. Jihadists who use their religion as an excuse to torture and kill. War lords who sell innocent boys to the Americans as jihadists for $500. The Americans who take care of their prisoners even as they torture them. I was gripped by what was happening to these poor people until in the last 50 pages Mikal, the clever character, does something so irredeemably stupid and travels around the countryside without a plan. I understood the structural reason for it, but didn't believe that clever character would do that. If anyone reading this has read the book, please let me know what you think."

            "This is a complex book, filled with complex emotions. Nuanced doesn't come close to describing its portrayal of fundamentalist Islamist fervour and the various forces and interpretations within Islam that in many ways define it, and also attempt to balance it ultimately ineffectually? not sure, but in the end, must simply survive it.The same nuance and complexity emerge with respect to the use of torture, the oppression of women, or just about any other issue raised in this novel of post-9/11 Pakistan / Afghanistan, seen through the eyes of a constellation of characters who must navigate, often blindly, (and both literally and figuratively), through the inherent conflicts of their own beliefs, relationships, and realities in the world around them.A central conundrum - the prevailing dynamic - is the clash of religions and, more broadly, cultures which both cause the conflicts, and ultimately also provide the only tools to endure, if not resolve, them. This book forced me to confront a lot of my own assumptions, emotions and attitudes - and I'm left holding these thoughts in each of my hands and different parts of my brain, irreconcilable. At the same time, as jo points out in her exceptional review, although there is much that is disquieting and even rage-inducing, there is also the intense beauty of the writing and imagery, and especially, the Mikal character's unswerving goodness and sense of justice. This book is sometimes overwhelming, always challenging, and probably not for everyone. It is a test of tolerance and empathy, in many ways. The beauty of the writing, the power of the imagery, the essential force of goodness that drives (again, literally and figuratively) the action in the character of Mikal, is the reason I've given it five stars.",

The kind of book where you don't stop to feed yourself or answer the phone, where you just wander from bed, to couch, to chair...occasionally changing the locale of your reading. If I read a book like this every couple of years, I consider myself really lucky.Blind Man's Garden is set in post 9/11 Pakistan and Afghanistan. It's the story of one family and their struggle to survive hardship and loss while maintaining their humanness. If you're a Muslim-hater, this book isn't for you, (unless you're willing to take a look through the eyes of a different culture, someone not like you). That being said, Blind Man's Garden isn't anti-American (or pro-Muslim). It portrays reality. It shows atrocities committed by both sides rooted in fear of the enemy, the challenges of women once used to relative freedom now trying to contend with wearing their jewelry hidden under black robes, husbands afraid for their wives to leave the home, lest they be stopped by the religious police, the fear of angering a neighbor who might tell lies about you to the authorities. I likened it to Nazi Germany with different trappings. It shows that caught up in all the politics, there are everyday people, laughing with their husbands, hugging their children, eating meals together...just people. It's not a political book, but a book about PEOPLE.If you read Khaled Hosseini's And the Mountains Echoed, and are feeling sad at the prospect of waiting 5 years for his next book, your wait is over. This book is AT LEAST as well written, the story more smooth in my opinion. It's beautifully written. If you don't like descriptive writing, steer clear. The author must be a gardener, because I smelled the orange blossoms, felt the bark of the henna trees, and saw the hedges of jasmine vine. The bad thing is it's a library book and I have to return it. The good thing is Nadeem Aslam has three other books for me to read. Blind Man's Garden is just superb. Really amazing. I can't recommend it enough. 10 stars. ",
            "Having read each of Nadeem Aslam\u2019s previous novels with great enjoyment, I bought this one in hardback almost as soon as it was released. His novel Maps for Lost Lovers \u2013 which took Aslam ten years to write \u2013 I\u2019ve read twice and it remains one of my favourite modern novels. Aslam\u2019s last novel The Wasted Vigil which is also set in Afghanistan \u2013 I enjoyed \u2013 but found the message ultimately hopeless, I wondered therefore what this one would be like. Having read Aslam before I knew I wasn\u2019t in for a comfortable ride \u2013 it wasn\u2019t, but it is definitely worth it.Nadeem Aslam\u2019s fourth novel is often brutal and sometimes angry, but totally unforgettable. Aslam\u2019s often poetic writing is rich in imagery and deeply poignant. Weaving together the political and social realities of Pakistan and Afghanistan, with the tragic story of a family deeply and irrevocably affected by the war which comes in the wake of 9/11, The Blind Man\u2019s Garden is ultimately, a story of hope and resilience.\u201cIf love was the result of having caught a glimpse of another's loneliness, then he had loved Mikal since they were ten years old.... This almost-brother. This blood-love in everything but name.\u201d Jeo and Mikal are foster brothers from a small Pakistani town, together they decide to go to Afghanistan, following the terrorist attacks in the USA, to care for wounded civilians. However there are malign forces at work against the pair, and their good intentions soon put them both into harm\u2019s way. Left behind are Jeo\u2019s wife Nadeem, secretly in love with Mikal, and Rohan, the father who brought them up, slowly going blind, and haunted by the memory of his dead wife. \u201cHe walks out into the garden where the first few lines of moonlight are picking out leaves and bowers. He takes a lantern from an alcove. Standing under the silk-cotton tree he raises the lantern into the air, looking up into the great crown. The tallest trees in the garden are ten times the height of a man and even with his arm at full stretch Rohan cannot extend the light beyond the nearest layer of foliage. He is unable to see any of the bird snares \u2013 the network of thin steel wires hidden deep inside the canopies, knots that will come alive and tighten just enough to hold a wing or neck in delicate, harmless captivity.Or so the stranger had claimed. The man had appeared at the house late in the morning today and asked to put up the snares. A large rectangular cage was attached to the back of his rusting bicycle. He explained that he rode through town with the cage full of birds and people paid him to release one or more of them, the act of compassion gaining the customer forgiveness for some of his sins.\u201dAlso left behind are Basie, Mikal\u2019s elder brother and Yasmin his wife, Rohan\u2019s daughter. They teach at a local Christian school run by Father Mede \u2013 which some Islamic zealots wanting to make a name for themselves, have their eye on. At another local school \u2013 Ardent Spirit \u2013 the sinister Major Kyra and his saluki hound stalk the rooftop watching the town and mourning the loss of his own brother in Afghanistan.Set against the backdrop of the superstitions and strictures of a small town in Pakistan, and among the wilds of Afghanistan, The Blind Man\u2019s Garden takes the reader on a terrible journey. The war is seen from many perspectives, those left behind, those caught up in a war they don\u2019t believe in, the war lords and the American soldiers, and the women for whom the world is uneven and narrow. Nadeem Aslam tells a story that sometimes makes the reader want to look away, it is a story of terrible events coming out of misunderstanding and suspicion. There are faults on each side, Aslam unflinchingly portrays the Islamic zealot, the war lord, the American soldier and the misguided follower realistically \u2013 beliefs fuelled by hysteria and propaganda leading to savage acts of war. ",
            "The Blind Man's Garden is a multi-layered book of great complexity which deals with issues of culture, family and religion in a manner to help the reader understand the delicate nature and intricacy of the web these themes create in our world. I am thrilled to discover Nadeem Aslam, the second Pakistani author whom I have fallen in love with this year. Like Exit West's author Mohsin Hamid Aslam write wonderful prose which must be savored. Aslam begins the book:History is the third parent. As Rohan makes his way through the garden, not long after nightfall, a memory comes to him from his son Jeo\u2019s childhood, a memory that slows him and eventually brings him to a standstill. Ahead of him candles are burning in various places at the house because there is no electricity. Wounds are said to emit light under certain conditions\u2014touch them and the brightness will stay on the hands\u2014and as the candles burn Rohan thinks of each flame as an injury somewhere in his house.And that is where I was hooked. As if in a garden Aslim sprinkles the book with images of butterflies, flowers and birds. Do not be fooled by the beautiful prose, this book packs a powerful punch and contains suspense which will have you on the edge of your seat.The story is set shortly after 9/11 at the beginning of the invasion of Afghanistan. It is told through shifting perspective of a number of complex characters and moves back and forth between Pakistan and Afghanistan. Rohan is the blind man of the book, he is a retired Pakistani teacher who still mourns the death of his wife Sophia many years before. Other characters include his daughter in law, Naheed and foster son Mikal, among others.Jeo, Rohan's son, a doctor in training and Mikal travel to Afghanistan to treat the wounded in the new war:The door has opened and both of them have entered the future. Jeo sits in the back of the van with Mikal as they are driven through the shadowland of hill and plateau, the use of headlights kept to a minimum so that at times there is no knowing what lies a mere five seconds into the darkness. Later in the night lightning appears overhead and illuminates not only the earth and the clouds but also the place in the mind where the line of fear crosses the thoughts, and the ground glows blue for a few seconds with a crystal immediacy, vistas opening up as in a vision, with black shapes looming in them, shadows perhaps, perhaps creatures who can be fought only with the weapons forged by the spirit, not the flesh, and then as the night deepens the stars come out and wheel overhead, smearing the sky with ancient phosphorescence.From that early moment in the book everything becomes suspenseful and I found that I couldn't put the book down. It's impact is powerful and I debated between a 4 and 5 star, but I'm sure it will make my top ten of 2017, so it seems it needs to be a 5 and I couldn't put my finger on what might bring it down."

            "Joan Farrer, \u201cRemediation: Discussing Fashion Textiles Sustainability\u201d pp.19-33p.20 \u2013 One of the most cohesive description given more than 20 years ago by Bruntland was that \u201csustainable development is development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs\u201d (Brundland 1987). At the latest count and rising there were 70 different definitions of sustainability (Holmberg and Sandbrook 1992). What do 70 plus definitions of the meaning of sustainability mean for practitioners in the fashion industry now? Which one of these 70 definitions and counting, affect the way we think about how we make and use clothes? p.21 \u2013 \u201cGreen waste\u201d is dumped upon other countries as any waste would be, and where the disposal of the waste at the source of consumption is not the responsibility of that country. Dumping fashion clothing on more than 65 overseas countries is eroding their local fashion textiles industries and creating profit for those few agencies handling the waste, whether private commerce or registered charities. The major source of the problem in achieving a sustainable fashion industry is the consumer. Fashion customers are hungry for goods, yet need to feel absorbed from the responsibility of the constant refreshing of their wardrobe, this is also a physical problem rather than philosophical one. The clothes are traded from the back of the charity shops and warehouses and sold by weight to fashion textile customers primarily in the second-hand clothing industry, to be dispersed across the globe. UK educational organizations too are supporting sustainable design networks such as Textile Environment Design (TED), the Textiles Futures Research Group (TFRG) and the Slow Textiles group, and degree courses such as the BA Eco Design at Goldsmiths, University London and the MA Sustainable Fashion Design at the Centre for Sustainable Design. London College of Fashion, University of the Arts London (UAL) and the University College London Department of Anthropology are all producing items or publishing on the reasons behind and solutions to the problem. p.27 \u2013 The fashion industry epitomizes unsustainability with its fast changing trends, high minimums and planned obsolescence, contributing millions of tonnes of clothing to landfill, incineration and third world dumping. One solution is to ReFashion \u2013 a process that intercepts discarded clothing (post-consumer textile waste), reclaims, re-cut and refashions, returning the item to the clothing stream, effectively creating a new loop, postponing its grave ending, this reducing both textile waste and the demand on raw materials required in the manufacture of new textiles. p.31 \u2013 The multiple sources of fashion textiles production coupled with the enormous number of definitions of sustainability mean that there are too many variables in creating a sustainable fashion and textiles sector in mass market terms. It is a Utopian ideal. For instance, a limitation to the wider adoption of sustainable philosophies in the sector is related to the cost of more sustainably produced products from accredited supply chains with an integrated product policy. A polarization is taking place in the fashion textiles industry (Farrer and Fraser 2009) which means that there is an opportunity for an alternative sector to emerge from co-creator of generation C, where a political message is being delivered to makers and users developing new kinds of business models for distribution and sales. Small-scale business in this arena is producing fashion clothing design which is artisanal and underpinned with craft skills, where the handmade and its \u201cone-off\u201d idiosyncrasies are celebrated. These garments are becoming \u201csustainable fashion badges\u201d worn by an educated consumer who wears the small-run commercial or handmade garment as a political flag in order to rail against the unsustainable industrial fashion clothing system in the developed world. ReferencesBrundland, G. H. Our Common Future: World Commission on Environment and Development. www.worldinbalance.net/pdf/1987-brund... (1987)Holly McQuillan, \u201cZero-Waste Design Practice: Strategies and Risk Taking for Garment Design\u201d pp.83-97p.83 \u2013 Prior to recent advances in technology \u2013 most notably the internet \u2013 social and industrial uptake of changes in clothing trends occurred more slowly as information took longer to travel across the globe. In the contemporary world the combination of cheap production of textiles and apparel, and the rapid distribution of fashion trends have led to an industry that can respond rapidly to changing social mood. Fast food is successful because it removes the need to decide on, purchase for and then prepare a home cooked meal \u2013 it is convenient and cheap. However, the impact of this food production and consumption model on the environment and human health is not reflected in the price at the counter. The same can be said for fast fashion \u2013 the advantages of this model of clothing production and consumption are convenience and low cost \u2013 but like food, it also carries enormous environmental and social impacts. p.86 \u2013 A key concept of cradle-to-cradle design is that we need to eliminate the concept of waste. Not merely reduce waste or down-cycle waste, but to design waste our of the equation and to ensure all components of any product fall into a technical or biological nutrient cycle. p.96 \u2013 Fast fashion is a system that taps into our desire for change and fulfils it at a price point we can easily justify spending our hard earned or borrowed money on. We need to design new fashion systems, which fulfill this desire for flexibility and change but which do not impact on our environment and society so severely. Jana M. Hawley, \u201cTextile Recycling Options: Exploring What Could Be\u201d pp.143-155p.149 \u2013 On many street corners in developing countries, racks of used clothes from developed countries are being sold. The US exports nearly US$1 million annually in sales to Africa. One of its primary export countries is Uganda, where Ugandi women can purchase designer blouses for less than a dollar. Most rag dealers in developed countries sort used clothing for the various markets in developing countries in other words, lightweight clothing and sturdy shoes would go to sub-Saharan Africa, and men\u2019s and children\u2019s clothing would go to India, but women\u2019s clothing would not because women in India still primarily wear traditional dress. The sorted clothing is compressed into 272-450kg bales, wrapped and warehoused until an order is received for export. Several things are considered when sorting used clothing: climate of the market, relationships between the exporters and importers, and trade laws for used apparel. Recent negotiations between the US Department of Commerce and East African countries (Uganda, Kenya and Tanzania) resulted in a 300 percent import tax. Kate Fletcher, \u201cPost-Growth Fashion and the Craft of Users\u201d pp.165-175p.165 \u2013 In order to bring about change, sustainability values and experiences have to be real to people. Yet we know very little about people\u2019s everyday encounters with fashion and sustainability. For instance, how does it feel to wear a garment that connects us with others? What is our understanding of engaging with nature through the clothes we wear? p.170 \u2013 In the last two decades the intellectual framework that has most shaped sustainability work in the fashion industry (as in most other sectors) is lifecycle thinking. Simply, it involves directing attention not only to fibre type, material provenance or the processing stage that a company deals with directly, but also to the whole physical lifecycle of the product, from raw materials to end of life. It sees garments as a mosaic of interconnected flows of materials, labour and as potential satisfiers of needs and not simply as isolated resources, processed or sources of one-off environmental, social and cultural impact in production. Lifecycle thinking is inspired by the language and study of ecology and works to understand the countless interrelationships that link material, industrial and economic systems with nature. These connections operate at different scales and with different spheres of influence, some on a direct local level and others globally. In lifecycle thinking, openness to these relationships is a key precursor for change as it demonstrates the dynamic effect of each part on every other. The goal of this \u201cglobal\u201d view is to optimize the sustainability of the whole product \u201csystem\u201d and for this to take a priority over increasing the effectiveness of individual system parts or lifecycle phrases. ",
            "Most of the book was about using sustainable resources and maintaining garments in a sustainable way. The part of the book that reviewed the actual design/pattern making process was a grand total of 7 pages (two of which were full page photos of a garment in the process of being draped on a mannequin.)The mathematics and methods for using the process mentioned were not even fully explained. This book was a thorough disappointment."

            "This is the last volume collecting the twenty years of team-ups with the Justice League of America from Earth-1 and the Justice Society of America from Earth-2. There is some silliness here, but it was a lot of fun to read them again after many years.The first tale involves the JLA and JSA being targeted by the Ultra Humanite and his new gang of villains. Apparently, he has learned that if ten heroes are banished to limbo, five from each earth, then all heroes will be erased from one of the earths --- forever! The UH, though, knows it will be Earth-2 that will be hero-free, but needs villains from Earth-1 to help out. So he's very duplicitous about the entire situation. Eventually the villains from Earth-1 learn they have been duped, and end up helping the heroes rectify the situation. It's not revealed how this all works, or why it doesn't happen when heroes die a natural death, or why these particular ten heroes. The whole plot doesn't make sense, but it's still fun to read, and art is provided by George Perez and John Beatty, so it's definitely nice to look at.The second team-up last for five issues: three from JLA and two from All-Star Squadron, a book dedicated to the World War 2 adventures of DC heroes (not just Justice Society members). The first eighteen issues of that title are collected in B&amp,W here: Showcase Presents: All-Star Squadron, Vol. 1. This includes the two issues collected here, but it didn't have the three issues from JLA, so a lot was missing when reading it. The basic plot is that Per Degaton, always messing with time, has caused the US and USSR to go to war in 1961 over Cuba, resulting in nuclear holocaust on Earth-Prime. Along the way, the Crime Syndicate from Earth-3 is freed from their prison in limbo and they provide some assistance as well as treachery along the way. The JLA ends up going to the past to figure out what is happening, and they end up meeting the ASS. Eventually, all three teams defeat Per Degaton and the timestream is repaired.The JLA issues were drawn by Don Heck, who has never been a fan favorite. I hated his work when I was a kid, but have developed an appreciation for it now. The ASS issues were drawn by Adrian Gonzalez with some great Joe Kubert covers. Gerry Conway wrote for the JLA and Roy Thomas was the writer on the ASS.Shortly after this team-up, the JLA went belly up and devolved into the deservedly maligned JLA Detroit, which destroyed the JLA as a unique concept and the annual JLA/JSA team-ups. This series has been a lot of fun to read, but it's too bad DC, when faced with poor sales on the JLA book, didn't get rid of Gerry Conway and try a new writer. Conway drove the book even further into the ground, until it was canceled around the time of Legends. A sorry end to a once-great book.",
            "#118 - Crisis on Multiple Earths Vol. 6 by Gerry Conway, Roy Thomas, George Perez, Romeo Tanghal, et alThe final book in this series of collections, and it wraps up with not just extended stories (one three-parter, one five-parter) but a harbinger of things to come by way of an mini event crossover between the Justice League book and the relatively new All-Star Squadron book written by Roy Thomas.The first story has a convoluted plot launched by the Ultra-Humanite (mad genius in the body of a mutated ape, as opposed to Grodd, who's a mad genius ape with telepathy, or Monsieur Mallah, who's a beret-wearing gay French ape with a brain in a jar fetish...but I digress.) This chaotic plot spans three issues, in which U-H recruits a bunch of bad guys from Earth-1 and Earth-2, with the purpose of capturing ten assorted heroes and chucking them into limbo, at which point reality is supposed to reset and wipe out all of the superheroes on one or the other world. Said scheme goes just swell...until it does. Heroes are sprung, bad guys are punched, reality snaps back, and we're done for another year. Whoo to the hoo, yip yip.Then it's on to the final Crisis Crossover, piling up the JLA, the JSA, and the All-Star Squadron in not one, not two, not three, but four time periods (there may, in fact be more), and not one, not two, but three parallel worlds (plus another visit to limbo, a shout-out to Earth-3, and a boot to the head and one more for Jenny and the wimp.) Plus altered timelines!That's because it's a Per Degaton story, even though it includes the Crime Syndicate of Earth-3 (those familiar with the shenanigans in these annual crossovers know them of old, they come from a world without superheroes, where crime is the main pursuit in life or something like that.) Per Degaton, meanwhile, is a lowly lab assistant with big ambitions who steals access to a time machine in 1947 and tries to rewrite history to his specifications. His repeated efforts at this usually leave him with bad dreams, deep confusion, existential dread, and, I kid you not, having to wash test tubes yet again (this is a running gag with Per Degaton stories. America Vs. The Justice Society (Jsa by Roy Thomas has this gag repeat four or five times by the end.)Somewhere in there, of course, Per gets his clock cleaned and his army of leather-suited thugs punched into next week, last week, and a time share in Mexico. You can understand the desire to punch Per in the head repeatedly until he just ends up Groundhog-Daying test tube cleaning day -- this time around he manages to wipe out an entire parallel Earth in a nuclear holocaust (and he isn't even there when it happens) and he causes Earth-2 to be stuck with 1940s fashions and designs for forty years.It's purest hokum, delivered by a couple of experts in the art of writing hokum, but it's a lot of fun (well, for the most part, the implication that bad guy Brainwave, in the first story, uses his powers to repeatedly rape an actress is pretty horrible.) I'm not sure there's going to be all that much repeat value here, but I have too much to read anyway.",
            "DC Comics Presents Annual #1: When I bought the box set that this volume is included within, I was expecting that all the Earth-1/Earth-2 crossovers were going to be included, right back to the first meeting of the two Flashes that started that whole multiple earths concept running. So this story of two Supermen meeting was what I thought would be in these volumes. But this is really more like just a teaser or a prelude to just the annual meeting of the JLA from Earth-1 and the JSA of Earth-2. Nothing particularly special here although it does feature the first story in these collections written by Marv Wolfman, one of the masterminds behind the coming Crisis on Infinite Earths. Justice League of America #207-209 &amp, All-Star Squadron #14-15: This 5-part crossover was crazy! Time Travel. Multiple Earths. Alternate Realities. Variant Histories. Nuclear Apocalypse. World War II. The Cuban Missile Crisis. FDR. JFK. Nazis. Soviets. Justice League of America. Justice Society of America. All-Star Squadron. Crime Syndicate. Per Degaton. I think my head is still spinning. Unfortunately, even with all this going on, this story still fell just a bit flat. While it\u2019s a good and entertaining read, it just a bit too much like all the lame stories from the previous volumes of crossovers. The progress from the previous volume just now seems like some quirky high points, with qualities that were not repeated (at least until Crisis on Infinite Earths). Justice League of America #219-220: Wait? Hold on a tick? Are you seriously trying to tell me ...? This was horrible! And these characters are supposed to be heroes? Forcing people to believe lies about their own lives? Marvel did something like this once (anyone remember Avengers #200?) and it was appalling. What where they thinking? And why didn\u2019t some editor at some point stop this misogynistic trash from being printed? It\u2019s bad enough in the last story when the female character serve refreshments after the male characters finally decide to stop behaving like spoiled toddlers, but this bit of ret-con is downright offensive. Justice League of America #231-232: As this last story was written by Kurt Busiek, I had some pretty high expectations for it. Sadly, these were not realized. This is just another typical JLA/JSA team-up that ends up with the cliche of punching the bad guy for the win, even when said bad guy is some cosmic force that has shown it can control its own shape and density. Yawn. Might makes right and willpower conquers all are not the best slogans to live by, but these are common threads that DC seems to keep coming back to again and again. In the end, this was just another disappointing story concluding a rather disappointing volume. ",

You can understand the desire to punch Per in the head repeatedly until he just ends up Groundhog-Daying test tube cleaning day -- this time around he manages to wipe out an entire parallel Earth in a nuclear holocaust (and he isn't even there when it happens) and he causes Earth-2 to be stuck with 1940s fashions and designs for forty years.It's purest hokum, delivered by a couple of experts in the art of writing hokum, but it's a lot of fun (well, for the most part, the implication that bad guy Brainwave, in the first story, uses his powers to repeatedly rape an actress is pretty horrible.) I'm not sure there's going to be all that much repeat value here, but I have too much to read anyway.",

            "The last volume of these Crisis on Multiple Earths tales. I really enjoyed this volume, more than some of the others. The stories within this volume were different and interesting but still held the same familiar tone as the previous crossovers. I LOVED the first story in Justice League of America #195-197 and how different it was. The villains had the upper hand for most of the story! It did create a little bit of inconsistency at the end but I really enjoyed the change. The second story was HUGE! Within the pages of Justice League of America #207-209 and All-Star Squadron #14-15, there was not only the JLA and the JSA but also the All-Star Squadron (a team that I had not read about before) AND Per Degaton, a time traveling villain! My only introduction to Degaton was the first season of Legends of Tomorrow and that version was totally different. I was glad of the opportunity to read about characters that I hadn\u2019t before and see them team up with more familiar heroes. Also glad that these volumes gave me a good glimpse of the JLA and JSA teams between the years 1963 and 1983. ",
            "If you are a fan of Superhero team ups then here is a awesome collection for ya. Very nice stories and art. Good read. Recommended",
            "This kind of thing really isn't for everybody, but I absolutely adore it. The first story is a bit by the numbers, but it's got some fun concepts that may have laid groundwork for the big reboot, but the big plus is George Perez's magnificent artwork. The second story unfortunately lacks Perez, but gets absolutely insane by taking timeline tampering and universe hopping to new extremes. Silliness and wonder make for a great cocktail. ",
            "Two stories I remember well from my favorite Justice League period. Still, the official description for this edition is so wrong everywhere I see it. 1) It's the Ultra-Humanite, not Gorilla Grodd, leading the Secret Society. 2) There's no third story featuring the Crime Champions.I'll post a real review eventually, but I had to mention these two errors in the description, which seem to also appear on Amazon and BN.",
            "Two of the later JLA-JSA crossovers from the pre-Crisis era. The first, featuring the Secret Society of Super-Villains, has a great setup but a confusing climax and so-so finale. The second, and my favorite of the two, is a slightly complicated tale of time travel plus multiple Earths, featuring the villain Per Degaton. (B+)"

            "A Canyon Guidebook that Informs and Illustrates  From Elves Chasm and Whispering Springs, to Havasu Canyon and Deer Creek Narrows, the book weaves in and out of the Grand Canyon delighting with glimpses for those like me who've not yet experienced the canyon first hand. This book will not inundate you like a textbook. It is a simple guide to the predominant features that a traveler can see when visiting the canyon. It describes rock formations and points of interest, as well as flora and fauna that are to be found around the canyon. And it illustrates all of this with myriads of high-quality photo art. The illustrations are much clearer and more extensive than in many guides.It also briefly covers a variety of issues with current scientific theories about the formation of the canyon, and explains the Creationist point of view that the canyon was formed rather recently from catastrophic action, rather than slow sedimentary action. An example of this is in the fact that the creation of the Scablands in Washington, which was originally thought to be similarly created over millennia, was ultimately proven to be the result of the 'Spokane Flood' in a short catastrophic act. Passages in the Bible adorn the photos and illustrate how the Bible correctly describes the water cycle ages before it was understood by Science. I recommend this for those looking for a guide to the Grand Canyon. It is a nice sturdy hard-back edition."

            "If you visit the Grand Canyon you'll get plenty of evolutionary information. You get that everywhere, really. This book presents another way to look at the canyon and see evidence of a global, catastrophic flood. I found it fascinating and well-presented.",
            "We read this before our family's trip to the Grand Canyon. A wonderful description of the formation of the canyon from a biblical perspective. The photographs were fabulous and the essays were really well written. Great charts and other visual aids. I think this would be best for grades 6-9.",
            "Grand Canyon---A Different View was complied by Tom Vail, and contributors include John MacArthur (Author of The MacArthur Study Bible) and Ken Ham (Founder of The Creation Museum). Both are trusted authors in our home, and I was excited to see them listed as contributors to the book. John MacArthur's rebuttal to the Big Bang Theory was simple and accurate: If you don't believe in the Book of Genesis, then you are left with the incredible notion that nobody times nothing equals everything. In reading this, I was reminded that we are all in need of having our eyes opened so we can, as the psalmist states, see wondrous things from God's law. I thought too of the English martyr, John Bradford, who when seeing a criminal going to be executed for his crimes, uttered There, but for the grace of God go I.One of the great aspects of the book, is that it clearly lays out the evolutionary thought process, and then challenges the logic with both Biblical and Scientific evidence. One example is in on page 30 where the author explains how, for the evolutionist, the river has been the primal force in the formation of the the Grand Canyon. As he goes on to explain though, prior to the building of the Glen Canyon Dam, the river had been transporting 500,000 tons of sediment in a single day. If the river supposedly did take 70 million years to erode the Grand Canyon, where did all that sediment material go? In the pages following, he explains how for a creationist, the Grand Canyon was built after or perhaps during the catastrophic event of Noah's Flood. Such massive flood waters would have easily cut through the canyon. The sections are kept simple and don't dive too deeply into any one topic, but they give an excellent springboard for further research if desired.The photos are definitely one of the most noteworthy features in the book. The photographer did a magnificent job of portraying the Grand Canyon from many perspectives. Since most of the readings in the book are on the more challenging end, in my mind this is what most kids are going to be interested in! Photos include those of the basement rocks, water-eroded hollows, fossils of nautiloids, Marble Canyon, and Tapeats Sandstone in Carbon Creek. I gazed in awe at a photo depicting a lightning storm in the canyon and photos picturing streams rushing downward over gorges. Kids and adults alike are sure to find this book a treasure trove of awe inspiring scenes.MasterBooks has many wonderful books out that can be used for reference as well as pleasure reading. Although the book is small, it is the type that would great for a coffee table type display as the readings were short, (most were only a page or two), and the pictures lovely, thus making it possible for a reader to peruse a little, without starting on a full length reading drive. The Grand Canyon---A Different View is another fine book that will be used in our home not only for educational purposes, but for pure enjoyment.*Thanks to Master Books, a division of New Leaf Publishing Group for providing a free copy to me in exchange for my honest review.",

            "This book sums up a huge portion of the mechanisms underlying systemic racism. It details in plenty of depth how we have shifted to color-blindness in law amid local variation in policy (depending on concentrations of Black people) to create massive race-based injustice systematically. Worst of all, it makes fairness a way to impose suffering. Most telling, this book shows that this shift has been worst since Clinton caved to the Republicans on Welfare Reform, making the current system solely racial, independent of party. Oakland CA and Detroit MI are as likely to be systematically racist as is a city in AL or MS. By sticking only to the research they have done, both statistical and qualitative, the authors make a case that is hard to forget. "

            "Take it Like A VampBy: Candace HavensPublished by: Entangled Publishing, LLCReviewed by: Kelly H.I loved, loved, loved this book! It was a fun, quick read which I had a lot of trouble putting down.It was filled with interesting and entertaining characters which were incredibly hard not to fall in love with (and a few in hate with), and it left me totally wanting more. With characters like the totally hot (although a little dumb in the girlfriend department, at times) Nick \u2013 who I may love just as much as Eric Northman -- his equally hot and charismatic buddy Linc, the sweet, yet strong Casey, her ex-Uncle, now Aunt Teddie, and the evil witch Alvinia, I was absolutely hooked. As I finished I thought, Candace Havens should soooooo make this a series! I would totally read more books about Nick and Casey and this supernatural world she\u2019s created!Another aspect of this novel I enjoyed was the romantic part. Not only were there a few hot and sexy scenes, which I always love, the love story itself, was very engaging and very believable. Ms. Havens established that Casey and Nick were already very good friends right from the very beginning and I feel it made their falling in love completely plausible, authentic, and unrushed. Finally, I found the book incredibly funny. The things the characters say to one another and the thoughts that went through both Casey and Nick\u2019s minds were hilarious. Also, Ms. Havens added several references to current pop-culture, supernatural movies and TV shows \u2013 True Blood, Twilight, and Lost Girl, to name a few \u2013 and they often added to the overall hilarity of the thoughts and conversations which ensued.Without a doubt, I would recommend this book. It was absolutely wonderful and that\u2019s why I gave it five out of five stars.Disclaimer: An eBook copy of this novel was supplied to me for review by the publisher and everything I have said is of my own honest opinion. I have not been paid to review this book.",
            "Rating: 3 out of 5.Nick and Casey have been really good friends for the past few months. Both are crazily attracted to one another, the only thing keeping them apart is Nick's secrets.And he has a lot of them.I didn't like the one last secret that came out with regards to the evil other woman. I found that his justification for keeping that secret was lacking.But overall, the novel was funny and engaging.ARC Courtesy of NetGalley and Entangled Publishing, LLC.",
            "Sweeter than honey This was my first experience with this author and I found myself lost in her story. The alpha males are super protective, just what I love in an alpha male, and the story was interesting, intense and filled with so many layers that supported and enhanced the storyline. I think my favorite part was Casey. She is super sweet and excepting of everyone\u2019s differences with a backbone of steel that has her standing up for what she wants and not letting anyone take advantage of her twice. This character really made the book, and I can only hope that the author gives us glimpses into her future in the rest of the books in the series. Although if the leading lady in the next book ends up being her friend she might be a star all on her own. Regardless, I can\u2019t wait to see what happens next. ",
            "Read for ReviewOverall Rating 4.25Character Rating 4.50Story Rating 4.00First thought when Finished: What a deliciously fun read for a hot scorching afternoon! :)What I thought of the Characters: I loved the characters in Take it Like a Vamp! Nick was the smoldering hottie that we, aka me, wished really did live next door. He is kind, sweet, protective, and a little over-bearing at times (every good alpha is *sigh*). Casey, to me, is who stole the show though. She was talented, smart, and get this AN AVERAGE SIZED gal with gumption. She had some meat on her bones, some insecurities, and was loyal to a fault. She would help out anyone who needed it! Last but least, my Linc! He is Nick's best friend and HOT, HOT, HOT! This had better be a series because I'm ready for the next book (it had better feature Linc)!What I thought of the Romance: The chemistry between Nick and Casey is evident from the beginning and feels very organic. I love friends to lovers romances--they are the best! Their attraction just jumps off the page at you and doesn't feel forced! I felt that their personalities fit each other and that made the smexy better! I love when the main leads fit---different enough to keep each other on their toes but share enough in common that you can see a friend base there.What I thought of the Story: Overall the story was fun, light, and perfect for a lazy afternoon read. It was easy to devour in one setting! There was a little action, a little smexy time, a little fun, and all around a good love story!Final Thought: I will be waiting on book 2! "

            "The problem of mermaid stories is their predictability. There is only a handful of concepts of making such a story ( either Andersen or Splash or Lovecraft's Dagon). This makes them boring, despite the fact that mermaid as a symbol is rich of meaning. Subsequent problem is distinct antropocentrism that is entailed by Andersen model of mermaid stories, as well as some myths and folktales - mermaids are, sometimes literally, poor souls that need salvation occuring by becoming human via unconditional love for some human schmunk.....Mrs. Gilfillan story evades some of these motives..In her cosmos human is no more in the centre than marinians (mermaids and mermen)...thus Haley can choose her path and even try to combine both ways....Transcending humanity is not seen as limiting oneself, or as something wrong.....And proposed vision of love is the one that is liberating.....Though one can still have some doubts as to whether such love is possible....Neverthelees ,even as a fairytale it is beautiful....

This edition of the book will walk you through all of this material using the same readable approach as was found in previous editions. Rest assured, you'll find detailed coverage of Language Integrated Query (LINQ), the C# 2008 language changes (automatic properties, extension methods, anonymous types, etc.) and the numerous bells and whistles of Visual Studio 2008. What you'll learn Everything you need to knowget up to speed with C# 2008 quickly and efficiently. Discover all the new .NET 3.5 featuresLanguage Integrated Query, anonymous types, extension methods, automatic properties, and more.

It reveals the underlying radical coherency of his view of the world - from his enormously influential attacks on America's role in Vietnam to his perspective on Nicaragua and Central America Today. Chomsky's challenge to accepted wisdom about Israel and the Palestinians has caused a furore in America, as have his trenchant essays on the real nature of terrorism in our age. No one has dissected more graphically the character of the cold war consensus and the way it benefits the two superpowers, and argued more thoughtfully for a shared elitist ethos in liberalism and communism. No one has exposed more logically America's acclaimed freedoms as masking irresponsible power and unjustified privilege, or argued quite so insistently that the \"free press\" is part of a stultifying conformity that pervades all aspects of American intellectual life.",

            "Reading this book was an affirmation of an established principle of mine. If you vehemently disagree with someone, read their book and make an effort to understand their thinking. Then make up your mind.Chomsky is generally dismissed as an iconoclastic far-left gadfly, an academic who veered far off course from his primary area of expertise, linguistics. You will not find a kind word about him in National Review or possibly even in mainstream media.Notwithstanding, and coming from this traditional conservative/libertarian, Chomsky is extremely intelligent and knows how to frame an argument. Many of the essays in this book were written more than 40 years ago. His comments were quite prescient. The problems he identified still remain. He is one of those intellectuals that you may disagree with but whom you would never, ever want to debate. He is simply too well-read and informed.This book probably deserves a 4.5 but admittedly, my own biases prohibited me from bestowing this. Neverthess, a most worthy read.",
            "In all the reviews I've read of Chomsky's work I have yet to see a valid rebuttal of any of his points, which corroborates all of the fury, outrage and shame I always feel upon reading him. There's simply no refuting the facts he lays bare through his tireless research and exhaustive articles/books.Vital is the word that most comes to mind to describe the man and his work. It is absolutely vital to us as U.S. citizens firstly, and secondarily to the rest of the world's inhabitants. The man is a national global treasure and I'm already ruing the day he is no longer with us. Those will be some Grand Canyon-sized shoes to fill.I've only ever read Necessary Illusions (see my review) and this covers more ground, perhaps more superficially, and probably recycles some of that material -- but can you read this stuff too many times? Really you need to re-read and re-read once again, until it becomes ingrained, until you can recite this stuff, until you wake up with it every morning and go to sleep with it every night, because none of it should ever be forgotten. We need to always keep in mind just what kind of world we're living in. Whose world, I should say.My favorite parts were the Responsibility of Intellectuals and the Central America sections. If you can only read one essay from the whole book you should make it Intervention in Vietnam and Central America: Parallels and Differences, which encapsulates nearly everything important he has to say about the two continents in addition to the Cold War, U.S. foreign policy, and propaganda.Sure his writing is dry -- the only real criticism anyone can make of him -- but getting hung up on his writing is batshit insane if you stop for even half a second to think about the content he's presenting. Seriously people, what is important here: the continual, systematic slaughter of millions of innocents by the world's greatest superpower, or the fact that the only guy writing about it doesn't make it flashy enough?In recommending Chomsky, I don't really care if you read this one or not. Sure, why not? It's as good a place to start as any. Some people have said his interviews/speeches are more accessible, so maybe start there. Just read something of his, for god's sake, because this stuff needs to be common knowledge already.Not Bad Reviews.@pointblaek",

            "You know, I hate to say it, but Chomsky's a bore of a read. Sure, it's hard to argue with his tirelessly researched positions, but he doesn't command engagement from the reader, either. I feel like Chomsky's theses are rehashed in response to each new current event, compiled in each new book. I might like to read a book by another author discussing his positions, just to read his ideas from a different voice, you know what I mean?",
            "The Chomsky Reader is my first foray into Chomsky's thought. The book is made up of essays concerning Political Philosophy and Current Events. I didn't know a lot of what Chomsky talks about, so this book is infuriating. My take on foreign policy is that we should look at our issues first. I believe that being a World Police is ridiculous. We can barely solve our problems.This book is excellent. My only issue is that the subject matter made me angry.",
            "An interesting fellow. Some topics I'll have to study more (I have a page of titles lifted from the notes section, and a bookmark in the notes section that just says everything on this chapter.)Very interesting examination of twentieth century events, particularly involving U.S. wars and indigenous economic improvement. Also a couple chapters on mind and language.If you're not firmly welded to the idea that your own country has to be seen as the great Goodguy by all, it's quite illuminating. Raises some interesting Cold War points (essentially, each superpower pointed to the threat of the other superpower as an excuse to justify its own local grabs at power.) A major theme is that ideology is shaped to the benefit of those in power (which does not mean those in elected positions.) Ideologic blinders are so pervasive as to be invisible to those whose decisions are molded by them.Perhaps my favorite point in the book is in the first part, the interview. Chomsky asserts that regular people really are smart enough to understand and judge world political situations, that it requires merely the degree of sense shown in any detailed discussion of sports, but they do not do so because the system is not set up for them to have much decision-making power, so those interested in using their minds are inclined to limit that to fun things such as sports. This reflects my own belief that intelligence is mostly a matter of interest.Well worth reading and thinking about. "

            "The positives of this book are that it really picks up towards the end to an impassioned and educated plea to preserve wildlife habitats in the face of human caused turmoil. My favorite parts are when the stoic scientist gets very descriptive and emotional about the gorillas and the volcanoes. I have admired George Schaller since he appeared as a character in Peter Matthiessen's The Snow Leopard, where his aloofness and dedication to observation of sheep appealed to me. He is indeed a hard-working scientist, and this can be seen in his obsessive dedication to observing the gorillas in the Congo, Ruanda, and Uganda. I really admire the guy.I was put off by his descriptions of the Africans, which smacked of intellectual condescension and arrogance. This was released in 1964, when racial tensions were high, and his lofty attitude towards his guards and helpers is clear. He seems so compassionate towards gorillas and mountain flowers, but is quite judgmental when it comes to his own intellectual and behavioral standards for his fellow human being. As he says, But then man has never learned to treat his own kind with compassion.I learned many interesting things about gorillas in this book, and have added the Virunga Volcanoes to my places-to-visit bucket list, but the most interesting part was getting a glimpse into the inner workings of a great researcher.",

            "There are very few Arthurian retellings that truly make me feel sorry for Guinevere/Gwenhwyfar. I'm not entirely sure that this is one of them, but it made me cry, so perhaps it must be. It's a painful read, this last book of the trilogy. Gillian Bradshaw spares the reader no pain: these aren't legendary characters, but for the space of reading, real people, and I grieved for their hurts and mistakes and the way they got swept away in circumstances. I'm not sure I liked Gwenhwyfar and Bedwyr, by halfway through the story, but I pitied them. I even grieved over Medraut's death, when he heard of Gwalchmai's death.(There are no spoiler warnings on this, because I judge that the deaths of Medraut and Gwalchmai are well enough known that it would be a bit like putting a spoiler warning on something about the eruption of Vesuvius and the destruction of Pompeii. I've seen people request one, but it seems ridiculous to me.)Bradshaw's retelling is a powerful one, and it brings the characters to life. It's also a painful one. I don't find much hope in it, despite the epilogue. The Light goes out at the end, trampled under a cavalry charge.",

Also, unlike the others especially the first, this story includes no overt magic: the only lingering traces are the acknowledgement near the end of the presence of Gwalchmai's 'magical' horse of the Sidhe and his unearthly sword, both introduced in book 1 but not playing a part in this volume.As the story opens Gwynhwyfar is worried about the problems building up at Camlann (Camelot). The end of volume 2 saw the ominous situation when Medraut (Mordred), Gwalchmai's younger brother and a reputed sorceror, arrived at Camlann and began to undermine the unity that Arthur had established with such effort. Gradually, the fact that Medraut is the child of incest and that his father is Arthur (ignoring the fact that Arthur was tricked by the sorceress Morgawse, as he didn't know she was his half-sister), begins to come out through Medraut's whispering campaign, alienating the support of allied kings and some of Arthur's own followers.Medraut's insinuations also target his older brother Gwalchmai, and armed conflict breaks out as Arthur's 'band of brothers' begin to split into factions and individuals from each side fight duels over Medraut's accusations. Gwynhwyfar only succeeds in driving a wedge between herself and Arthur when she resorts to drastic action by poisoning Medraut's wine at a banquet, unsuccessfully. Gwynhwyfar's role puts her under immense pressure: she is, in effect, head administrator of the camp with the responsiblity for making sure everyone is fed and clothed and that there are supplies of everything needed by several hundred people. This, together with the emotional angst from her estrangement with Arthur, drives her into the arms of his right-hand man, Bedwyr. (In this retelling, there is no Lancelot, presumably because his character was developed in Medieval French songs and literature, and therefore was not an original component of the Arthur legend.)The rest of the story is more or less as per the Arthurian legends with all the tragic fallout. The story itself is so well known that the interest in reading an Arthurian novel is in the way the author develops the characters and makes the story understandable in human terms, despite its unlikely elements. For me, the hopeless affair of Gwynhwyfar and Bedwyr failed to convince. Their behaviour came across as a sort of lovelorn teenage angst. The fact that they both knew it would lead to the destruction of everything for which they had worked, as well as the terrible betrayal of someone they loved - Arthur - and had even been warned of such by Gwalchmai, made their behaviour unbelievable. As previously developed - Bedwyr features even in the first novel - both are noble, self sacrificing people. Yet to continue their affair when Bedwyr has already had to fight a duel to deny the rumours spread by Medraut only makes sense if both are selfish - which we're told they are not: they just can't help themselves. In younger people, this might have been believable but Gwynhwyfar is thirty-eight, well into middle age by the standards of the period, and Bedwyr, who must be about the same, has previously shown deeply held religious beliefs as well. They might have lapsed once, given Gwynhwyfar's low ebb at Arthur's rejection, but to keep on doing it when the situation is escalating into obvious danger - Medraut and his gang watching their every move - doesn't add up.The other problem with the book is its deadly dull pacing for the first three quarters. It dragged and was an effort to read, more or less from the outset. It only picks up when the two lovers are caught and even then, really only at the point where Gwynhwyfar escapes to Arthur's camp after her conscience drives her to accept the punishment she feels she deserved for her betrayal. The final 100 pages or so are much better paced and have some good confrontation scenes with Medraut and his followers, plus the unfolding of one tragedy after another. The short Epilogue has a tacked on feel, as it attempts to show there is still one ray of hope against the darkening which followed the loss of the dream of Camlann. The book was heading for a 1-star review, but its final quarter means that overall it has earned 2-stars."

            "Rating: 4* of fiveThe Book Report: The last days of Camelot as narrated by Guinevere. Arthur lost in battle, Gawain and Mordred at daggers drawn over the death of Gawain's beloved son, death comes for all in the epic Battle of Camelot...Guinevere dies to the world by becoming a nun, and later the abbess of her nunnery. In this book, Guinevere's rupture with Arthur comes because she dishonorably attempts to rid the kingdom of horrible Mordred, not because she dallies with Lancelot. Frankly, I like this version a whole lot better because it makes internal sense to me, being the way I would expect Guinevere to have behaved based on her established character. Guinevere then reflects on the crash-and-burn of her hopes and Arthur's to save some small corner of the world for Roman knowledge and enlightenment. She sees, at the very end of her life, the Irish monastic ark that preserves a tiny fragment of Classical culture for the ungrateful future, and rests herself easy at last.My Review: This is a reissue of the 1981 YA title that formed part of Bradshaw's first major commercial success. I got the book as part of the Goodreads First Reads program.Bradshaw uses the Britonized spellings of the well-known characters' names: Gwynhwyfar, Medraut, Gwalchmai, none of which I felt comfortable with until about halfway through the book. She has a real gift for the characterization of these people, unlike some Arthurian follow-ons. She makes each of the people who come forward in the narrative into a very real presence. It's a lot of work to make a character consistent internally, but she does it, and despite the fact that she didn't have to because the characters are already so well-known. This is book three of a trilogy. Frankly, it shouldn't matter much if you read them in order because I assume you're at least passingly familiar with the legend on which the books are based. Still, in order, the books are Hawk of May as narrated by the eponymous Gwalchmai or Gawain, being the story of his rebellion against his terrible mom Morgan le Fay/Morgawse, and service to her detested bastard half-brother Arthur, Kingdom of Summer, the tale of Gawain's penance for seducing the daughter of a king he was on Arthur's embassy to, and the death of his rotten mother at the hands of his big bully brother, finally this book.",
            "Oh dear....it's all over. All 3 books consumed and done. It was a pretty wild ride! And to think she wrote this trilogy by 26 at best! Absolutely a great new take on the Arthurian legends and absolutely one of the best executed versions as well. A fabulous writer. I tend to have prejudice against Gwenhwyfar, myself, and this third book is from her viewpoint, I have read it and feel perhaps less annoyed by the general character than I did.Highly recommended to Arthur fans :)",
            "If you know Arthurian lore, then you don\u2019t need to worry about spoilers in this review because Gillian Bradshaw\u2019s In Winter\u2019s Shadow is the definition of by the book. This final installment in her Arthurian trilogy feels like it belongs to an entirely different series than its predecessors. Hawk of May told the origin story of Gwalchmai ap Lot, better known as Sir Gawain. Kingdom of Summer gave us a similar coming-of-age treatment of Gwalchmai\u2019s servant, Rhys ap Sion. But although the action in Kingdom of Summer was filtered through Rhys\u2019s narration, there was no doubt that Bradshaw was telling Gwalchmai\u2019s story and using his family to represent the conflict between Light and Dark. Considering that the source material has been around for centuries, there have been comparatively few stories focused on Gwalchmai/Gawain, which makes Bradshaw\u2019s decision a refreshing narrative choice.Spoilers to follow.In Winter\u2019s Shadow follows the pattern set by its predecessors and introduces a new narrator, Queen Gwynhwyfar, to show us another side of court. The problem is, it\u2019s actually a side Arthurian fans have seen all too often: the love affair between Gwynhwyfar and Bedwyr, a stand-in for Lancelot. There\u2019s nothing wrong with retelling a classic story\u2014we wouldn\u2019t know about King Arthur today if the legend hadn\u2019t been rewritten over generations\u2014but there needs to be something new, some reason why readers shouldn\u2019t just pick up White or Malory. Substituting Bedwyr (Bedivere) for Lancelot and Gwalchmai\u2019s son Gwyn for his brothers Gareth and Gaheris is not a substantial enough change. Bradshaw\u2019s previous novels found that reason in Gwalchmai, but he\u2019s an ancillary character here.What if he hadn\u2019t been? The relationship between him and Gwyn far outshines the one between Gwynhwyfar and Bedwyr. So does the relationship between him and Medraut, which is mostly off-screen here. I can only imagine what they talked about for hours after Gwyn\u2019s death. It makes me wonder what could have been if this novel had been narrated by Medraut, someone who obviously would have a different view of Arthur\u2019s court than the previous narrators but is more closely related to Gwalchmai\u2019s story than Gwynhwyfar. It would have been daring but perhaps too at odds with Bradshaw\u2019s dichotomy of Light versus Dark (a supernatural conflict that is almost entirely neglected here). As it is, having Gwynhwyfar as narrator dilutes the brothers\u2019 relationship and makes Gwalchmai\u2019s last words and Medraut\u2019s tears at his death feel unearned.Bradshaw\u2019s adherence to legend leads to some contrived character choices. The ostensibly wise Gwynhwyfar and Bedwyr come off as incredibly stupid for not ending their affair\u2014likely because it didn\u2019t feel like an affair of passion. Bradshaw does a fantastic job setting up the conditions for the affair without villainizing anyone, but she has a harder time showing (not telling) why Bedwyr deserves this unconditional love. This discrepancy is at its worst after Bedwyr accidentally kills Gwyn and begs Gwynhwyfar to run away with him. Her decision to follow him to Less Britain (France) makes political sense, but the ease at which she forgives him for Gwyn\u2019s death really makes her character come off an less sympathetic. It ties into one of the more questionable themes of In Winter\u2019s Shadow, that it is intent, not outcome, that matters. I\u2019m not sure that applies when you kill an unarmed teenager in a move that singlehandedly results in thousands of deaths and societal collapse. But, so as not to impose modern morals on medieval works, we\u2019ll say manslaughter wasn\u2019t as serious an offense in sixth-century Britain.That still begs the question of why Bedwyr had to recuse Gwynhwyfar in the first place\u2014why she didn\u2019t simply ask to be sent to a convent. Even if she couldn\u2019t raise the point in court, she easily could have asked Gwyn or Gwalchmai to convey the message to Arthur. And did no one think it was a bad idea to send Gwynhwyfar back to Camlann under the control of the man who brought about her ruin?Luckily, Gwynhwyfar and Bedwyr don\u2019t have a monopoly on stupid decisions\u2014Gwalchmai makes the uncharacteristic demand for war with Less Britain after his son\u2019s death. To be fair, Gwalchmai\u2019s need for vengeance is entirely understandable. But for him to refuse personal vengeance in favor of a war that can only benefit the person who was (arguably) responsible for Gwyn\u2019s death? Told from Gwalchmai\u2019s point of view, this decision may have been a compelling inner conflict of the Light and Darkness that still plague him\u2014the emotional climax of the series. Told secondhand, it\u2019s drained of any emotion and reads like a foregone conclusion.As a result, when Gwynhwyfar gives her monologue at the end\u2014\u201cNot only is it all lost, it was we who lost it, we who by our own stupidity and weakness allowed ourselves to be divided\u201d\u2014it does not come off as profound. It has readers nodding their heads because it highlights the major flaw of the novel.If you\u2019ve never read an Arthurian story, you might enjoy this one. Bradshaw has an excellent grasp of history, and her writing style, especially the dialogue, mimics the language of the time period while still feeling modern. If only she had used this mastery to finish Gwalchmai\u2019s story rather than diverting to the tired royal affair. In Winter\u2019s Shadow is a shadow of what it could have been.",
            "Depressing af of course, but a well-told tragedy. The choice of Gwenhwyfar as narrator is well made. The tragedy spares no character. But it is one-note. The small flirtation at the end--was the glory of Rome something that deserved to be resurrected?--would have been vastly more interesting to explore. Still this is compelling reading, hard-to-put down and pretty a pretty sad end to characters we've come to love.",
            "First published in 1982 and now reissued by Sourcebooks Landmark, Gillian Bradshaw\u2019s In Winter's Shadow is the concluding volume of the Down the Long Wind trilogy. An Arthurian tale, this series focuses greatly on those surrounding the legendary High King and Emperor. In Book 1, Hawk of May, the story\u2019s emphasis is on Arthur\u2019s emissary Gwalchmai and his ascendancy from childhood to royal servitude and respected combatant. Book 2, Kingdom of Summer still has Gwalchmai as the main character, but it\u2019s told from the perspective of his manservant, Rhys. Summer chronicles the rising tide that began to swell against Arthur, as well as the personal relationships of Gwalchmai, Rhys, and their love interests.Book 3, In Winter\u2019s Shadow varies in that it\u2019s told from the perspective of a woman, Emperor Arthur\u2019s wife Gwynhwyfar. Through Queen Gwynhwyfar\u2019s eyes, we watch the continued struggle of Arthur and his Family against the forces of evil, brought on predominantly by his bastard son, Medraut. The Queen is very much a part of this struggle herself, as she is not only a leader within her community but is incredibly affected by events without and within. While her loyalty ultimately is always with Arthur, her heart is frequently torn between what is right and what is desired. This leads to trouble both within her marriage and throughout the entire kingdom. The longest of the three volumes, In Winter\u2019s Shadow took the shortest amount of time for me to read. I found every chapter to be quite interesting, and not bogged down in unnecessary set dressing and descriptive language. Bradshaw\u2019s writing is such that we are easily transported to this Arthurian world, but without excessive baggage. There are battles without ridiculous amounts of gory details, passionate anger without cheap vulgarities and adulterous love scenes with just enough information to get the point across. It\u2019s decidedly less spiritual than the first two thirds of the trilogy, and I missed having more of that element within the plot, but the political intrigue and relational dramas more than made up for that change in composition.Down the Long Wind is different from other Arthurian tales in that there is no \u201cRound Table\u201d per se and no mystical Merlin character (although there is a briefly mentioned, mysterious bard named Taliesin). The fortress of Camelot is the more traditionally named Camlann. However, much of the original legend is retained, with a moderate amount of magic and spirituality within the first two thirds of the trilogy. This last portion, In Winter\u2019s Shadow follows the travails and struggles of Arthur, his Queen and the forces swirling around them. There is adventure, betrayal, loyalty, passion, victory and defeat. It\u2019s a sweeping tale that spans decades and easily transports the reader to another time and place. I can say that I wish the final chapters had turned out somewhat differently than they did. Without offering any revealing details, the conclusion is not tied up perfectly in a tidy bow, with all parties happy and gratified. That being said, I felt that matters were handled in a highly realistic and possibly more historic fashion, if there is any truth to the Arthurian legends. In Winter\u2019s Shadow is a fine conclusion to a very satisfying trilogy. I enjoyed hearing the story from the perspective of a woman, and Bradshaw always made her narrative interesting and worth my time. I frequently read this volume during my morning and afternoon walks by a lake, on the way to or from dropping my sons off from school. I always looked forward to that time, as it was a delightful escape from the duties and responsibilities of my day. I certainly recommend Down the Long Wind, especially if you\u2019re a fan of Arthurian novels, but also if you enjoy a captivating, sweeping tale of adventure, magic, love and political intrigue. Gillian Bradshaw produced a fine work 30 years ago, and it is certainly worth its current re-emergence in the marketplace today. Hopefully it will acquire a new audience and continue to be enjoyed for years to come.",
            "AudioBook ReviewStars: Overall: 4 Narration: 5 Story: 4 Carrying the story forward, the story is now told by Gwenhwyfar or Guinevere as more commonly known. Bradshaw has managed to bring us to the end of days for Camelot, with the final battles, the death of Mordred, Gwalchmai\u2019s death and her own roles and guilt for her part. Again managing to re-invent the story of King Arthur using Bretonized forms of the names and presenting unique perspectives on the events, with points of view that were left untold or unimagined in the originals, Bradshaw has managed to neatly pull all of the threads together and wrap this series with a conclusion that is both refreshing and satisfying. What stands out prominently for me is Bradshaw\u2019s ability to present her characters in a way that both feels unique yet holds true to their own internal dialogue as they explain, tell and share their parts of the story. From Gwalchmai\u2019s guilt about his lost love, to the very well-reasoned and completely real sense of \u2018what is right\u2019 that Gwenhwyfar presents as she wraps up the series, this reads as if the characters are real and palpable, giving readers the ability to commiserate, empathize, learn from and enjoy each person as they appear. Narration is again provided by Nicole Quinn who manages to present the arcane and archaic place and character names with a smoothness that never falters. That is a quality of major importance, as the names and places are often tongue twisters, and the flow of the story would be greatly impacted if the pronunciation faltered or varies. Additionally, her narration of the many moods of Gwenhwyfar, and the addition of simple adjustments in accent, tone and pace as she presented the other characters not only were easy to distinguish, but added to the enjoyment and impact of the story. Touches of Wales and Scotland, as well as a bit of the \u2018Northern\u2019 accent all add to the story, and her seamless transitions in this well-produced performance are a wonderful addition. I received an AudioBook copy of the title via AudioBook Jukebox for purpose of honest review. I was not compensated for this review: all conclusions are my own responsibility. ",
            "The thing about Arthurian legend books it that for them to be written well they are often bitterly and heartrendingly tragic. This one was no exception. A powerful story told through the eyes of the heart of the storm itself, it will pull at your heart. I'm not sure why I continue to read the Arthurian legend books, knowing already how they'll end, but In Winter's Shadow is an excellent conclusion to Ms. Bradshaw's series. The characters were well fleshed out with only rare instances of feeling a bit flat. There were times where I felt that some scenes were disconcertingly abrupt and could have benefited from a bit more exposition to keep them from feeling somewhat deus ex machina, but on a whole I devoured this book. It definitely left me with that bittersweet sadness at the inevitable conclusion."

            "2020 bk 162. This book tried to do too many things - and almost pulled it off. it begins with the relationship between Jefferson and the Hemings family, moves to his years in France where he pays to have James taught the art of French cuisine and running a large kitchen. There were items I had not known, as in I hadn't realized that Jefferson was there for Bastille Day. We learned a little, just a little of what it was like for James Hemings. We then move back to the U. S., where James has to extract a promise from Jefferson to honor his pledge of being freed - which doesn't occur James Hemings is 30 years of age. From there, the book is more focused on Jefferson and politics, with a few mentions of those Hemings trained in his methods to follow him. I wish there had been more on the cooking and the menus. With Jefferson's record keeping, I'm sure there was more. There were a few recipes, not many. There is a good amount (but not as complete as other accounts) of the foods the pair introduced to America, along with the plants. This is a good introduction - but I was looking for more."

            "This combines two of my favorite topics- American history and food. In 1784 Thomas Jefferson makes a deal with his slave, James Hemings. James will travel with him to France and be trained in the fine art of French cooking, and will then bring this knowledge back home to train the slaves at Monticello. After this service is completed, James is to be granted his freedom. Much of the story involves the events that are going on in France at the time, the revolution against the monarchy of Louis XVI and Marie Antoinette. I found it fascinating to see what people were eating in those days both in France and America, necessity and availabilty played a factor in the daily diet. Jefferson was always on the lookout to bring new ideas back home to his beloved country to make it the best place it could possibly be. He kept amazingly detailed records of every little plan and item puchased in regards to his estate and the care of his slaves, and was always experimenting with new ways to improve life for himself and those around him. The history of food is a fascinating story all in itself. So much of what is now Southern and American food is a fusion of so many different cultures, not just of French influence. Many of the foods and dishes were African in origin, what the slaves were used to in their native homes- Ngombo (gumbo), okra, black-eyed peas, hoppin' john, and so many more. Some of the French ideas brought back were macaroni and cheese, creme brulee, French fries, Champagne, and sauces. My biggest disappointment in this story is the lack of information about James Hemings. I would have loved to have had some perspective from his point of view, what his life was like both in France and then when he returned to America, and then when he finally became a free man. It is so sad that his experiences and feelings are lost to us. ",
            "This book is a delightful look at Thomas Jefferson and his love of food. The author\u2019s writing style makes it a quick and easy read. Readers looking for a more \u201cserious\u201d historical record should look elsewhere -he gives a thumbnail sketch of the man, his life in politics, and acknowledges the controversy surrounding his personal life but concentrates on food. The pictures of actual recipes in Jefferson\u2019s and Hemings\u2019 handwriting were wonderful, I just wish there had been more transcribed so that I could read them. I found the information about the eating habits of Colonial Americans and French peasants and aristocrats to be extremely interesting. Often when reading history books, I find it hard to picture the actual people who lived at that time. In my opinion, many historians get so bogged down in facts they forget these were living, breathing, feeling people\u2026 what did they wear, how did they entertain themselves, what did they eat? ",
            "Betcha didn't know that Thomas Jefferson and his slave James Hemings were responsible for bringing champagne, French fries, and yes, creme brulee to the American palate. This was a fun adventure by the publisher who brought you MISS PEREGRINE'S HOME FOR PECULIAR CHILDEREN. ",
            "Thomas J. Craughwell. Thomas Jefferson\u2019s Creme Br\u00fbl\u00e9e Philadelphia: Quirk Books, 2012.One of the ongoing requirements when one claims to be a culinary historian is the infamoussurvey of the field\u201d. Thus I found myself excited one evening at the local bookstore when I stumbled upon Mr. Craughwell\u2019s \u201cJefferson\u2019s Cr\u00e8me Br\u00fbl\u00e9e\u201d. Not only am I a lifelong admirer of Thomas Jefferson and have read much about his life and career but I am also in the midst of composing a culinary history. Needless to say, I scooped up the book and walked out of the bookstore beaming and thrilled to have a point of reference for my work. At first though, I was a bit upset as I began to read. A culinary history ? I asked myself. There's hardly anything in here about food or cooking, although the theme of the book is Jefferson's trip to France, his investigation into the cuisine of France and the relationship he had with his slave and cook James Hemings. However as the book progressed it reads like an overall survey of Jefferson's diplomatic trip to France. Now I had already read about all this in numerous works on Jefferson and so was familiar with the basic outline of the time he spent in Europe. Where were the recipes? Where was the chronicle of James Hemings\u2019 training as a cook in Paris? Where was the analysis of Thomas Jefferson's common books regarding which foods he wanted to bring back to America? Mr. Craughwell\u2019s book contained a lot of - well, he probably did this, they probably ate that, they may have used this recipe, he may have had these people over for dinner, he may have bragged about James\u2019 skill in the kitchen, but none of this wasmore than speculation nor verified by any sources. There was little discussion, if any, as to what foods they actually ate and how those foods were actually cooked. Needless to say, I was a bit put off by all of this but then I realized when comparing it to my own work that what my sources produce compared to what Mr. Craughwell sources are, there is not that much actual discussion of food in the records. I was guilty of the same thing Mr. Craughwell presented. My book is based upon probability. However, I like to think that my researches into actual foods present in French colonial Louisiana and actual spices present, as well as what the French normally used in the 18th century kitchen. Also, discussions of smuggling and of markets and of the creation of New Orleans and it\u2019s Creole culture are all based on valid historical sources both primary and secondary. Not to say that Mr. Craughwell did not do his homework but it does not come across as such. So lesson learned - I need to make sure I come across as such. Anyway back to Mr. Craughwell\u2019s book. The main body of the book, the text itself, is a fine account of Jefferson's trip to France. It includes a limited discussion of James\u2019 career in Paris as an apprentice chef. But it is not very detailed. All in all, the text, beyond the trip to France, is a bunch of \u201cprobably\u201d. The culinary matter of the work is relegated to a 30 page appendix where Jefferson\u2019s vegetable garden, his wine cellar, and some of his recipes are presented. The recipes are only slightly useful as they are screenshots of Jefferson\u2019s actual common books as well as other works and recipes from the time. Unfortunately, they are all hand written and being scans or screenshots of such documents, can be difficult to read CONCLUSION: if you would like a thorough account of Jefferson's trip to France with a nod toward the foodstuffs and culinary ideas he acquired while there, this is a good read. As a culinary history it falls a little bit short. Even though it does make up for it somewhat in the Appendix. There is no category listed on the dust jacket as on some books but on the cover it says \u201cHow a founding father and his slave James Hemings introduced French cuisine to America\u201d and that subtitle does come up somewhat short. It's easy to read but not very informative to anyone who has studied Thomas Jefferson to any extent and certainly not very informative as to the cuisine that it claims to cover."

Soon thereafter he met Ernest Fenollosa who become the preeminent voice in defending Japan's traditional art forms against the drive to modernization and westernization of the early Meiji Restoration. Under his influence Okakura worked toward reeducating the Japanese people to appreciate their own cultural heritage. He was one of the principal founders of the Tokyo Fine Arts School, opened in 1887. In 1898 Okakura was ousted from the school in an administrative struggle. He next established the Nippon Bijutsu-in (Japan Academy of Fine Arts) with the help of such followers as Hishida Shunso and Yokoyama Taikan. A frequent traveler abroad, at the turn of the century Okakura became curator of the Oriental art division of the Boston Museum of Fine Arts. Many of his works, such as The Ideals of the East (1903), The Awakening of Japan (1904), and The Book of Tea (1906), were written in English in order to spread abroad his ideas.",

With a photographic memory, he could envision entire technical schematics within his own mind and all he needed was time to make them work. It is a shame he never got that opportunity to fully develop his 'flying machine' or 'World -system'. The internet as we know it today pales in comparison to what he truly envisioned. ",
            "Who was Nikola Tesla? You owe him every time you turn on a light or use an electric appliance. You owe him every time you turn on a radio or use a computer. Yet he has been swept into obscurity with others given credit for his work.This book is filled with photographs of Tesla and his work. He truly was a master of lightning having discovered how to generate it himself. He found how to transmit electric power without wires. He developed the alternating current (AC) for practical use, the motors to use it and transmit it. George Westinghouse used his patents to spread it over the country yet never paid royalties to Tesla leaving him close to penniless.Tesla developed the basic devices needed for radio. Marconi used his patents, took credit for developing radio himself. The Supreme court finally upheld Tesla's claims, after his death and even the Smithsonian has ignored the finding.Tesla was an eccentric. He never married.This book is a bit scholarly with lots of sidebars about Tesla's various patents and work. The main text is mostly easy to follow. It highlights an eccentric genius and his work who should get much more credit and recognition than he does.",

The narrative is well composed chronologically, and rife with patent illustrations. I knew much already about Tesla, and this taught me more. Fascinating man, with a fascinating legacy.

There are a lot of photographs and diagrams, but they truly enhance the experience. Think Davinci and the need for pictoral reference of his works.Nikola Tesla was one of our largest scientific contributors in the past 150 years, and hardly anyone in America knows ANYTHING about him!!! Tesla was surging ahead with AC electrical implementations while Edison's web of DC lines were littering New York City. Unfortunately, Tesla was NOT business savvy in any way and it was ultimately his downfall. Westinghouse bought the intellectual property for AC from Tesla and the rest is history. His contributions to radio and long distance communications cannot be denied. This book gives an exciting portrayal of the life, eccentricity, and genius that was Tesla, sure to fascinate almost any guest you may have.",
            "Genius is one of those words that gets thrown around a lot, and most of the time we\u2019re just talking about someone who is a tick or two smarter than the rest of us. But Tesla was the real deal. And reading this book helps you really understand how much of a genius he was. From the very beginning, he had a grasp on the nature of electricity that no one else alive had, or perhaps even anyone today. And because he could understand its nature, he could apply it in ways that people like Edison and Marconi and Roentgen (the inventor of the x-ray) could only guess at. He took the first step that led to inventions like the wireless telegraph, the x ray, remote control, and was solely responsible for alternating current and the AC motor, which revolutionized industry.Perhaps his invention that still hasn\u2019t been completely understood is the Tesla coil. He understood its implications so completely that he was planning on using it for a jumping-off point for wireless energy, worldwide communication (and even communication to other planets), and had plans for a death ray that would shoot down hundreds of planes from 250 miles away.It sounds like science fiction, and his thinking was so far ahead of much of the world that he could often make claims that people would believe, even if he meant them in jest. But despite his countless inventions and patents, he was not a businessman, and he ended up dying penniless. This is an interesting story about a fascinating man. What I find incredible is that how far ahead of his time he was, many of his concepts are being researched and pursued today.",
            "Tesla, Master of Lighting was an incredible book that was filled with information that increased my knowledge of him as an inventor and as a person. The book was a complete biography of important inventions, events, problems, etc. This book includes everything one would need to know about Tesla and his life. The book was conveniently organized into sections that informed the reader of important parts of his life. This would be useful if someone would like to know about a certain aspect/invention of Nikola Tesla. Even though this book was a biography, it managed to keep me entertained through the entire book. The book also provided me with a lot of pictures for me to look at, which further increased my knowledge of his inventions and what they looked like. Being a electronics and circuitry enthusiast myself, the illustrations not only increased my knowledge of electronics, but also fascinated me in their complexity. This book is wonderful for those who like to learn about electronics and the modern day effect on what was done in the late 19th century to early 20th. I would recommend this book to everyone though, it is important to learn about people and events that changed our nation forever.",
            "This book should be required reading in schools. Authors Margaret Cheney and Robert Uth created a masterpiece on the life of Nikola Tesla, in my opinion the greatest mind the world has ever known. From his youth in (what is now) Croatia until his final days in New York City, all of the important events, discoveries, letters, inventions and diagrams are included. The fantastic photographs alone are worth getting this book, they are plentiful throughout adding a tangible nature to things that happened so long ago and are so difficult for the average person to comprehend, like wireless transmission of energy.I cannot fathom how Tesla\u2019s mind worked and probably never will, but my appreciation for Tesla and what he did for modern humanity is unsurpassed. I find him the most fascinating human who ever existed (aside perhaps only Jesus Christ). And the part that hurts the most is that Tesla did so much for us yet was constantly held back because he was way too far ahead of his time. He was purposeful hindered and disregarded by those in power who either didn\u2019t want to see him succeed (Edison) or didn\u2019t see the profit in what he was proposing (Morgan et al).If those in power had only listened to Tesla and followed him, the world would be even more amazing than it has become because of his inventions. We could have had free, sustainable, environmentally-friendly energy worldwide. We could have had electric cars for over 100 years. We could have had a planet without war. We could have had so much that we can barely imagine. Unfortunately the world was not ready for Tesla in 1900, and sadly it is still not ready for his ideas.I pray that Tesla\u2019s own prophecy comes to fruition: that the future will be his. To say he was unappreciated during his time is gross understatement. I pray humankind of the future will learn to implement his ideas, though I\u2019m not sure our brightest minds working together today could even understand what Tesla knew well over 100 years ago.Tesla\u2019s was the most amazing lifetime I have ever heard of. I\u2019m so grateful to the authors for putting this wonderful book together. I want everyone to read it and know better the mind and astounding achievements of Nikola Tesla, the world\u2019s premier genius.",

But the evidence indicates that long before the first official landings by Spanish conquistadores, the Floridian civilization was already moribund, at least partly due to diseases brought to the area by marooned sailors. refugees from the Caribbean, etc.As for 'Seminoles' doing anything, the evidence indicates that there was no such 'tribe' until well after the Spaniards arrived. The Seminole were a coalition of exiles, escaped slaves, etc. Their language was based on a Creek dialect, and they didn't form a coherent tribe until quite late. By that time, the south Floridian civilization was probably already quite defunct. Norton's fear of reptiles is so pronounced in this book that she suggests that sea turtles might attack people.

            "Pyramid is not hugely original as a fantasy novel - there are princesses, demons, and spies, all things that most fantasy readers are pretty familiar with by now - except for the fact that the story features two women who love each other romantically.I have one word for this:AWESOME.Good LORD, it is RIDICULOUSLY DIFFICULT to find fantasy with LGBT characters! By which I don't mean lgbt-fantasy, like Without Reservations and its ilk, I mean well-written, well-thought-out fantasy novels that just HAPPEN to have girls who love girls, or boys who love boys, or people who love both/neither, or people born into the wrong gender - whichever! One or all of the above! I love books where these things are worked naturally into the plot, where the story is not All About Teh Gay but doesn't exclude Teh Gay, either.And Pyramid is wonderful. So what if it's not super original? It is EXTREMELY well-written and readable - I read the entire book in a single day, and would have done it in a single sitting if people hadn't kept interrupting! The worldbuilding is excellent: both societies featured in the book (the Farradains and the Allusians) have a history, religion, and general culture of their own, all of which is integrated smoothly into the story without the requirements of the dreaded info-dump. One of my favourite things about this book were the Allusian idioms, and Starbride's difficulty with the Farradain ones (which are common idioms that will probably be familiar to the reader, like 'now her goose is cooked', etc). The characters, too, are fantastic, very well developed and three-dimensional. Katya and Starbride, the two main characters (who take turns to narrate the story, via third-person alternate chapters) are both strong and intelligent, but still very different. I loved their romance (and the fact that this was not an Issues story - same-gender romances don't bat an eye in Pyramid's world), especially the realism of it, there were difficulties and compromises, just as there are in a real relationship but which so many authors idealise away. I also REALLY loved pretty much every one of the minor characters: the whole cast is beautifully fleshed-out, with their own stories, histories, and mysteries, not all of which are told, explained or answered by the end of this book (which, again, is fantastic - yay for not spoon-feeding your readers!)The story itself is, on the surface, relatively simple: there are traitors plotting Bad Things, and since the crown prince will be arriving in two weeks Katya (who also happens to be second in line to the throne) is charged with making sure their plots don't come to fruition. Starbride, meanwhile, arrives at the Farrandain palace in order to learn as much Farrandain law as possible, so she can help her people back home (who are being cheated by Farrandain merchants and lawyers). But things are much more complicated than that: not just because there are hidden mysteries, but because Wright doesn't gloss over the politics of living at court or the difficulty of hunting down spies. Nor does she ever forget that a monarch is ultimately answerable to their people, something which curbs the actions of several characters over the course of the story. What I mean is: even though Katya is a princess, and most of the characters are various kinds of Noble and/or Important, they can't do anything they want. Very few fantasy books remember that there are legal limitations on these kinds of characters, but Wright never forgets any of it. What I'm trying to say is that, although another author's attempt at Pyramid Waltz would have resulted in a very bland, boring story of the kind we've all read a million times, Wright actually looks at things, and considers them realistically. With the result that what should have been just another fantasy knock-off is wonderful, hilarious, emotional, well-thought-out and just generally fantastic. Even without having a lesbian couple, Pyramid would have been an excellent book, but with them Pyramid is going straight to my favourites list. I suggest you go out and buy a copy right now.",
            "I really loved itI'm not what you would consider an avid lesfic fantasy reader. I usually go for the straight romance types but I wanted to give this a read and I'm really glad I did. It had everything, beautiful men and women, sword fights, demons, light romance, and a bit more. The fight scenes were well described and even though the book was slow at times, it did keep me captivated. I know the series is finished and I can't wait to read the next one.",
            "It didn't end exactly the way I'd want it to, and the first couple paragraphs, while solid, didn't really pull me in. Otherwise, probably one of the best books I've read. Good solid action, solid world building, and one of the best displays of two strong independent people coming together in love and as equal partners. Neither submissive, neither dominant. Maybe something of that will/or did turn up in a later book, though I like the way it is at the moment. Those looking for graphic descriptions of sex will be disappointed. This one had more of the 1950s movie feel for those intimate scenes. Which I actually liked.",
            "This is the story of two charming young women with vastly different backgrounds and personalities falling in love while their whole world tries to crash down around them. The excitement of discovery and anticipation both within their relationship and the action-driven main plot give the whole story a sense of urgency and danger that will keep you from putting the book down.The love scenes are tantalizing, yet tastefully written. This is lesbian romance your straight parents can read... if they're a bit liberal. The characters flirt and tease each other - and the reader - but the resolution is so sweet it will warm your heart (and perhaps some other bits as well).But, this is so much more than a romance novel, this book kicks right off with an exciting fight scene written so masterfully that you will raise a sweat. And the hits just keep on coming throughout the book. This book is equal parts romance and epic fantasy action set in an immersive fantasy world. The magic is uniquely fresh while being consistent and believable. To top it off, the whole book is laced with a subtle brand of witty comedy that will raise a chuckle on every page. The book is by no means a comedy, but the comedic elements really bring the characters out and makes them real people. It keeps the serious, and sometimes dark, themes of the story feeling light as the characters deal with it like we all would.This is a book you'll read again to go back to hang out with your old friends Katya, Starbride and the whole Order of Vestra. You will want to go back and read again as their love grows, knowing what is coming. I hope we see more books about Katya, Starbride and this new fantasy world.",
            "Action and intrigue worthy of any fantasy collection.This was a really good book. Barbara Ann Wright created an interesting fantasy world with a magic that is uniquely her own. The Pyramid Waltz was about a royal family that carries more than just a claim to the throne within their blood. I liked that the love interest for Princess Katya, Starbride, was more than just your typical damsel in distress. Overall the book was entertaining and kept me engaged enough to pull me through at a decent pace. I will say that I wasn't a huge fan of the ending. Mostly out of personal preference but I also thought that it could have been just a little longer. It was somewhat happy for the two main characters but the book didn't really end so much as prepare you for a sequel. Clearly I've come about this series a bit late since it's been out a few years now. So it would be no real hardship to move on to the next but I sense that it's one of those series where your truly happy ending and story resolution is stolen again and again which is a story that I really have to be in the mood for.I think it would be perfect for anyone looking for more intrigue and action than romance. Those were two things Wright did very well with The Pyramid Waltz. A great addition to any fantasy collection. ",
            "This was a great read, not normally my cup of tea but the author did a super job pulling me into the political intrigue of the secret order protecting the secrets of the Crown, and especially the relationship between the leading characters. The way she wove the buildup of their love and the sexual tension was masterful.Chapters alternated between their viewpoints which gave a heightened visibility into how each of them interpreted the others words and actions, as well as improving the tension.The setting was rich, original and superbly described. The author excelled at showing the difference between Starbride's people and Katya's Kingdom.The plot unraveled slowly but steadily and I never felt lost, although the foreshadowing fell flat in a couple of places. The final conflict was unexpected and a little muddled in places, especially as the author did such a great job previously in the book. Neither of these points stopped this being a great book.",
            "This is a fantastic book. From the first page, the reader is thrown into a fast-paced melange of romance, combat, magic and intrigue that does not break pace.It's very accessible, in that the reader is provided with enough information to understand what's going on, but not so much that every detail is spelled out in agonizing detail (if you've ever read Stephen King, you'll know what I mean). It's witty and engaging, and the characters are dynamic and rough around the edges.This book has something for everybody. I would not hesitate in recommending it for any book group, as it is sure to spark some lively debates.",
            "The Princess and the PyramidI love Fantasy. I love Fantasy's ability to take us to another world, to explore familiar themes in an unfamiliar setting which would be too cumbersome or incredible to deal with in a realistic setting. And though you'll never get me to admit it in a court of law, I'm pretty much a hopeless romantic, and though Romance is not normally my genre, give me a good love story inside a Speculative Fiction trapping, and I'm set.One of the big problems with Fantasy, though, is the level of bland whitewashing in the most popular series. While diversity can be found if you dig deep enough, the stories of the Jordans, the Goodkinds, the Rothfusses and what-have-you are, at their heart, stories about straight white dudes often saving the world from other straight white dudes (or even worse, villainous brown gay people).With that in mind, Barbara Ann Wright's The Pyramid Waltz is pretty much a revelation. The two central characters, Princess Katya and Starbride, inhabit a world where same-sex love is as uncontroversial as opposite marriage, which itself is fantastic (there's a place for exploring homosexuality in an oppressive society, but sometimes it's nice to see a pair of lesbians who aren't inherently star-crossed!). Which isn't to say their relationship is all smooth sailing. Starbride, a visitor from a land some might call exotic (though don't say it to her face), has to balance her very real attraction with the expectation that she use Katya's influence to help her family. Katya, on the other hand, is the guardian of a very dark, very threatening family secret, and while she can't bear to lie to her new lover, becoming close might very well mean bringing Starbride into danger.Wright's writing possesses a sharp wit, an amazing eye for detail (her fashion description is breathtaking at times) and a keen sense of the flow of battle -- and oh, for all the focus on feelings, there is plenty of battle.If I had to make one criticism, it's that the pacing is pretty speedy near the end. The otherworldly, realm-threatening conflict that's only been hinted at in most of the book gets thrown into the open and (temporarily, I hope!) dealt with in the space of thirty pages or so. I would have liked to see stretched out a bit, but then, it's hard for me to be too critical about this, as watching Katya unravel the mystery years in the making is immensely entertaining, and the book's cliffhanger makes it clear that there's plenty more fiendish conflict to come.I should also at least mention The Pyramid Waltz's magic system. I'm not normally one to gush over innovative (i.e., complicated) magic systems in Fantasy novels, for instance, I found Sanderson's oft-praised metallurgy system in Mistborn better suited to a role-playing game than a story. But I did very much enjoy Waltz's creation of a relic-based paradigm. Magic is performed using pyramids, hand-held objects created by master craftsmen known as pyradist\u00e9s. I thought the subtle comparison, intentional or not, between artisan jewelers and the magicians added a lot of depth to the system, instead of making it feel tacked on.I had a great time reading The Pyramid Waltz, and I would absolutely recommend it to any fan of Fantasy or Romance who isn't afraid of shrivelling up from cooties because our lead isn't a shaggy-haired, muscly boy destined to become a Chosen One. I, for one, think a pair of women finding love in spite of the dark events enveloping them is far more interesting. "

But what, exactly, is secularism? What has the West\u2019s long familiarity with it inevitably obscured? In Questioning Secularism, Hussein Ali Agrama tackles these questions. Focusing on the fatwa councils and family law courts of Egypt just prior to the revolution, he delves deeply into the meaning of secularism itself and the ambiguities that lie at its heart. Drawing on a precedent-setting case arising from the family law courts \u2014the last courts in Egypt to use Shari\u2018a law\u2014Agrama shows that secularism is a historical phenomenon that works through a series of paradoxes that it creates. Digging beneath the perceived differences between the West and Middle East, he highlights secularism\u2019s dependence on the law and the problems that arise from it: the necessary involvement of state sovereign power in managing the private spiritual lives of citizens and the irreducible set of legal ambiguities such a relationship creates. Navigating a complex landscape between private and public domains, Questioning Secularism lays important groundwork for understanding the real meaning of secularism as it affects the real freedoms of a citizenry, an understanding of the utmost importance for so many countries that are now urgently facing new political possibilities.",

            "Agrama\u2019s book is highly readable thanks to his clear and structured style of writing despite the complex arguments he tackles. I would recommend this book to anyone interested in learning more on the tensions surrounding Islam and secularism or those who are interested in debates on the doctrines of secularism.Agrama\u2019s innovative contribution to the study of secularism is his comparison of the personal status courts and the Fatwa Council. Agrama\u2019s comparative analysis is able to close the gap between macro-level theoretical underpinnings of secularism and everyday practice involving the authority in law. For example, Agrama distinguishes between the asecular nature of the Fatwa Council and the secular nature of the personal status courts, although the two institutions share the following similarities: they are under the state, they are products of modern reforms, and they draw their understanding from the Shari\u2019a. Agrama\u2019s earlier piece titled Ethics, tradition, authority: Toward an anthropology of the fatwa provides a more engaging account of his experiences at the Fatwa Council. However, Questioning Secularism supplants ethnographic accounts with an explanation as to why fatwas, despite their non-binding nature, exercise greater authority over court rulings: \u201cThe attention the muftis pay to the people\u2019s particular situations, and the careful allocation of responsibility in the council, serves to create strong bond between the muftis and the questioners \u2026 creating a measure of trust that secures the fatwa\u2019s authority\u201d (Agrama 184). Despite its striking originality, the book is marred somewhat by Agrama\u2019s analysis that is confined to a liberal framework.The reason why Agrama\u2019s analysis is confined in this way is that Agrama does not avail himself of the opportunity to use the asecular nature of the Fatwa Council or the protest movement to challenge or speak back against secular governance in Egypt. Simply put, Agrama\u2019s analysis does not challenge secular power. Instead, Agrama only renders the aspects of secular power visible. This is due to Agrama\u2019s limited analysis of the relationship between secularism and asecularism encapsulated in the following metaphor: \u201cBut like a bubble within a bubble, produced by it but no longer of it, bouncing around within its confines yet otherwise largely indifferent to it, the Fatwa Council is a space produced by secular power but one that nevertheless remains largely disengaged from it\u201d (187). There are other anthropologists (e.g. Saba Mahmood and Lila Abu-Lughod) who have used their research to speak against liberalism and therefore challenge different conventionalized aspects characteristic of liberalism. Agrama can challenge the power of secularism through investigating the nature of the relationship between asecularism and secularism. To reiterate, Agrama states that \u201cthe Fatwa Council is a space produced by secular power but one that nevertheless remains largely disengaged from it\u201d (187). How do the asecular and secular interact? What happens, at seemingly limited times, when the asecular and secular engage? What are the practical implications, both on the state level and everyday life, of interactions between the asecular and secular? How will the interaction between the two domains affect secular power? Can the asecular be used to resist the power of the secular? If so, how? These are just some examples of the questions I raise in demonstrating how Agrama might approach the relationship between the asecular and secular. By investigating the relationship between the two, I am hoping that one would be able to challenge the current manifestation of secular power in Egypt by offering an alternative form of secular power that extends beyond the conventions of a liberal framework.",

Each page rhymes and repeats an easy word three times while teaching kids to count in ones and later tens.Professional Recommendation/Review #1:\u00b7 Kirkus (Kirkus Reviews)After an alphabetical, rhyming tour de force (LMNO Peas , 2010), Baker's energetic pea pack is back--this time, to count by ones and 10s. Baker sidesteps the trickiness of rhyming the numerals by selecting a repeating word for each short verse. ONE pea searching--look, look, look, / TWO peas fishing--hook, hook, hook.  Those numerals rise sky-high (to peas, at least) to dominate the digitally composed visuals, often serving as props for the frenzy of vegetative activity. At TEN peas building--pound, pound, pound , the peas erect a wooden platform around the numeral--mainly, it would seem, as an excuse for exuberantly hammering dozens of nails. Baker circumvents those oft-pesky 'teens in one deft double-page spread: Eleven to nineteen--skip, skip, skip!  Then it's a double-page spread per decade, with peas traveling, napping, watching fireworks and more. SEVENTY peas singing provide a bevy of details to spy: A fab foursome (the Peatles) rocks out above a chorus and director. Nearby, a barbershop quartet, a Wagnerian soloist, a showering pea and a dancing Peayonc\u00e9 add to the fun. Whether they're counting scores of peas, enjoying the rhymes and puns or relishing the funny visual quirks, families are sure to devour Baker's latest winner. Totally ap-pea-ling!http://www.clcd.com.ezaccess.librarie...Professional Recommendation/Review #2 : Publishers Weekly (Publishers Weekly) The bipedal green peas that starred in LMNO Peas return in a lively counting romp. Interacting with large, brightly colored numerals, the peas plant seeds, hammer nails into a wooden platform, and jump into a pool: Five peas painting / brush, brush, brush,/ Six peas traveling / rush, rush, rush. The peas skip rope as numbers 11 through 19 are clustered onto one spread ( skip, skip, skip ), before the book begins counting by tens and the commotion rockets, bringing readers up to 100. Baker's energizing graphics are as joyful and fresh as in the first book, anthropomorphizing the peas in spreads that burst with personality. \u00b7http://www.clcd.com.ezaccess.librarie...Response to Two Professional Reviews:They definitely both agree on the joyful peas. Both reviews are extremely similar and refer to the size of the numbers and the actions performed by the peas (such as hammering). Both also agree on the rhythm, rhyming, and bright colored pages. Evaluation of Literary Elements: This book does an excellent job at using alliteration and repetition to create rhythm and give the peas action. The images are strategic in the way that the numbers are huge, colorful, bright, and take up most of the page. The plot is quite simple, following peas as they take part in daily activities. Consideration of Instructional Application: Each page has the number of peas on them so since it begins with the ones you can have the students count aloud with you. You can also bring maybe green marbles and have them pretend they are the peas and have them count along. ",
            "This book was a colorful book that helps students with counting and rhyming words. The illustrations help show kids how much a certain number looks like by having the amount of peas on a page with a corresponding number. I plan to teach Special Education, where many students have a hard time understanding that numbers are a specific amount, but this book can help them visual the numbers. The pages were full of color and movement, which will help keep little kids' attention. On every page, the peas are doing something different. There is a controlled word choice, so beginning readers may enjoy reading this book with fun sounding rhyming words that are still simple. This is one of the more fun concept books that I have seen because of all the fun and colorful illustrations. I think younger elementary students would enjoy this book greatly. I plan on purchasing this book for my future classroom because of its usefulness. This book may even boost a student\u2019s interest into math because it puts a fun twist on numbers. ",

            "This counting book by Keith Baker is a great book to help kids ages 3-5 learn how to count. Each page begins counting numbers, adding one each time. For example, the first page is 1,2 and the second is 3. Children will really enjoy this book because the illustrations are cute and fun. On each page there are the amount of little peas counted on the doing the actions described. This book is also great for teaching counting because the numbers are illustrated really big. This makes the children pay attention to them, and helps them recognize them better. The pages are also really bright and colorful. This can also help catch children's attention. This is a great book to read to children to help make learning to count more enjoyable. "

            "Elie Wiesel, a world famous, highly honored (and sometimes-criticized) Jewish writer and political activist, was born in Romania in 1928. The novella Dawn was his first work of fiction, published in 1960. Together with his famous memoir Night (1958, of the time he spent in Auschwitz and Buchenwald concentration camps in 1944-5) and his next fictional work, Day (1961) it appears in The Night Trilogy. Wiesel died in 2016.The Night Trilogy edition of Dawn (which I read) has a preface, dating to 2006, in which Wiesel writes that, in the context of the narrative, he wished to explore questions such as How are we ever to disarm evil and abolish death as a means to an end? How are we ever to break the cycle of violence and rage? Can terror coexist with justice? Can hate engender anything but hate?The short novel, less than eighty pages, is a first person narrative of Elisha, an eighteen year old Jewish boy, survivor of the death camps, who has been recruited to Palestine to fight in a terrorist organization, whose aim is to force the British out, as a step towards the creation of the Zionist state.The story is powerfully told, very foreboding. On one page I wrote \u201cmagical realism?\u201d, and then immediately amended that to \u201cmystical realism\u201d. Yes, there are many references to mystical beliefs of the narrator - as well as to mystical experiences. Elisha brings us into his disturbing, and perhaps crazy, dreamworld.The story races to its conclusion much as a dark, ominous thunderstorm descends out of a hot summer sky.. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .Previous review: All's Well That Ends WellRandom review: Organization ManNext review: The World As I Found ItPrevious library review: The Kingdom PreviewNext library review: As God Commands Niccol\u00f2 Ammaniti",
            "When I first read Dawn, I found it a very compelling story that encased a perhaps insoluble moral dilemma, upon rereading it, I now find Elie Wiesel's novella a kind of parable attempting to relate the sometimes incalculable difference between good &amp, evil. The brief book hadn't changed &amp, I doubt that I had appreciably changed as well but sometimes (often) taking a 2nd glance at anything reveals aspects that seemed previously less than apparent.An 18 year old named Elisha is assigned to murder a seemingly innocent British army captain, John Dawson, who is reckoned to be calm, brave, handsome &amp, with fine hands. In so doing, Elisha, who finds it impossible to hate the man he is about to murder, is about to also kill the child within himself. Dawson has been captured while walking through Jerusalem, the home of countless non-Jewish Palestinians but an area the Zionists wish to claim as their territory in a future Israeli state, now under a British Mandate for Palestine. The act is also seen as reprisal for the death of a Jewish partisan named David Ben Moshe. But Elisha is seen as a non-combatant, someone who hopes to study at the Sorbonne...The study of philosophy attracted me because I wanted to understand the meaning of the events of which I had been the victim. In the concentration camp, I had cried out in sorrow &amp, anger against God &amp, also against man, who seemed only to have inherited the cruelty of his creator. I was anxious to re-evaluate my revolt in an atmosphere of detachment, to view it in terms of the present. Where is God to be found? Is it in suffering or in rebellion? When is man most truly a man--when he submits or when he refuses? Does suffering lead him to purification or to bestiality?But as the would-be executioner standing in the cell, considers the sitting man he is about to murder, he has doubts about his role. Was God present somewhere in the room? And is the lack of hate between executioner &amp, John Dawson, somehow a sign of God? When Elisha comments that he is named after a disciple of Elijah, someone who restored life to a little boy by breathing into his mouth, Dawson smiles &amp, comments you're doing the opposite. Elisha admires Dawson's stature &amp, especially his hands, asking if he had ever been a sculptor or perhaps a surgeon. Dawson, who has a son at Cambridge University, asks for permission to write a farewell note to his son. And while the man writes, Elisha attempts to develop hate for his captive but admits, I did not hate him at all but I wanted to hate him, which would have made his situation much easier. He thinks to himself that...hate--like faith or love or war--justifies everything.As the minutes tick away, Elisha expects John Dawson to grow increasingly nervous. But the man continues to smile and even suggests that he feels sorry for Elisha, confounding the executioner, who orders him not to smile. Elisha asks Dawson why he is smiling, telling him that he can't shoot a man who is smiling. Dawson responds: I'm smiling because all of a sudden it has occurred to me that I don't know why I am dying. And after a moment of silence, he added, Do you? After a last cigarette, Dawson having declined the pack because he won't have need of the remainder, Elisha shoots Dawson, commenting that there was pain in his head &amp, his body was growing heavy. The shot had left him deaf &amp, dumb. That's it, Elisha says to himself. It's done. I've killed. I've killed Elisha.The night lifted, leaving behind a grayish light the color of stagnant water. Soon, there was the tattered fragment of darkness, hanging in midair. Fear caught my throat. The tattered fragment of darkness had a face. Looking at it, I understood the reason for my fear. The face was my own.For me, Elie Wiesel's Dawn raises the issue not of the banality of evil, to borrow Hannah Arendt's phrasing but rather, the ambiguity of evil as well perhaps as the ambiguity of goodness. Can a good man commit an evil act &amp, still be a good man?? With thoughts of Elie Wiesel, with whom he shared a long dialogue, Francois Mauriac comments in his excellent preface to The Night Trilogy:Have we ever thought about the consequence of a horror that, though less apparent, less striking than the other outrages, is yet the worst of all to those who have faith--the death of God in the soul of a child who suddenly discovers absolute evil. *My version of the Night Trilogy was published by Hill &amp, Wang, not shown at Goodreads in the 3 component parts &amp, so I have chosen to list a different version for my review of Dawn.",
            "Perhaps it's my fault for assuming that 'Dawn' was a follow up to Wiesel's brilliant memoir 'Night'. Or perhaps the book was just boring. Well written, but boring.In my view, 'Dawn' should not be packaged as the second part of a trilogy, because I did not get any sense of continuation, there was a lot of philosophising but no real sense of transition from the night that was Wiesel's life in a concentration camp to dawn in the Promised Land. I felt that there were a number of gaps. It has certainly put me off reading the third part of the 'trilogy'. ",
            "3 and 1/2 starsThough this is a novella, it's sometimes marketed as part of a trilogy with the nonfictional Night. I can see the relevance, as Wiesel himself says in this book's introduction that he imagined what might've happened if he'd been recruited after his Holocaust experiences to become a terrorist in Palestine. And while I didn't find this as affecting as the memoir Night, it is still relevant, imagining the kind of young person that might become a murderer for a cause and the toll that would take on his psyche. The mystical elements and some beautiful lines are what stood out for me."

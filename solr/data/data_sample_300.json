        "desc": "Danto simply and entertainingly traces the evolution of the concept of beauty over the past century and explores how it was removed from the definition of art. Beauty then came to be regarded as a serious aesthetic crime, whereas a hundred years ago it was almost unanimously considered the supreme purpose of art. Beauty is not, and should not be, the be-all and end-all of art, but it has an important place, and is not something to be avoided.,Danto draws eruditely upon the thoughts of artists and critics such as Rimbaud, Fry, Matisse, the Dadaists, Duchamp, and Greenberg, as well as on that of philosophers like Hume, Kant, and Hegel. Danto agrees with the dethroning of beauty as the essence of art, and maintains with telling examples that most art is not, in fact, beautiful. He argues, however, for the partial rehabilitation of beauty and the removal of any critical taboo against beauty. Beauty is one among the many modes through which thoughts are presented to human sensibility in art: disgust, horror, sublimity, and sexuality being among other such modes.",

            "Arthur C. Danto (1924-2013) was an American philosopher and art critic who taught at Columbia University and devoted many years to following the New York art scene and writing on contemporary art and art history. \u2018The Abuse of Beauty: Aesthetics and the Concept of Art\u2019 consists of an introduction and seven essays, each essay addressing a different facet of Danto\u2019s take on art, philosophy of art, art history and beauty. Introduction: The Aesthetics of the Brillo Box 1) Beauty and the Philosophical Definition of Art 2) The Intractable Avant-Garde 3) Beauty and Beautification 4) Internal and External Beauty 5) Beauty and Politics 6) Three Ways to Look at Art 7) The Beautiful and the Sublime.  To offer a flavor of what one will encounter in these pages, below are several comments along with author\u2019s quotes from the introductory essay, the essay providing the tone and context for the entire collection.Danto came to New York and Columbia University\u2019s philosophy department in the early 1950s. He tells us he was required to study aesthetics and enjoyed the work of the city\u2019s Abstract Expressionists, but couldn\u2019t see the connection between what he was learning at school and the actual art produced by those artists. So, aligning himself with the university\u2019s analytic philosophers, he concerned himself with philosophy\u2019s connection with science and language. But then something interesting happened in the art word \u2013 the artists of the 1960s completely turned their backs on the type of art produced by the Abstract Expressionists. These new artists created in fresh, bold, revolutionary and even anti-aesthetic ways. As Danto writes, \u201cIt was as if (the new art) and analytic philosophy were made for one another. Both were indifferent to edification and exaltation, both appealed to a kind of hard-edge thinking. It was for me a particularly exhilarating moment. I would have had no interest in being an artist in the new period. But I found it intoxicating to be a philosopher of art when art had shuffled off all the heavy metaphysical draperies the Abstract Expressionists were happy to wear as their intellectual garments, and were content to produce works that looked for all the world like commonplace objects of daily life.\u201dAnyone familiar with 20th century American art knows the most famous (and infamous) Pop Art looking like a commonplace object \u2013 Andy Warhol\u2019s Brillo cartons. It was this desire to erase the division between fine art and everyday objects by Pop Artists like Warhol (and which hearkens back to the Readymades of Marcel Duchamp) that obsessed Danto. With his prime interest in language and the philosophical definition of art, Danto was the right philosophical man at the right time. Ironically, Danto sees aesthetics at work on some level since the Brillo boxes were more pleasing and enjoyable to look at than the other Warhol boxes, for instance, the Heinz Ketchup boxes. To underscore this visual enjoyment, Danto cites how, after a lifetime of living with all those drab government-issued boxes, the underground Soviet artists found the Pop Art absolutely beautiful! However, this being said, Danto notes the reality of modern art when he writes, \u201cThe philosophical conception of aesthetics was almost entirely dominated by the idea of beauty, and this was particularly the case in the 18th century \u2013 the great age of aesthetics \u2013 when apart from the sublime, the beautiful was the only aesthetic quality actively considered by artists and thinkers. And yet beauty has almost entirely disappeared from artistic reality in the twentieth century, as if attractiveness was somehow a stigma, with its crass commercial implications.\u201dThe 7 essays that follow address various phases and dimensions of modern Western culture\u2019s expression of art and beauty (and lack of beauty), particularly in the 20th century. But please be aware, the world Danto is speaking about here is the art world contained within museum walls and the ideas he delineates are from post-enlightenment and modern philosophers, most notably David Hume, Immanuel Kant, G.F.W. Hegel, Roger Fry and G.E. Moore. What constitutes the cultural world for the mass of people, things like film, television and sports, are not even mentioned. Perhaps as a way to pique interest in this carefully thought-out book, I will quote the last lines from the last essay on \u2018Beauty and Sublimity\u2019: \u201cBeauty is an option for art and not a necessary condition. But it is not an option for life. It is a necessary condition for life as we would want to live it. That is why beauty, unlike the other aesthetic qualities, the sublime included, is a value.\u201d",
            "As concepts of aesthetics move through the centuries and as people mostly know Aristotle and Kant I find it fascinating to move further and beyond to time, when the concept of beauty changes, at least in aesthetics, rapidly. Arthur C. Dantos piece on aesthetics of art and the concepts themselves is a piece every art student must read and every nerd should consider. ",
            "Except that it is a little repetitive I liked it a lot.A flock would be about the Spanish edition that I have read: I find it amazing to publish a book about art with just 4 small photos in black and white. (Lyotard's pumps make me grace more).",
            "Great book. Full of thoughts on beauty and its place in art.A lot of repetition within.",
            "A great redefinition of beauty paper in art.He believed that he was going to be more dense philosophically, but past the first chapter, prose is a delight.",

            "This is a wonderful book! Just right for reading to your 5-year-old or for your independent reader who is excited about reading chapter books. The illustrations are beautiful, the print is easy to read, and the story is heartwarming and adventurous. I use it for tutoring with my dyslexic students who need interesting visuals, text that is not intimidating, and a story that will keep them motivated to continue reading. The social themes are present but not heavy, so I can choose how in depth a discussion to have about them with students. The cast of characters range from comical to evil, yet Tua and Pohn Pohn are the stars - endearing characters with a special connection to each other that you'll love from the start. Harris writes with the voice of a true world citizen, yet as you read, it's not hard to imagine that he is telling this story to his nieces and nephews gathered at his knee. My students and I hope that R.P. Harris continues to write stories for us! ",
            "Plot: This book is about a young thai girl named tua who one day whilst looking around the night market in her home town while her mum is working, finds herself in an unfamiliar part of town. There she is shocked and moved to see the mistreatment of an elephant by its owners . The next thing Tua knows, she and the elephant are running away being pursued by the bad guys and looking for a place where Pohn-Pohn (as the elephant is soon named) will be safe. Friends, relatives, and perfect strangers get involved in the cause, to a thrilling and comic effect. Message of the book: I think many young girls and boys would want to identify with the intrepid character of Tua who will give up at nothing to save her Pohn Pohn. Her courage to fight for what is right in the face of hardship from the adults around is inspirational to any young reader. The help from interesting characters on the way particularly with \u2018Auntie Orchid\u2019, provide many funny moments for the young reader keeping this book pacey and engaging. How it can be used: Harris touches on serious social issues (children living in dumps and mothers begging with infants), but ear tweaking and nose yanking are about as violent as it gets for the humans. This makes it good for use in lower KS2 PSHE lessons about family and about how we should treat each other. The histories of the elephants at the sanctuary are horrifying, but are firmly in the past, with the elephants living happily in the present. This could be easily integrated into a world histories lesson and the great Thai backdrop to this story makes it perfect for a geographical study into life in Thailand. I would recommend this book for use in year 2, 3 or 4. ",
            "Everyone in Tua\u2019s little village in Thailand loves her. She weaves her way among the market stalls while her mother is at work, getting attention from vendors her know her as their little \u201cpeanut.\u201d But when Tua sees an elephant being mistreated, she knows she must save her from the cruel men who own her. But how can she steal an elephant, and what will she do with the elephant once she has her?Tua and the Elephant is the delightful story of a little girl who bonds with an elephant and sets her mind to help her. Tua names her elephant Pohn-Pohn, and she feels she can communicate with her. Pohn-Pohn\u2019s abusive owners have evil intentions, but they are mostly inept and can\u2019t seem to overcome the forces of good Tua has on her side.This sweet story delves into issues of friendship, courage to follow your heart, and the plight of Thailand\u2019s elephants. I highly recommend it for mother-daughter book clubs with girls aged 9 to 12.The publisher provided me with a copy of this book to review. ",

            "Cute story about a girl who rescues and elephant. I think my kids will enjoy this book when they're older.",
            "Tua and the Elephant by R. P. HarrisI read this as a Library E Book on my Kindle through my County Library. I could only get this as a Library E Book which was fine with me. This is a really cute story about a little girl named Tua who rescues a Elephant and she names him Pon Pon. I dearly love this story. It is a young children's - middle grade story. I would highly recommend this book. There are 29 Chapters to this book but the chapters are rather short. It reads pretty fast too. I give this book 5/5 StarsHappy Reading :)"

            "This book was probably one of the slower ones I've read. I say that because introducing us to the conflict took too long to get going. Once the rising action started it was mostly just explaining things that will hopefully be more fulfilled in part two. Once I reached the end with about 30 pages left I finally felt the fast-paced action that I loved in the other books. The story was very intricate and detailed, however, I am still missing a few of the details for some things that were introduced. I loved the character development that took place in all of them, but especially Meagan. She really started to change for the better, while keeping her personality intact. Overall I liked the book.",
            "In the 5th installment of the Tennis Shoes Series, Harry Hawkins embarks on an adventure to grant his sister\u2019s final wish \u2013 find her true love, Marcos the Nephite and send him to her. Megan Sorenson, Harry\u2019s new and annoying sister-in-law joins Harry on his journey. Together, they discover a secret about Frost Cave and the passage to the world of the past. Instead of ending up in Nephite lands as planned, the two wind up in the contentious world of Jerusalem in 1st Century AD. Can they keep themselves alive in this troubled world and can Harry find Marcos in time to send him back to Melody before it is too late?This book presents an interesting look into historical fiction because it traces back to Nephite and early 1st Century Jerusalem cultures. It is obvious the author has done his research and readers are able to contrast the differences between the modern world and the old world, laughing as the characters use modern tools (everything from pencils, flashlights, and cd-players) to trade for goods and services. Both the modern and historical characters seem quite real and are well developed, helping to make the story more interesting and believable. This book would be good for those who like historical fiction and LDS fiction in particular. ",
            "Harry Hawkins fills the role of narrator and sounds exactly like his dad. Meagan \u2013 his bratty, soon-to-be stepsister \u2013 fills the role of Garth \u2013 being the knowledgeable and book-learned expositor or plot knowledge. Meagan, however is interestingly mouthy and snotty but with a witty personality. Unfortunately in later books she becomes a clone of Melody just like all the other females in Heimerdinger\u2019s books.This time the person missing is Marcos and for some unexplained reason Melody will die of cancer unless Harry can find him. This takes him back to post-Christ Judeah where he encounters sorcerors, gladiators, slavers and apostate Christians.It really is as disjointed as it sounds. This is because it is the first of a three book story arc and most of these things are setup for events in later books. Interestingly, Harry finds Marcos so that his sister will be okay \u2013 somehow \u2013 and in the process loses Meagan so that there will be another captive/rescue situation in the next book.I really do still enjoy these books but it\u2019s interesting to me how many times he can repeat the same formula with only slightly newer characters and more exotic locations and times.",
            "Chris Heimerdinger does a marvelous job of painting a picture that puts you there with the right feeling. This book departs from the Nephite civilization to the time right after Christ's crucifixion in the Holy Land yet adds a connection with several of the old folks from the Nephites. What a marvelous novel. I have checked out the next four books in the series to read over the summer and the first volume as my wife wants to join in now. A fascinating part of the book is how the author shows how the scrolls can be manipulated by copying them thus showing how parts of the Bible could have been lost or changed. He also shows well how apostate groups work and how the needs and frailties of men play into the hands of the leaders of these apostate groups and how the leaders and people fall prey to the mandates of the era they live in. This shows to me how fortunate we are to still have the fullness of the gospel and how delicate was the situation of the prophet Joseph Smith in restoring the gospel and true Church of Jesus Christ.",
            "Oh. I forgot how these books don't actually reach a resolution at the end of the book, jsut at the end of the quest. Nerve-wracking. I really just need to read the next one ASAP. I am left hanging and I don't like it and won't tolerate it unless I have to.I love how the stakes go up in this quest and the author skillfully keeps us from becoming bored by alwasy introducing more chracters an plot twists which could be annoying. *cough*michael scott's Alchemist series* But I never feel overloaded with these books, (excep tfor when you start the next book without remembering what happened in the last one). Really great, but remember that there is no resolution, and I really want the next one now!"

            "Very disappointing. I have no idea how Ahuja got access to the people featured in this book - most of them are reknowned for shunning the spotlight - but given this access the author has done a complete disservice to the subject matter. It's basically a lazy effort, a handful of interviews with each person spliced together with content taken from other books and articles. The nine personalities, each of whom probably deserve their own book, barely extend to 200 pages of large font typeface and wide spacing. The padded-out feel is exacerbated by the amount of space devoted to each candidates current market views - nothing dates a book quicker. I got the feeling that the author was a little out of her depth as often her attempts to summarise conversations made little sense and were made without context or analysis. One such passage is in fact duplicated word-for-word five pages apart in the Dalio section (shame on you John Wiley &amp, Sons)! Without wanting to sound too snobby, this reads like a someone with a television background interviewing a series of high-profile hedge fund leaders - it's fluffy, light and a bit sychophantic, as you would expect from someone working at CNBC. If you want content, I would recommend More Money than God or even the Quants - both far better books, on every level. Having said all that, the one saving grace was the afterword by Myron Scholes. He takes issue with the title of the book, claiming that most of these so called Alpha masters are more like Omega merchants - paid to take risk in one form or another - an argument which I thought was slightly strained but insightful.",
            "Not bad. The author manages to corral and interview a pretty impressive collection of hedge fund managers for the meat of this book. I enjoyed learning about their backgrounds and how they started their funds, but as Myron Scholes points out in the afterword, the text is almost a People magazine featuring hedgies (this is a phenomenon which I believe has afflicted the Wall Street Journal over the last half decade: the focus on mansions and Benzes as opposed to investment process and market commentary). Scholes, of Black-Scholes option pricing model fame, goes on to question the author's title, he notes that these managers are not masters of alpha so much as omega, which he describes as having the market bend to one's will by offering the ability for participants to transfer risk and by providing liquidity. As you can tell from this review, I found the 5-page afterword the most useful part of the book - maybe start there.",
            "The book covers Ray Dalio, Pierre LaGrange, Tim Wong, David Tepper, Bill Ackman, Dan Loeb, Jim Chanos very well and their investment philosophies. The book has a number of investment lessons on temperament, style, and execution.This is one of the very few books that talk about Appaloosa\u2019s David Tepper who I find very interesting as a money manager myself. There\u2019s just so much to learn from him and thanks to the author for interviewing him.I feel there\u2019s a lot of missing facts on the book on managers like John Paulson. A book that does justice to him is Greg Zuckerman\u2019s \u201cThe greatest trade ever\u201d as well as Michael Lewis\u2019 famous \u201cBig Short\u201d.Naturally after reading this book you\u2019d also want to follow it up with the two books I mention above and throw in \u201cMore money than God\u201d and \u201cSeth Klarman\u2019s Margin of Safety\u201d for control.",

            "Maneet Ahuja has come from almost nowhere to fame after writing The Alpha Masters: Unlocking the Genius of the World's Top Hedge Funds describing the most famous hedge fund managers globally. Her ability to get access to these gentlemen and making interviews full of insights is nothing but remarkable. Ms Ahuja is born 1984 and has been covering hedge funds at CNBC since 2008. She is often delivering breaking news, the most recent example was in December 2012 when she was first to report that Bill Ackman had a short position in Herbalife and considered their business model to be a pyramid scheme.Ms Ahuja starts out by giving the reader an account of who she is and how she managed to write this book. It\u2019s very interesting and impressive, to say the least. From there on she paints nine portraits of some of the most well- known hedge fund investors in several segments: long/short equity, global macro, distressed debt, activist and short only. Every chapter gives you a background of the alpha master, his upbringing, how he raised his first money and then presents you with some examples of how his strategy works. It\u2019s a very entertaining and easy to read concept, but often it\u2019s a little bit too much of background and too little alpha insight. The foreword is written by Mohamed El Erian and the afterword by Myron Scholes.The alpha masters have truly outstanding track records. I knew of all but one of them before and in various ways I have followed their success. My favourites, both before and after reading the book, are Ray Dalio and David Tepper. These two chapters stand out from the rest so I will focus on them below.Ray Dalio is probably the world\u2019s most famous hedge fund manager and of the most famous money manager all categories. The chapter about him is worth the entire book, not least his personal story - how he became who he is. He is (in)famous for the white paper Principles, which is made up of 200 life- management- and investment guidelines. It\u2019s all about pursuing the truth and learning from mistakes. In 2004 Mr Dalio wrote Engineering Targeted Returns and Risk where he describes something that he calls Post modern portfolio theory, which he used when he launched his All Weather Portfolio. Over its life span it has outperformed the regular 60/40, stock/bond allocation with less than half the risk. What is behind his fantastic achievements? Dalio and Bridgewater are doing a lot of quantative research, but they do not simply look at it from a purely mathematical point of view but also make sure that the underlying drivers of investment ideas truly are uncorrelated. Dalio thinks that the best mix of assets is an amalgam of different things, currencies, bonds and common stocks. His focus is on finding 15 or more good uncorrelated bets and leverage these three to four times. This is his recipe for a very good risk adjusted return.David Tepper has returned an average of 28 percent net of fees since 1993, albeit with high volatility. His fund Appaloosa has lost around 25 percent three times and made it up in six months every time. Why does he himself think he has been so successful? Key is to be value oriented and to not be afraid of losing money. Some of Tepper\u2019s best positions were the ones he initially lost a lot of money on. The reason he can pursue this strategy, which very few can, is his set up. 55 percent of his firm\u2019s assets are held by himself and his partners and he is allowed to lock up 75 percent of the assets for a period of up to three years. Most cannot accept this withdrawal optionality, those who can do constitute a very stable client base that facilitates rational asset management. I really look forward to whatever Ms Ahuja is up to next.",
            "The Alpha Masters, while moderately entertaining, disappointed from a substance perspective. The descriptions of the funds, managers and their strategies dwell on common knowledge. For example, there is outstanding and detailed information all over the web about Ray Dalio (the person), his All Weather and Pure Alpha funds. In fact, far better, more detailed and more engaging than The Alpha Masters. The same holds true for Ms. Ahuja's descriptions of the other funds and managers. The book was not bad....it just was not a compelling read. ",
            "Expected much more detailed and technical information about the Masters strategies and investing philosophy. However, is a very entertaining and inspiring book to read while reading the alpha generators' path to success. ",
            "Good guide for introductory purposes. For knowledgeable veterans, the book may be stating the obvious. I personally learnt a lot and it made me curious for another book, thanks to one of the chapters (the one about Bill Ackman). "

        "desc": "This spellbinding centenary biography by Neil Powell looks at the music, the life, and the legacy of the greatest British composer of the twentieth century,Benjamin Britten was born on November 22, 1913, in the East Suffolk town of Lowestoft. Displaying a passion and proficiency for music at an early age, to the delight of his mother, Edith, a talented amateur musician herself, he began composing music when he was only five years old. After studying at the Royal College of Music, Britten went on to write documentary scores for the General Post Office Film Unit, where he met and collaborated with the poet W. H. Auden.,Of more lasting importance was Britten's introduction in 1937 to the tenor Peter Pears, who was to become the inspirational center of his emotional and musical life. Their partnership lasted nearly four decades, during a dangerous time when homosexuality was illegal in England. Conscientious objectors, Britten and Pears followed Auden to America before the war began in 1939. While there, they joined the extraordinary Brooklyn m\u00c3\u00a9nage of George Davis, Louis MacNeice, and Paul Bowles.,Eventually intense homesickness, provoked in part by George Crabbe's poem \"Peter Grimes,\" drove the pair home to East Anglia in 1942 and gave Britten the inspiration for his finest opera. Throughout his career, Britten did not want modern music to be just for \"the cultured few\" and instead always composed his music to be \"listenable-to.\" The shared quotidian lives of Britten and Pears unfold in this intimate biography and the story of two men who created a truly remarkable legacy.",

            "Much of Neil Powell's biography seems a one-sided, flattened and defensive hagiography when it is not merely a grim mustering of facts. His Britten all but walks on water. This fawning volume may be the right biography for the Aldeburgh Festival to stock in its gift shop.Those with a serious interest in Britten will want to look elsewhere.Read our review:http://www.washingtonpost.com/enterta...",
            "As a composer and as a voice for the arts, Benjamin Britten was a monumental figure for music and for the Arts in England during the 20th Century. His compositions, lasting provisions for musicians, and his operas are all enduring legacies, as is the simple goodness that all who knew him seem to attest to. Coming into this biography, I knew him as a sometime contemporary of W.H. Auden who was also the composer of the operas based on James' Turn of the Screw and Mann's Death in Venice, and somewhere I had a passing memory that his compositions often fed off of poetry, such as that of Thomas Hardy, Whitman, and Shakespeare.Powell's biography, though, is ambitious. Moving through Britten's entire life, it undertakes a study of how his life fed off of music, and fed music in return. With constant quotations from Briten's own journals (especially in the first half of the book when his life was not so well documented by others), and with constant attention to what was being written and performed when, Powell's book is many things. It is biography. It is also a monument and a catalogue and a celebration.In truth, there were sections where I found this work to be incredibly slow-moving--the constant attention to what was being written and performed, for who and when and how, and the constant attention to names whose lives intersected with Britten's, however briefly, was sometimes tedious--particularly in the middle portion of the book when Britten's life revolved entirely around his compositions, many of them shorter works, so that the biography sometimes felt like a listing or a cataloguing exercise moreso than prose. (Though, no doubt, this is an impressive bout of research on Powell's part.) And, these sections were probably all the more tedious for me because I am not a musician, or even really versed in the language of orchestras and music theory. Certainly, these sections would have been far more interesting for readers more knowledgeable about these areas or Britten's work in particular. And yet.The beginning of the work so fascinated me, even so detached as it was, that I couldn't help but keep going through these middle reaches of the text, and the final sections of the work more than made up for those few sections where I found myself struggling with any desire to continue. In the end, I so appreciate Powell's careful objectiveness, and his care in staying away from the more media-driven scandals which were sometimes associated with Britten's name in the press (primarily because of homophobia and/or suspicions regarding his pacifist nature) which, really, had little to no basis in Britten's reality.On the whole, this work does have its faults, but it is also a fascinating study of a leading composer of the twentieth century and a man who, very simply, ensured that his life revolved around music, from beginning to end. For those interested, it will be a worthwhile read."

            "Saw this book browsing through a bookstore in London on a trip, and I bought it for my son, who is a cellist and a fan of Britten's music. Curious about it, I started to read the first few pages and became totally hooked. It's a superb and very fair, if sympathetic, study of the man: his life, his friendships, his family, his aspirations, his accomplishments, his many strengths, and a few glaring weaknesses. Powell carried out impeccable research for the book, and while not a professional musician, he is deeply informed about classical music and Britten's music specifically. He offers opinions about many of Britten's pieces, but does not trying to clinically analyze them, which on the whole is a positive approach. This is, after all, a biography, not a book on music theory. What we learn most about is Britten the man. And what comes through loud and clear is what a good person Britten was. His longtime partner, Peter Pears, made a telling comment after Britten died, one that Powell passes along: How could such a good man not make great music? Well, Pears should know, as the two were married for over three decades. And, think about it. It is a telling comment. How many other composers, to say nothing of writers, painters, architects, dancers, etc. would you say the same thing about? Probably not too many. They made great art because they were good, not in spite of being good (or not good)? Britten's goodness comes through loud and clear. More than anything, he seems to have been a naturally warm, naturally honest, and naturally understated person. Most of all--and this is Powell's biggest point--Britten completely identified with the small, unassuming coastal community in which he was raised, always loved, and eventually moved back to (albeit part-time). As a professional composer, talented pianist, and superb conductor of his own music, he had to been in London frequently, and he also had to travel quite a bit abroad. But he never personally identified with London or any other metropolitan center, more like he put up with them. I can totally relate. In that regard, Britten is a man after my own heart. At the end of the book, Powell flat out admits that he considers Britten to be the most important composer in British history and easily among the best world composers of the 20th century. I don't know enough to say whether that's accurate, but I can say--having read this book with pleasure--that it's a terrible tragedy Britten died so (relatively) young. (Early sixties.) He certainly had more great music in him. (He composed right up until the end.) And he would been a hell of an interesting person to meet. ",
            "Though a bit more technical in places than I could really be comfortable with, this is an excellent, instructive account of Britten\u2018s life. Recommended.",
            "Powell wants us to believe that Benjamin Britten was a good man. I will happily say that he wrote a great deal of beautiful and technically excellent music, which I have enjoyed hearing and singing. Factors that complicate a full life judgment are his ambiguous relationships with young boys, and his constant co-opting and twisting of poetry and texts from the religious soul of England, and infusing them with meaning and subtext far afield from what they ought to mean. (Imagine a lightly edited performance of Britten's Billy Budd by the Westboro Baptist Church to gain a sense of the impropriety.) Powell presents a Britten who repeatedly gives religious people what they want, both through his music and through his outward piety, but the core is hollow, he offers up homosexuality in the clothes of Christianity.This book tilts toward hagiography, and certainly presents a sympathetic Britten throughout. Powell occasionally wanders into special pleading, assuring us on no apparent grounds whatsoever that any negative judgments of Britten's life and work are misguided. Just trust him.Frequently, Powell tries to edit Britten: He surely..., He would have.... It is as if he believes that wants to usher into a place of privileged access to his subject's mind and way of thinking, but instead of demonstrating such from Britten's writing or life, we are stuck trusting Powell. A sad biographer's shortcut.Auden features so largely that one gets the impression that Powell wishes he were writing the poet's biography instead. Surely Auden had a profound impact on Britten, surely one could have written a duography if one wanted.A negative consequence of Britten's homosexuality (which Powell interestingly mirrors at times in his own authorial attitude) is his failure to understand or appreciate family life and its importance to those he worked with. Several relationships strained or broke because Britten's colleagues had their priorities in life straighter that Britten was able to comprehend. Powell gives a great deal of credit to Britten's mother for his musicality, but he manifests an annoyance with her for requiring of Britten love and care in her later years. If only she had been out of the way, Britten could have got more music done!Powell's own musical abilities far outstrip my own, but when he prefaces things with a statement of his own limitations at reading complicated music, it profoundly weakens any musical judgments offered later.The closing personal reminiscences of the author are perfect for prefacing a reading at the bookstore, they sit uncomfortably in the main text of the book. The biographer has given way to the fan before the book ended, and this is for the worse.The subject and his story are truly fascinating, but they deserve a more professional telling, because Benjamin Britten was a good musician.I received an ARC of Benjamin Britten: A Life for Music as part of the Librarything Early Reviewers program.",
            "The genius of Benjamin Britten's (BB) music is attested to by masterpieces ranging from the operatic (Peter Grimes), his song cycles, his magnificent War Requiem and his symphonic and chamber music including his great Solo Cello Suites, comparable only to Bach's. What is astonishing is that it comes into plain view in his very earliest formal work, Quatre Chansons Fran\u00e7aises, a song cycle composed at the tender age of 14. Very few talents in music history have revealed their hand so early and decisively. The intersections of his public sentiments and private life, a pacifist openly living with his partner Peter Pears at a time when homosexuality was a criminal offense, brought much antipathy if not outright hostility. Writing in a tonal idiom at a time when the Western music establishment became firmly wedded to a serialist modernity did not help either. The occasion of his centenary (2013) offers a chance to take the full measure of his art and life. Published on the occasion of the centenary, Neil Powell's biography follows in great details and in chronological order the life of BB. There is much to learn about his solid middle class background, early musical life influences including those of his mother and his teacher the composer Frank Bridge, his sexuality and the evolution of his music. The biography does not delve too deep into his music, as would be expected from a work aiming at a wider audience. It has hits and misses, the former including the wealth of biographical details it provides, especially those of his early life. To my mind however, it fails to have deeper insights into those key encounters and influences that have shaped his art. For example, I was very interested in his relationship with Auden, given that it was relevant to his art, especially in relation to poetry, and his sexuality. One great song cycle of Britten penned early in his career, Our Hunting Fathers, was the product of this collaboration. Yet another key interaction later in life was that with Dmitri Shostakovich. Both artists have been significantly influenced by this relationship, despite the language barrier. Shostakovich's 14th symphony was dedicated to BB, while BB's The Prodigal Son was dedicated to Shostakovich. The analyses of both of those encounters and their significance was superficial, mired in listing events rather than unraveling their deeper significance. There is a hagiographic sentiment that infects the narrative which at times lessens from its impact. Overall a good biography, but one that fell short of being a definitive artistic and intellectual one. ",
            "(I would really give this book 3.5 stars)This new biography of Britten is well-written and provides a lot of information on his life. The great strength of this book is Powell's clear, engaging writing and how much his liking for Britten and his music comes through. Powell provides a very positive and admiring view of Britten, but thankfully avoids either over-idealizing the man or awkwardly trying to turn human flaws into great man virtues in the manner of Einstein's biography of Mozart. However, since Powell is not a musicologist, the focus is firmly on the events and trajectory of Britten's life, not on his compositional developments or on analysis of his music. This lack is my only serious criticism of the book, since I often find it illuminating to have the biographical and musicological threads intertwined. I especially would have liked some more in-depth analytical discussion of how some of the major events ad experiences of Britten's life may have affected his music, especially his experiences seeing Belsen after the war, which Britten himself said affected every thing he wrote afterwards. Nonetheless, this was a solid biography, full of good writing and interesting observations.I received this book for free through a Goodreads giveaway."

            "3.5 Stars - Good bookAs you might expect with a short-story collection, some are winners and some are losers. The winners were fantastic, and the losers... well, they're they made the reading experience less enjoyable. The rating is an average of the ratings of every individual story and then divided by the number of stories in the book - 44 to be exact. My favorite story in the collection is one quite early-on and one of the shorter one's in the book - Sailor off the Bremen by Irwin Shaw. The story was originally published in The New Yorker on February 25, 1939. This one tells the story of Ernest, who received a brutal beating from a pro-Nazi aboard the Bremen after a Communist demonstration. Ernest's brother and sister-in-law take revenge into their own hands after hearing his story. This one is my favorite because it is beautifully and simply written. Shaw effectively tells the story that Fascism, Nazism, is disgusting on an individual scale. He also was able to humanize the villain, which not every writer can successfully do. I also appreciate how Shaw didn't portray the Communist's as perfect or the ideal opposition to Fascism. From my understanding, Shaw was left-leaning but I thought this particular story was more centrist - perhaps slightly left leaning. My least favorite story is The Whore of Mensa by Woody Allen. I mean, he's despicable. Do I need to say more?My runner-up for favorite is A Sentimental Journey by Peter Taylor.Do I recommend this? Probably yeah. I'd advise to at least skim through it to see if any stories or authors peak your interest.",
            "Maybe the New Yorker fiction section is not for me. Too many of the stories were of the John Cheever Saul Bellow Philip Roth John Updike kind, in which a middle aged man puts on his raincoat and leaves his office and gets on the train to Scarsdale and reminisces about an affair he had, and then gets off the train. Maybe its good that I don't get these stories, because maybe that means I don't share their life of middle aged desperation. Maybe.On the other hand, there's the always funny Sj Perelman.",

The lesser discussed topic around 'hermit' fans who perhaps cut it out not to keep it for themselves, but to destroy it because of J.D.Salinger and his very clear restrictions regarding the printing of his material.Anyway...There are some really great short stories in here. I find an interesting trend that there is a lot of mention of therapists and mental health. I feel like everyone in New York has a therapist.

            "This is a fantastic, highly detailed overview of the history of the English language in which I learned some surprising things, such as:--they, their, and them, our plural pronouns, were a Scandinavian (specifically Danish) import. Old English conjugated them as hie, hiera, him.--In fact, the Danish invasions of England prior to the Norman Conquest probably contributed a lot more to our loss of inflection (word endings) than the French influence on our language ever did. While we borrowed a lot of words from the Norman French, we adapted our syntax to the Scandinavian model, so that our language became much simpler in terms of inflection compared to say, German or Latin. --Also, Middle English grew out of a lack of regulation/caring on the part of the Norman invaders, who kept speaking their own version of French while the English middle/lower classes spoke a rapidly evolving (and unchecked) form of English.--We can thank the 18th century (Enlightenment period) for many of our more restrictive grammar rules of today, for instance, lay/lie, between you and I, between/among, different from versus different than, etc. This was also the period in which a grammarian named Robert Lowth condemned the double-negative, a construction often used by Shakespeare, but now deemed grammatically incorrect (as though English were equivalent to algebra!)--When a grammarian makes people stick to certain grammatical rules, this is called prescriptive grammar.-- Prescriptivists like to assert rules for everything, from how a word should be used based on its etymology to how it should be used based on its usage in Greek or Latin, and even to how it should appear based on analogy (for example, if you write backwards and forwards, you should also write afterwards and homewards.) Gah, I kind of detest these 18th century guys. They ruin all the fun that writers like Shakespeare had with English--Shakespeare, who molded the tongue like clay, coining and using more words than almost anyone else in the Elizabethan period. Basically, this text confirms that English is an ever-changing, ever-living language, growing and morphing, adapting and revising itself according to the needs and circumstances of those who speak it. What lives cannot be contained, it can only be described in each successive moment of its appearance--that's our language, and we should be proud that whatever grammatical boxes we place it in, it always manages to break out of."

Some of the hymns came about in ways that are quite dramatic and personal; others came into being under ordinary circumstances.

Prepared with the cooperation and assistance of the General Music Committee of the Church, this companion to the hymnbook gives brief biographies of the authors and composers of the hymns, the stories of the hymns themselves, and an account of changes that may have ocurred in the words or in the music. Our Latter-day Hymns gives insight into the beliefs and history, hopes and fears of the people who sing these hymns. Church members who have music callings as well as those who simply enjoy singing will find this volume fascinating and informative.",

            "The author has reviewed the history of the LDS hymns, their authors and composers with lots of miscellaneous information that brings the circumstances of their creation to light. A good resource.",
            "Psstt... (I didn't actually read all of this book . . .)The last 120 pages are paragraph biographies of all the composers of the hymns. Biographies are already one of the most boring of literary genres. To then make them composer biographies of music and only a paragraph long makes it not worth my time. I actually tried to skim read them, but by the third one I was done.What I love about this book is that it is a reservoir of personal experiences on how ARTISTS receive and act on revelation. This really should be used as a reference book more than anything, but it did have inspiring stories every twenty hymns or so that made the reading worthwhile. It was really cool to see how these saints had normal, trying experiences that they turned into beautiful music and lyrics. And how these composers and poets did much of the work, but every once and a while had a moment of pure revelation. Or how they would get the main melody and then figure out the rest for themselves, etc. etc. Pretty cool to read and see how the hand of God works on all of His children who diligently, faithfully seek out His glory.

There is a small snippet on author, composer and history on each hymn along with some musical info.",

            "Good reference material. Got bored with the book, shelved it, read some, shelved it, read some, etc. Nearly two years later, done.",
            "For the past year or so I came up with this idea to study the hymns. So here is what I did (this is going to sound really nerdy):I started with the beginning of the hymnbook by reading the introduction. Then from there I sang all verses of the first hymn, looked up the correlating scriptures and then read about that hymn in this \u201cOur Latter-Day Hymns\u201d book. Finally I read the information about the people who wrote the text and the music from the back of the Our Latter-Day Hymns\u201d book. I continued these steps with all the hymns in the English hymnbook.Overall I feel disappointed that I paid $29.95 for this book. The author does warn the reader in her introduction of \u201cOur Latter-Day Hymns\u201d that some of the background stories to the hymns are undramatic. Since quite a few hymns have an undramatic story or really no background story at all, it seems like the author felt like she had to write something about the hymn to fill up some pages and make this book into a big, thick book for $29.95. The author basically repeats the message of the hymn\u2019s text in her own words. She would write things like, \u201cIn verse one we read that\u2026\u201d The other thing that the author would sometimes do is write the scriptures that go with the hymn. But you can read these scripture passage on your own. The correlating scriptures are found at the bottom of each hymn in the hymnbook. This book would have been better if it was reduced to a smaller, more affordable book with just the interesting facts (i.e. It would be nice if she cut out all the \u201cmessages\u201d we can get that from reading or singing the hymn's text. If there is no background story about a certain hymn, she should have just wrote that there is no background story and not write all this fluff about a particular hymn.)For the most part, the book was pretty boring to me and it took me a very long time to get through it. Only on occasion did I read something that was interesting about a hymn and highlighted it in my copy of the book. Yet looking back at my copy, I don\u2019t have a whole lot of highlighted passages. I have a love for Germany, the language, people and culture. So that being said, I thought it was interesting to see the influence German-speaking people had on the hymns.Lastly, I loved reading the short little texts about the people who wrote the music or the text. ",
            "This book is wonderful for anyone who loves the hymns from the Latter Day Saint hymnal. It gives background information on every song and is also a great book for chorister's to refer to when searching for a song on a certain topic. It's also a great reference when teaching a new song. In one ward I attended, the chorister in Relief Society would read the story behind the song we would practice that week. It was so interesting to learn about our hymn's origins before we sang them. It helps you appreciate the hymn's even more."

After these is when I started Thoroughbred. Awe, how I wish I was a kid again so I could go back and read them. I forget what half of them are about anymore...",
            "Personal Response:tI liked this book because it had to do with horses. I also liked it because the pony reminded me of the memories I had of my cousins old horse Jasper. It was also kinda boring because it kept repeating the word \u201clulu.\u201d I give this book four stars because it was good but you could definitely tell it was for little kids.Plot Summary:tIn the beginning of the book Lulu\u2019s dad left to go off to work. She was left to stay with her grandmother. One night she hears her grandmother scream and she sees a pony running around her yard. She gets excited so she decides to follow the pony around the next day. It turns out that a little girl named Anna owned the pony. Curiously she follows Anna and Acorn to find out that there is another little girl named Pam who also has a pony. Sadly Lulu walks away. She goes home and asks her grandmother if she can go for a walk. Adventually she lets Lulu go for a walk. When Lulu is out on the walk she see a white welsh pony. Lulu decides to stay with the pony till later that afternoon. The next day she goes to visit the pony again but she can't find her. She looks around the pasture to find her laying down with barbed wire wrapped around her leg and her side all cut up. The vet comes to fix her up but, the owner of the horse gets all mad at Lulu for causing his horse to hurt itself. Lulu offers to watch over his horse until its leg gets better. Pam and Anna suggest that she should start boarding the horse at Pam's stable until she heals. The owners agree and let Lulu ride the pony also. At the very end Lulu finally gets to ride on the welsh pony named Snow White. Recommendation:tI would recommend this book to any 4th grader or up for a short easy story. This book would also be good for if you wanted to read a little bit about horses. This book makes a quick, easy goodreads. ",

I loved the series so much that I got the little cookbook that Scholastic put out with recipes from one character's mother (she runs the local diner).

His mother dead his father missing Lando has his troubles. Pa, Falcon Sackett left a neighbor with 3 sacks of gold for the raising and schooling of his son Lando, but once it seemed clear that something had happened to Falcon and he wasn't coming back the neighbor stole the money, bought land and schooled his own son with the money meant for Lando.

In his father and mother's old cabin he lived on his own... Now along with an enigmatic traveling peddler and worker The Tinker he's going west to make his fortune.The book has action and once it gets started it rolls along at a good clip with under-handed dealing, bandits, horse racing, prize fighting...and gun fighting. If some books are brain candy this might be brain jerky as it's a western. Maybe not what would be called great literature but pure adventure and a good read. 3.5 if we had half stars. Enjoy.",
            "Entertaing book but not quite up to par with the other books in the Sackett series. It's obvious that there was no birth control in the 1870's because if I can just find one more Sackett brother we'll be able to field a marching band. ",
            "This story of Orlando, Lando Sackett. His story is more \u201cbrutal\u201d and on the wilder side than the Sackett books I\u2019ve read up to this point.His mother dead and his father gone, Lando had to fend for himself since an early age. His father left Lando with his old \u201cfriend\u201d, who was asked to give Lando a proper education. This was to be insured by giving his \u201cfriend\u201d a large sack of gold. Then his father left and disappeared.Of course the money was never spent on Lando, but on the man\u2019s own son, his wife and for purchasing a large cattle ranch. Lando ran away from the abusive family into the mountains where he built a mill. On day a goods peddler shows up on Lando\u2019s doorstep and offers him to accompany him to a distant land. By this time, three brothers who have connection with Lando\u2019s father got the wind of him and are after to him to find out what happened to his father and the missing gold.As Lando travels, he gets into more and more trouble over his father and his \u201ccursed\u201d gold. Sure, Lando makes plenty of bad choices, all stemming from the notion of easy and fast riches, instead of going with his intuition and his heart of making it as a cattle rancher.And when he gets ambushed on the border with Mexico, he sees his friends get killed and he gets thrown into a secret prison, where he is tortured for informing about the treasure.After years of imprisonment, he is saved only by a chance by Texas rangers, who were accidentally at the wrong place.He travels with them back and swears to start anew without any treasure. But the past is fast on his heels, as more people want to know what had happened to his father and where is the location of the hidden gold.Like I said, this was much \u201crougher\u201d story than all the other Sacketts so far. It wasn\u2019t bad, but it wasn\u2019t great either. I wish the characters were a bit more developed and that we got a bit more back story for the main characters. All in all OK Sackett story, if rather a forgettable one. ",
            "This book, after the first two of the Sackett series, is one of my least favorites out of this series. It's not bad, but it just could be better. (Also I have to say, I really hate this cover. It's probably one of my least favorite covers ever.) The plot itself is really good, but I feel like it starts to go downhill towards the end of the novel. The story begins to rush through the years so quickly that, as Lando changes, the reader can't quite keep up, and it feels like you don't really know him anymore. It's kind of a shame, because you felt as though you knew him really well in the beginning, but by the end of the novel you just don't. But the majority of the novel is pretty good, it's only the last 30 pages or so that change his personality, so overall, it's not a bad book. ",
            "Not my favorite one. Lando's personality was a little vague, as was the storyline. After finishing, I couldn't really tell you much about him, other than, that's he's big through the shoulders. Kind of a break from the others where the Sackett became like a close friend by the time the story was over.The hunting for treasure that they never really did get and then the revenge on men that was sort of confused about why they made him angry...it was just all a little thrown together.But Louis sure does a good fight scene. In this book it was boxing, and he just writes them so vividly, they come to life in my mind. "

            "What illiterate wrote these summaries? Do yourself a favor and don't read any of them. They're awful! For one, they all concentrate on the least interesting pieces of the story.Not that the story is that great, sadly. Lando isn't terribly interesting, really. Indeed, the real story is with his father's past. Which means I couldn't help feeling that we missed all the most interesting bits sticking with Lando rather than stepping back twenty years and following Falco from the beginning.Anyway, bad marketing, awful copywriting, and a story that's barely coherent made this a less-than-satisfying read. Toss in that this is the first in the Sackett stories with no love interest whatsoever and you have an almost complete wash.And yes, that means this one takes the title of weakest in the series from Sackett. Tell was a much better hero and his story was more coherent than this one. Which is sad because Lando had a great premise (following in a father's footsteps, finding trouble along the way). It just felt like a shadow of the much bigger, better story that we didn't actually get to see...",
            "Lando Louis L'Amour a well tested formula good cowboys bad cowboys, gold, a wild shootout a fist fight here and there and a pretty woman. Pure escapism in the wild west days happy days abound, my western fix is abated my heart is cheered.",
            "Another winner. Lando travels to Mexico encountering adventure. Is his father still alive? Is there a treasure? Can he trust the tinker? I liked the flow of this story and the journey towards a horse race with a mule and if the Tinkers boxing lessons were worth it. ",
            "Lando is even better the second time!Having read all of the Sackett Series Books several years ago, I decided to read them again. Lando is very much like old Barnabas Sackett, in the description of his body build and his forgiving disposition. In fact, these are two of my favorite characters in the series. When beginning a new book in the series, if these same characters are not mentioned, I miss them as if a long, lost friend has left me forever.If you have not read any of the Sackett books or watched the t.v. series, Barnabas is basically the beginning of the line. I say this because he was an only child living in the Fins in England prior to boarding a ship to come to, what is now, the United States of America. His father taught him to wrestle, fist fight and how to use a sword. Barnabas passed these skills along to his own sons and they have continued the traditional teachings.This series is not just for the guys! It is an awesome story of a family line who sets their roots in the new world and how they manage to live off the land and to survive during brutal times. It is a story of love of the land, freedom and then the great love a person has for their spouse. You will want to read and read again over and over this great series of books. Louis L'Amour has written a tremendous number of books about the land, the people and the sheer determination to survive in a world that was uncivilized when they arrived. What an awesome writer of books! He traveled to the places he has written about and it is evident."

            "The Brown Decades (1931) is an historical essay whose aim is to combat causal anti-Victorianism, salvaging certain heroic episodes of 19th Century Americana. The genealogies that Mumford constructs, though rife with historical inaccuracies, are useful because of their broad inclusiveness. Mumford's writings influenced those Europeans and Americans, including Sigfried Giedion and Henry Russell-Hitchcock, who built the historical foundations of architectural theory and criticism in this country. The later (and rather stale) recensions of these narratives lack Mumford's broad intellectual base and punchy volubility, but are equally important as examples of the historicist thinking that grounded 20th Century art making. More to come when I finish the book.",
            "Prior to reading this book I knew many of the architects, writers, painters, and thinkers of The Brown Decades, but only as individuals. Mumford weaves them all together, giving me a new appreciation for the rich context in which they worked. "

            "Through the first fifty pages of this book I wondered why it's called an art book or an art history book because its scope is so broad. It's more of a social history, a wonderfully insightful study of America during the decades that followed the Civil War which covers the growth in technology, our burgeoning cities, architecture, landscape design, writing, engineering and painting. Mumford shows us how these years laid the foundation from which our modern world developed. This is a remarkable work, a reference for the major figures of the era, including many lesser known names to investigate further. You could spend the entire remainder of your life researching the important figures mentioned in the book. Lewis Mumford, in my opinion, was a genius. I recommend this book to everyone.8/18/08",
            "My introduction to Lewis Mumford and his writing occurred during my undergraduate days when I developed a lifelong love for architecture and painting. I added a major in Art History and found myself absorbed by Modernist painters and the architects of the Brown Decades in America, which stretch roughly between 1875 and 1915.Architects like H. H. Richardson, Louis Sullivan, and the firms of Burnham &amp, Root and McKim, Mead, &amp, White gave Chicago, New York, Philadelphia, St. Louis, and my hometown of Pittsburgh a distinctively solid architectural legacy dressed in rusticated stone -- granite, limestone, and sandstone -- and these materials, artfully used in the new concept of the tall building (both office block and skyscraper), created lasting monuments reminiscent of the Italian Renaissance.The Buried Renaissance was Mumford's working title for The Brown Decades, and he elaborates the reasons why in a prose that is as clear as it is poetic. Mumford encapsulates the lives of architects and the movements in art as gracefully as a trout stream flows. His criticisms -- and there are many of note -- are timeless and universal. Change the formal names and the same criticism of society's fundamental skeleton can be stated today regarding the present state and condition of The Arts and the relationship of these to the wider culture.Highly Recommended . . .",
            "Lewis Mumford is great but this one didn't live up to my high expectations. Oh well. ",
            "There was some interesting information here. The last chapter gave a quick run down of the time period's greatest artists and architects. There was good stuff on Roebling and on the use of light in buildings. Sadly, I am guessing that most of these structures are gone by now. I wonder why there wasn't anything on Frank Furness. I like his buildings in PHiladelphia. ",

            "It is impossible to even begin summing up Anna Tambour's novel 'Crandolin' without sounding a bit crazed. And that's not a bad thing at all. There's something insane about this whole enterprise, but it is an inspired insanity, internally coherent and completely mesmerising.See, there's this fellow, Nick Kippax. He's looking for piquant flavours. He's been through wine snobbery and the all the usual forbidden fruits of the gourmet. But he's after the grail now, the most legendary and elusive dishes of all time, among them the fabled crandolin. In a musty old tome, he finds a stain on the page that contains the recipe for this dish. He tastes it - and is hurtled into a multiple existence as a red blotch on a variety of entities across time and space. These include an itinerant musician's bladder-pipe, the face of a Soviet railway cook, a nest belonging to a family of cinnamologus birds and a jar of very rare honey.Are you with me so far? Good work, you're probably ready to read the book itself, then, and need no further prompting from me.If a completely bonkers conceit isn't enough, Tambour's novel is peopled with a delightful array of, well, people. There's the hapless Kippax himself, Galina, the railway cook, a matronly woman who is blind to her own manifest charms, the many railway employees who yearn for her, a group of railway-enthusiast tourists including a phlegmatic retired Indian railway man and his recumbent wife, there are wandering princes seeking adventure, wannabe brigands, a honey merchant, a master sweetmaker, a virgin in a tower, the Omniscient narrator, the eternal Muse and more. Enough characters to populate a medium-sized and very weird province, maybe even a smallish peninsula.There are even people who aren't people: a donkey whose affections are not to be trifled with, and the crandolin him/herself.Oh, themes? You want themes? How about the nature of love, the source of inspiration and the quandary of authorship? The diversity of food, the inner glory of donkeys and the elusiveness of truth. This book has enough themes for a bumper-sized Cliff's Notes and then some to spare.Most of all, this book is completely original. And how many times do you find a book like that? I read a few hundred of the blasted things a year, and even I only encounter one or two really, really unique books on a good year. If I don't read another book as original, whimsical, witty and wondrous as this all year, it will still have been a very good year. Heck, a very good decade.",
            "Kiss the beast you cannot eat.One of the most joyous and inspired books I've ever read. Its plot is difficult to summarise, but that's a big part of what makes this mischevious book so great. The various stories are both unconnected from each other and yet racing to some sort of focal point, egged on by the titular creature that acts as both MacGuffin and demi-urge puppet-mastering the chaos. To say that Tambour 'commands' the language wouldn't be wholly accurate - she is entirely assured but equally playful, so that while you never doubt that the crazy story is in safe hands, you're surprised by every twist, play on words or irreverent, exquisitely constructed image that comes your way. Comparisons are odious but let's make a couple anyway:1) Palimpsest by Catherynne Valente: cast of characters crowding around a hedonistic pursuit. Equally baroque, but funnier. 2) The Master and Margarita by Mikhail Bulgakov: has none of the Russian master's political subtext/text-text, but an equally mad, seemingly improvised (by virtue of its energetic plenty) forward motion. What could be better than a fun book that has no qualms about being clever? And a clever book that, when all is said and done, is just happy to be a fun one? Crandolin is all this and more, and deserves all the readers in the world.",
            "Every word and conjuration in this stunning novel caresses your pleased with linguistic delights. This is a major work by a sadly overlooked master of lyric narration and limitless imagination. You will not want the awe on these pages to end!",
            "There's a saying about daring and winning that applies here, I think. Just an absolute stunner, the likes of Gravity's Rainbow and the like, but with a prose style more akin to a Brit. The whimsical and farcical nature of the story, the playfulness of the characters and their exchanges, the labyrinth of story set in a wild world of fantasy and magic and equally mundane as our own. It was as queer and quirky as Mervyn Peake and as comical as Bulgakov. I just could not stop reading it. This hasn't gotten enough attention since publication and deserves better. Buy one. If you don't like it, get ahold of me and I'll reimburse you. Promise.",
            "More fantastical craziness, loved it",
            "As I said in one of my updates, this book defies summary. I was glad to see that the revelation I had around page 75 was both half wrong and half right. All right. This story fractures at the very start and slowly some of the pieces pull back together, until the story is as whole as it can be. The plots are very disjointed and episodic at first, but elongate as they merge together. Think of a single person, split into many independent, but captive pieces and spread out across time periods and places, connecting them simply by being part of them, and then, like a draw string, pulling them back together, some pieces connecting, others not, but all still part of the whole. That is this book. That is my best attempt at a summary beyond list each story line and character contained within the text.The story is well-written and I did enjoy reading it, but I'm not sure I'd recommend it to anyone unless I knew for certain that their tastes ran toward weird."

            "Even after 400+ pages with Tony Bramwell I don't know an awful lot about the man. What I do now know a lot more about is the Beatles. Tony Bramwell presents a fascinating and detailed history of the Beatles, from childhood to the present. He was the one constant though all the chaos, the drugs, the adulation, and the fall-outs.He charts the rise of the band, from taking the bus with George to the first Liverpool gig through to global domination. Up to the point that Yoko Ono came on the scene I thought Tony had been even handed in his commentary. Clearly he has a deep dislike of Yoko, and took great delight mocking and putting the boot in. Yoko is not a popular character amongst Beatles fans. She is seen as a major factor in their split, but I find it hard to believe she is rotten to the core as portrayed here. He sees Yoko as an opportunist looking to exploit John Lennon and the Beatles, but maybe the same accusation be levelled at him?The death of Brian Epstein and the eventual split of the band are well handled. Tony then talks about his post Beatles career. This was the first point he really talked about himself, but by the end I'm still not sure if he was a man who contributed to the Beatles being the entity they became, or just a lucky bloke who happened to be in the right place at the right time, who blagged a free ride on the greatest of adventures.",

            "Well, I do love a Beatles book... but this one was disappointing. For someone who was part of the inner circle, he had little to say beyond cliches and old anecdotes that felt clumsy and showbizzy.I was never sure how much I believed his stories either. There were definitely some issues with Yoko which may have clouded his memory. A few of the passages about other women come across as pretty misogynistic and make for uncomfortable reading.A shame because it could have been amazing, given the life that he led. There's no sense of the inner life of the writer, he's a shadow moving through the story.",

            " This is an excellent, interesting book about the author's friendships with the Beatles and with various other celebrities through the years. As billed, it is written from the author's experiences and is not intended to be a history of the Beatles. There are plenty of those available. This offers a different slant on the individual Beatles. As for the author's dislike and distrust of Yoko Ono, it comes across as sincere. Imagine a group of your best friends being split apart by a newcomer. That is what happened to Tony Bramwell and his friends when Yoko entered the picture. His commentary is heartfelt and rings true. Again, other books are available to offer other views of that situation. I thoroughly enjoyed this book and recommend it to anyone interested in learning about how the Beatles were as people through the years.",
            "The absolute best insider story of The Beatles I've read so far. Tony seems to have been pretty decent friends with all four of the guys and there are only a few moments in which he exhibits a very understandable bitterness toward any of them (mostly toward John). The rest of the book is really pretty well thought-out for an individual who is in no way an experienced historian. I highly recommend this one if you're not the type to enjoy dry history but would rather much prefer an exciting narrative to grab onto. Very meaty, lots of good details here!"

The drawings also look similar to illustrations of vehicles in Tamiya instructions. However, the drawings are very well-made. This is a reference mainly on how existing vehicles are drawn in line art form. I am disappointed though that certain favorite vehicles, like the P-47 Thunderbolt and the M-60 tank, were left out.

When he gets hired by a Beverly Hills rich boy arrested for assault, Mickey sees a franchise case: a long, expensive trial with maximum billable hours-until it puts him face-to-face with pure evil and with a man who may truly be innocent. For a lawyer who has always gone for the easy score, getting justice means risking everything. ,The Brass Verdict,When a former colleague is murdered, Mickey inherits his biggest case yet: defending a Hollywood producer accused of killing his wife and her lover. Haller scrambles to prepare for trial, and learns that the killer may be coming for him next. Enter LAPD Detective Harry Bosch, who will do whatever it takes to crack the case, including using Mickey as bait.

Michael Connelly always throws a lot of twists in a long the way as well which make them even more interesting. I am starting the next book, The Fifth Witness and it already has me hooked.Another thing I really like about the books are the Michael Connelly really does his research. The places he lists in Mickey Haller's travels, are pretty much real. It's a nice touch to know exactly where Mick is traveling in the book.Overall just outstanding books.

            "Hellevi Salminen's work hello, i love you cover does not wake up big feelings and annoyingly text to leave a cold, as it stoods and punctures here, and the language of the language would have been the need for writing errors and a little special vocabulary. And I did not experience the description bold as the back cover promises. Its butter to sign that the work tells you about a topical topic because love is always. Just the same to whom will fall in love. The back cover will try to develop a triangle between the three core character of the work, but it is beginning to make it clear that this is more girl-like-son-but-boy-non-girl-but-second-boy pattern. I was thinking about the hands of Daniel. I thought it's revealing the skin. I remembered how rough its curly hair was. And then I thought about how to go to the EMMI. I thought that if everything is different. I was somehow anxious feeling. - Was any fault in me when the kaat and beautiful and fascinating Emmi did not light me - on the contrary. (p. 75) The main character of the work is a high-grade Luke. His childhood friend, a neighboring bay Emmi has been grabbed as a woman, increased the breasts and boring out of the son of the sons of the son of which the Luke was always kept. Emmi does not understand why the Luke sudden is suddenly so cold for him. The bone and even the parents have both divorced and the mother of the bone has formed a family family with his father. Luke left to live with his father, but Emmi moved with his mother to a bone in Mummy. Grandmother is a few years ago dead and the cottage garden has come to the wild. In the midsummer, families celebrate the mid-summer in one of the Mumsors and the godfather will be able to bake the sausage in France when the Finnish movement is in its most beautiful. Includes a friend's kiniel Daniel with whom Emmi is trying to flirt, but Daniel is blinded by his eyes and the vacation is ready. The sons of the boys will cool during the autumn, but the favorite bricks again when Daniel calls a bone in Christmas to France. When the father of the bark finally gets confirmation to his doubt that his son is homo, he does not melt the matter very well. - From this sexual orientation, the father said. - It's a terrible fashion today, Dad said. The words sounded almost mobilly - - these pride-stuff and what they are, Dad said. - I am a bit of a bit taken out of things. - - That's what you think is a fashionable to be sexually abnormal? - - Why does Sun need to find out something just ... I'm just a natural thing? (pp. 115-116 and 118) It is great that writers create rainbow figures (although only because it is fashionable), but I think it would be nice to read something in me, in addition to the faulty stories, a well-written book whose main character is strong and proud to represent a sexual and gender minority. Lovely Simon (Me, Simon, Homo Sapiens) is the only one that comes to mind, and also the Simon neighborhood takes the closet to completely without friction. Hardly all rainbowy young people pain with their sexuality or gender, so they do not necessarily provide the surface of these books and may even damage the attitude towards themselves, wasting unnecessary questioning.",
            "I don't really warmed up for this.As others have said, the subject did not feel courageous.The dialogue was clumsy and the tongue in some places too concise (with them, it pulled me).The attitude of characters in homouteteen did not feel like this day, even if both the father and the guy were just about the Internet, taking clear things.I may still take my tips because this is nice thin."

            "Actual rating: 4.5\ud83c\udf1fBriar Rose is a sexy, dark retelling of Sleeping Beauty with an antebellum twist. Brimming with metallic beasts, monstrous tyrants, fairy-like creatures and a magical curse, Briar Rose takes everything you think you know about the classic tale before tuning it on its head. Okay, Briar Rose isn\u2019t exactly award winning literature. The characters lack depth, the dialogue is iffy but, for what it\u2019s worth, Briar Rose is an engaging adventure and the perfect guilty pleasure sure to cure any slump.Set in a fictional, but conservative town in the Deep South, Briar Rose tells the story of Briar, a teenaged girl living underneath a family curse. Doomed to fall asleep on her sixteenth birthday, Briar finds herself trapped in a fractured fairy tale \u2013 weaved from her very own vivid imagination. With the help of a mysterious stable hand who has an agenda of his own Briar must fight her way out of the story. But the curse has a power of its own and getting home is easier said than done. It\u2019s going to take some witchy magic, a fool\u2019s bargain and a desperate quest \u2013 and that\u2019s if she doesn\u2019t lose her head first\u2026What I love the most about Jana Oliver\u2019s retelling is its Gone with the Wind vibe and steampunk twist. Jana explores the Deep South\u2019s conservative culture with both the Civil War and the history of old root magic. And while we only spend a little time in the fictional town of Bliss, Jana evokes the sense of a sleepy little town dripping with Southern charm.But like I said, we only spend a little time in Bliss. Before we\u2019ve found our footing we\u2019re swept up in the curse and into the world of Sleeping Beauty. Although this tale is closer to that of the Brothers Grimm than the whimsy of Walt Disney\u2019s, complete with an evil regent.I\u2019m not going to lie to you, its Jana\u2019s world building and the incredible concept of her plot that really steals the limelight. The medieval fantasy world is fully-fleshed and it practically envelopes you in its gothic spell \u2013 you can actually smell the reek of unwashed bodies and feel the cobblestoned pavement underfoot.The plot itself is also rather involved. I mean, there\u2019s a lot going on okay? There\u2019s the family feud and the mystery surrounding the whole curse. The characters learn the price of practicing Hoodoo, a dangerous bargain is struck \u2013 and that\u2019s all before we even find ourselves trapped in the curse. Once we are the plot only thickens. New characters are introduced and familiar characters turn up in unexpected places as Briar works to break the curse, free the princess Aurora and liberate the townsfolk. Like I said \u2013 it\u2019s involved.But that\u2019s what makes Briar Rose so much fun. It\u2019s a sweeping adventure of epic proportions.My one complaint is the fact that I found the characters to be pretty one dimensional. And while it didn\u2019t stop me from fully enjoying Jana\u2019s gritty, complex world, I just feel that Briar Rose could have been a real contender in mainstream fantasy if the characters, and the dialogue, took itself a little more seriously.And I couldn\u2019t help but feel that the romance lacked the proper amount of tension and conflict. All I\u2019m going to say is that the chips fell into place a little too easily for my liking. But, what are you gonna do? I was still here for it.Also, a quick shout out to Ruric, the rugged, heroic \u201cstable hand\u201d who unapologetically stole my heart. Honestly, I could have read an entire book about Ruric. Someone make this happen.Anyway, even if the characters felt some-what shallow, there\u2019s just something about Briar Rose that keeps you completely invested. Like good trashy TV, Briar Rose has just the right amount of action and intrigue to keep those pages turning. It\u2019s dark, it\u2019s sexy and I could just live in the pages of this fantasy adventure forever. My number one go-to guilty pleasure, Briar Rose might have some mixed reviews but it will always hold a special place in my soul \u2013 the perfect book to binge during self isolation.",
            "See more reviews at YA Midnight ReadsMini Review:Thank you Pan Macmillan Australia for sending me this copy. No compensation was given or taken to alter this review.After all the praises I heard from The Demon Trappers, I was truly convinced that Briar Rose would be an outstanding read. However, that was not the case.Briar Rose has been obsessed with fairy tales from a young age--however she does not live in one. With her parents following her every move, and not letting her go anywhere near the boy she once played with all the time. But it's worse as her ex-boyfriend has been spreading fake rumours around and nearly everyone believes them. Then on the night before her sixteenth birthday, Briar learns why her parents have been so over-protective. A curse has been put on her and she is to die on her sixteenth birthday. Yet, the next day Briar wakes up, only not in bed. She wakes up in a fairy-tale like setting. More specifically, on like Sleeping Beauty's.I liked the idea of what Jana Oliver was trying to spread. Reality over imagination, even if reality seems harsh at times. We have the main character, Briar trying to accept that imagination/the fake world is not real and will never be as great as reality in the long run. However what killed my enjoyment was the characters. The entire cast was bland and they all seemed far too similar or non-outstanding from one and another. It doesn't really help in this case that it's written in third person as it just weakened my connection with Briar. Briar was actually bearable, I liked her strong headed-ness to save someone she had merely met but that just opened a logic hole of, why the hell would you want to save someone you barely know? Especially when you have an opening to get out of the curse and to the real world. I get that the author is attempting to promote a selfless character yet other plot holes (that I shall not divulge) are not really convincing either.Not really convincing story or likeable characters is an immediate no-no for me. I guess I went in with high expectations yet I still cannot shake the thought that I expected more from such a highly-praised author.",
            " (Edit: 8-18-16) Pros:\u2022The story idea retelling was good, in my opinion at least. I liked how different this was. There was a steampunk theme to this but, there was also another style that I can't quite put my finger on. There was magic, romance, running, and fighting. I couldn't really see any morals in here but, it was an interesting ride. I enjoyed this author's imagination.\u2022The characters were okay however, if I had to say, I liked the story's world more. I did like how I could tell each character a little apart so I didn't get confused when it switched POVs.\u2022I liked the page amount since there didn't seem to be too much of an overload of detail and everything did play out. Cons: \u2022The retelling was a lot more interesting than I had first thought. The story is said to be dark and sexy, as stated in the blurb but, it was more dark than sexy by far. That doesn't mean it was bad but, don't go into this thinking it has too much romance.\u2022The characters were okay, as stated previously but, the main character, Briar, said omigosh too many times and I almost cringed.\u2022 I wish she and the fairy tale prince had ended up together since they had more of an adventure together but, I suppose her and Josh are more realistic, book wise.  Though  if Briar  had  ended up with the prince from her curse, there could be a tie that could lead to a second book.\u2022I already said the characters were okay but, the parents reaction to everything were pretty unrealistic, even for a book about a destiny of doom. I mean, you know your child might die and  yet,  you didn't do anything rational.A good light read. 3/5 stars.",
            "Wow, there goes my fantastic run for books at the start of 2014. I was struggling from the beginning, because I felt that the characters were entirely detached from the situation, at least emotionally. Oh, there's a random curse floating about, determined to fell Briar? Why is it all the characters ask if it's real, and when another character confirms it, suddenly it's a know thing? Just because someone tells you something crazy you generally don't instantly believe them. The writing annoyed me from the start. It seems so stilted and childish. Here's an example, It's not like that, Briar replied. Though it really was. Why is that full stop there? Why?I really tried with this. I was 100 pages from the end when I realized I genuinely did not care how it ended. Not a single character interested me, not a single storyline was worth following. All the characters reacted predictably to every situation and I just couldn't bring myself to care. Do not recommend, ignore the gorgeous cover and run for the hills. Oh and in defense of my DNF, there are 470 pages in this book, I gave it a fair go!",
            "This took a little while to really get into but it eventually picks up, it is a cheesy Sleeping Beauty retelling but I loved it.",
            "Lots of twists to the tail to keep you interested in every detail. Great book",
            "Ok, still processing what happened. Wow.This was a great read. Thanks for recommendation Tasneem!I recommend to YA fantasy lovers that love to read books based on fairytales."

I loved that they each were able to encourage the other to trust the Lord during their respective trials.I liked the way the author used Darcy as the reason for Maddie and Ty to start spending so much time together, though I think she was portrayed as slightly younger than the 8 years old she was said to be. Definitely not a deal breaker though.The mystery of what happened to split up the Wallace and Colby families continues, and I am intrigued to see what will happen next.",
            "Review: Mirror Image Bride by Barbara McMahon 4 STARS Mirror Image Bride is book 2 in Texas Twins miniseries. Her Surprise Sister by Marta Perry was book 1. I wanted to find out what happens next so bought this second ebook from amazon. I hope I get to read the whole series. Maddie Wallace is staying on the Colby Ranch after finding out she has a twin, her older brother has a twin and her mother is not the mother she knew but in the hospital in a comma. Her father is not answering his phone or emails. Her older brother that she grew up with is working deep undercover work. Her younger brother is in the milatary deployed overseas. Her world that she knew has changed so much. She was even engaged for a short while to her older brothers best friend, who is now engaged to her twin sister. Which is great because it was more friend relationship than love and she broke it off right away. Ty Garland is forman at the Colby Ranch and his life has changed in a major way. All of a sudden he is the father of a 8 year old daughter named Darcy that he did not know he had till his ex-wife was killed in a accident. He needed to find a nanny fast so he can work on the ranch now that his boss is in a comma and the son is feeling guilty over his mother's comma. So Maddie became the nanny so she could get to know her new sister and older brother and visit her mom. At least till schools starts again. Thier are still so many questions about how they were all spilt up and why they got name change at least thier mom,her twin and the older brother that she never knew about. Maddie is falling in love with the ranch life, Darcy and even her father. This was a enjoyable book in the series. Thier is not any sex scenes or swear words in the book. I look forward to reading the other books in the texas twins miniseries. I also want to read more books from Barbara McMahon in the future. Publisher: Love Inspired (July 24, 2012) 224pages ",
            "Mirror Image Bride by Barbara McMahonTexas Twins Series Book 2Maddie Wallace has been living at the Colby Ranch since meeting her twin sister, Violet Colby, a few short weeks earlier. She may be a city girl but she\u2019s quickly learning to love the peace, quiet and even the smells of the country here in Grasslands, Texas. Her new challenge is to be the best nanny for young Darcy that she can be. Or is the challenge to get to know the handsome father, Ty Garland?Ty has been working for the Colby\u2019s for eight years now. He once had dreams of owning his own spread but they died along with his marriage to Brittany. When out of nowhere he finds that his ex-wife is dead and she left a daughter behind, his daughter, life changes in the blink of an eye. When Violet offers her sister to watch Darcy all he can see is Brittany all over. Someone wearing dress pants and open toed shoes on a ranch. Not someone who would be staying around long. First impressions can be very misleading though as Ty finds out.We get to revisit with Violet and Landon from Her Surprise Sister and get small glimpses of Jack Colby who we learn more about in book 3: Carbon Copy Cowboy. Belle Colby is still in a coma and Brian Wallace is still MIA on a mission trip. An exciting series so far with four more books to follow. I always enjoy these Love Inspired multi-author series and it\u2019s very impressive how six different authors can come together and each of their individual books connect into one great story.http://justjudysjumbles.blogspot.com/...

A rape in Palm Beach. , All they have in common is the presence of one of America's most beloved and influential families. But nobody is asking questions. Not the police. Not the prosecutors. And certainly not George Becket, a young lawyer toiling away in the basement of the Cape & Islands district attorney's office. George has always lived at the edge of power. He wasn't born to privilege, but he understands how it works and has benefitted from it in ways he doesn't like to admit. Now, an investigation brings him deep inside the world of the truly wealthy--and shows him what a perilous place it is. , Years have passed since a young woman was found brutally slain at an exclusive Cape Cod golf club, and no one has ever been charged. Cornered by the victim's father, George can't explain why certain leads were never explored--leads that point in the direction of a single family--and he agrees to look into it. , What begins as a search through the highly stratified layers of Cape Cod society, soon has George racing from Idaho to Hawaii, Costa Rica to France to New York City. But everywhere he goes he discovers people like himself: people with more secrets than answers, people haunted by a decision years past to trade silence for protection from life's sharp edges. George finds his friends are not necessarily still friends and a spouse can be unfaithful in more ways than one. And despite threats at every turn, he is driven to reconstruct the victim's last hours while searching not only for a killer but for his own redemption. ,Advance praise for \"Crime of Privilege\" ,\"Fans of John Grisham and Scott Turow especially will love this engrossing story of murder involving high society.

            " This could not have come at a better time. I have had 2 weeks of coworker bad behavior, over 3 feet of snow, and trying to read some really bad books that I wil not take up my time to review, this showed up at my post office box. ( I received this from Random house in Goodreads Giveaway)I poked at it several times like a cat attacking a fake felt mouse, hoping it was the real thing, before jumping on it ferociously, going for the jugular. This is my first W. Walker book, it will not be my last. . Cape Cod and Palm Beach, what do they have in common besides places I will never be unvited? Lots of money, mayhem, and murder, homes of the rich and famous, and plenty of secrets people will pay lots of money to make disappear. George, our narrator is on the fringes of the rich and untouchables! Only because he is roommates with a good friend of the iconic Gregory family. With mansions in Florida and on Cape Cod, money to burn, good looking, tanned, college educated children, and relatives in the senate, this family is a national treasure.( Sound familiar?)But George finds himself involved in a pricarious situation when he fails to act on the behalf of a young woman during a heinous attack involving several members of the upper crust. He is questioned, and fails to implicate the Gregory boys. He then is shadowed by this guilt, a relentless agent, and leaves the college he was attending to detach himself from the situation.  Unfortunately the situation won't detach itself from George. It follows him relentlessly, so does the agent, It invades his life and demands closure. First he finds out that the young lady he failed to protect commits suicide. Before her death she had filed a suit against the Gregory's for rape but no one would substantiate her claim, not even George, remember? Then Bill Telford, the father of another young woman found with her head bashed in on the golf course years earlier, not more than a stones throw from the Gregory family compound, blames them for her death as well. Nicknamed Bill Anything NewTelford because he calls the police staion asking  Anything new? again and again, tracks George down, because he wants him to help find his daughters murderer. Ted provided leads that no one seemed to follow and George heads out to track them down. The problem is, that it seems that every time George leaves the safety of his home state to follow a lead,he almost gets killed. His experiences are both terrifying and hysterically funny. Walker has a knack for making you laugh in the middle of a scary situation. Some of these are pretty frightening, but funny as hell just the same. His characterizations are flawless, I absolutely loved the conversations between characters, so true to life.It took along time for me to warm up to George, for the first third of the book I really thought he was a total creep, and wanted to punch him in the face. The second third, every time he was in a bad situation and feeling pain, I thought, he deserved it, sort of, by the last 20 pages I felt he had finally paid for want he had NOT done, he had suffered, but not quite enough. At the end he finally redemed himself, almost. For me it will take another whole book for that."

            "George Becket is a deputy D.A. and sometime chump, trying to solve a murder in a community where one obscenely wealthy family holds all the power. Is it worth risking his job, and maybe even his life, to find justice for the victim's family?This is not only a mystery, but an exploration of the social strata on Cape Cod. The Gregory family displays that sense of entitlement we envy and despise, and their sins are often overlooked or covered up. People like George Becket, who don't come from privileged backgrounds, are expected to know their place and play along. Consequences can be unpleasant for those who follow their consciences and step out of line.I was feeling crabby about this book at first, because I didn't like the first 20-30 pages. But I was determined to give it a chance, and I'm glad I did. It was confusing for awhile trying to keep track of all the peripheral characters. Eventually I got sucked into the game as George chases red herrings all over the globe. He's convinced the Gregorys are covering up a murder, and he's determined to expose them, if only to assuage his guilt over a party rape he witnessed many years ago in Florida. Back then he allowed the Gregory family to buy his silence, just like the people he's now tracking down.I would have liked a little more closure to the story, but it's to the author's credit that he showed some restraint. It's more realistic not to have the villains spill everything at the end, and a powerful family is even less likely to tell anyone exactly how everything went down. The names and pertinent details in this novel have been changed to protect the filthy rich and famous. The author's too smart to imply that this fictional family was modeled after those Irish Catholics from Massachusetts with a penchant for politics. So it's not about that family. Really, it's not. It's fiction. But the parallels are too obvious to disregard. A giant compound on Cape Cod. A winter home in Florida. Crimes that go unpunished thanks to money and political clout. And especially the reference to the Senator and his kids and his sisters' kids and his late brothers' kids. Despite all the parallels, though, I thought the Gregorys' diabolical behavior was a lot more like the Bushes than it was like any Democrats you might be thinking of.Rating = 3.5 starsPerfect for a lazy day by the pool or a long plane ride. Thank you, Ballantine Books, for sending me a review copy. ",
            "Having lived in Massachusetts for just over two and a half years, it always adds another element to reading when you can envision some of the places mentioned in a novel, and you\u2019re at least familiar with the name-drops of some of the other locations. The connection is immediate, and rather fulfilling, and if that was all CRIME OF PRIVILEGE had to offer, it would have given me one layer of enjoyment. But this particular novel offers readers so much more. Cape Cod, and the Massachusetts backdrop that sits at the heart of this novel, offers a great locale for the ongoing debate of old money versus new money, and the ways in which the rich manipulate the legal system to their advantage. It\u2019s an interesting argument, and one well-worth the merit of an entire novel. Great writing certainly doesn\u2019t hurt either.The characters offer the reader more than just mere caricatures and stereotypes, and the story flows across time and locations with effervescent ease. George Becket is a man with a tainted soul, along with a tainted past, and he\u2019s a character worth getting to know. His motivations may not have always been one hundred percent clear, but I was willing to forgive this minor transgression of the author for the sake of a rather engaging read. From the first page to the last, my attention was cemented within the confines of this novel.The chapters came in short, staccato bursts, and I found myself flipping pages faster than a speeding train. The settings were rich, and traipsed through a variety of locales, like you would expect from any international thriller. My biggest complaint was that the novel had to end. If you\u2019re looking for an entertaining legal thriller, then you might want to keep CRIME OF PRIVILEGE in mind.I received this book for free at Bouchercon.",
            "The premise of this novel sounded interesting--a mix of a murder mystery and an influential family involved--and was happy to have been approved of a galley copy to read.While the premise of this novel was intriguing, the overall story fell flat and boring for me. This was mostly because of the narrator and protagonist of the story. I found George to be far too\u2026blank, passive and lacking in some sort of strong or particular characterisation to define him that would in turn compel me, the reader, like him and root for him as he investigates further. The writing and narration also felt awkward at times that I never really connected with the story. I only read it to the very end to see whether the truth would surface and the perpetrators brought to justice.Fans of the mystery genre may enjoy this novel but I was left feeling indifferent about it. My complete review of the novel was originally posted at eclectictales.com: http://www.eclectictales.com/blog/201...",
            "George Becket is a young man from a blue-collar family. While in college, one of his friends receives an invitation to a party being held at the Palm Beach summer home of Senator Gregory of Cape Cod. George feels decidedly out of place and latches on to a drunk young woman named Kendrick Powell. When the son and nephew of Senator Gregory offer Kendrick a tour of the home, George tags along. Unfortunately, the two young men had something other than showing off the house in mind. While in the library, they molest Kendrick, and George witnesses what they are doing. He stops them when they begin to use a candlestick holder to enter Kendrick, but he isn\u2019t sure that they have actually raped her. In fact, he presumes that she is a willing participant, since she is the one who decided to drink too much and had the ability to drive herself home. Later, Kendrick claims that she has been raped, and George fails to testify on her behalf. In a quid pro quo, the Gregory family paves the way for him to get a job as a prosecuting attorney. Several years later, George is approached by the father of a young woman who was found brutally slain at an exclusive Cape Cod golf club. Bill Telford has been dogging everyone in the office about the death of his daughter, Heidi, nine years earlier. He has been there so frequently that the staff refer to him as \u201cAnything New\u201d. In fact, he has some provided some important information about the murder, but no one ever does anything about it. The leads that he has given have never been shared or placed in the police file. Perhaps out of guilt about his non-participation in the Kendrick case, George decides to take a look at the situation. It\u2019s no surprise to learn that the Gregory family may once again be involved. It\u2019s difficult to find anything concrete that will result in the perpetrator being found and punished, especially since several other people have benefitted from Senator Gregory\u2019s largesse, and no one wants to kill the golden goose.George has learned the political game. When he threatens to reveal that the district attorney\u2019s office has failed to investigate the Telford case in order to protect the Gregory family, they move him to a larger office and provide funds for him to undertake an investigation. Rather implausibly, he travels to Hawaii, California, Costa Rica, New York and France while following the clues. Essentially, this is a cold case so all of that effort seemed excessive. CRIME OF PRIVILEGE is both a legal thriller, a study of the privileges of class and a book of redemption. The protagonist isn\u2019t exactly admirable, particularly as a young man, but his work on the Telford case shows a lot of dedication and some courage. Although I couldn\u2019t quite believe everything that happened in the book, Walker did a good job of showing the influence of power and how it corrupts."

            "Flappers and Philosophers are the tales of youth, mostly\u2026 Stories of young dreamers and their beautiful dreams being broken. And I admired how excellently the spirit of that rather rebellious epoch was preserved in the tales. Ardita scrutinized him carefully \u2014 and classed him immediately as a romantic figure. He gave the effect of towering self-confidence erected on a slight foundation \u2014 just under the surface of each of his decisions she discerned a hesitancy that was in decided contrast to the arrogant curl of his lips.Being a supreme egotist Ardita frequently thought about herself, never having had her egotism disputed she did it entirely naturally and with no detraction from her unquestioned charm. Though she was nineteen she gave the effect of a high-spirited precocious child, and in the present glow of her youth and beauty all the men and women she had known were but driftwood on the ripples of her temperament. She had met other egotists \u2014 in fact she found that selfish people bored her rather less than unselfish people \u2014 but as yet there had not been one she had not eventually defeated and brought to her feet.The language is elaborately metaphoric and light irony prevails while the plots are always intriguing and original.In its mood The Cut-Glass Bowl differs from the other stories \u2013 it a kind of a sarcastically dark allegory of fate\u2026\u2026the night I told him I was going to marry Harold, seven years ago in ninety-two, he drew himself way up and said: \u2018Evylyn, I\u2019m going to give a present that\u2019s as hard as you are and as beautiful and as empty and as easy to see through.\u2019 He frightened me a little \u2014 his eyes were so black. I thought he was going to deed me a haunted house or something that would explode when you opened it. That bowl came, and of course it\u2019s beautiful.And this splendid bowl has unexpectedly turned into the instrument of doom\u2026\u201cAt eighteen our convictions are hills from which we look, at forty-five they are caves in which we hide.\u201d Our expectations for the future are always greater than our disappointments of the past.",
            "This was a lot of fun. Exceedingly. Awfully Fun. The sort of telling that I feel I had been not wasting time. And, extra to it, I am certainly much obliged to Daniel Coenn (whose name I\u2019ve heard not until couple of weeks ago and for sure I'll easily forget, knowing and trusting my memory), as by fortunate accident I\u2019ve found a little e-book named Francis Scott Fitzgerald: His Words, while I was in a random search for a new entry to start reading (although I have plenty of books in my own library that I have not yet read...). So, my attention was gripped firmly while reading quite a bunch of the most famous quotes that populated this American writer works. I\u2019ve always liked F. Scott F. and have read most of his novels and will most probably come back to them over time. So, reading some quotes from this e-book, I felt like refreshing my acquaintance with F. Scott F. and easily available \u2013 of course I look up first on free of charge offers \u2013 was this really very entertaining collection of short stories dated back 1920. Well, how about that? 100 years gone since its publication and my time of read. As we like to say, it is never too late. Fortunately!\u226a In the millennium an educational genius will write a book to be given to every young man on the date of his disillusion. This work will have the flavor of Montaigne's essays and Samuel Butler's note-books\u2014and a little of Tolstoi and Marcus Aurelius. It will be neither cheerful nor pleasant but will contain numerous passages of striking humor. Since first-class minds never believe anything very strongly until they've experienced it, its value will be purely relative . . . all people over thirty will refer to it as depressing. This prelude belongs to the story of a young man who lived, as you and I do, before the book. \u226bThis little extraction is the start-up quote from the 7th short story,\u2019Dalyrimple goes wrong\u2019, who is a character torn between self and society. I found it very valuable, through its most obvious irony: does Dalyrimple \u201cgo wrong\u201d when he chooses to become a masked burglar to make ends meet (though he wanted to work honestly)- or when he is, by a stroke of fate, rewarded at the end because he has learned to \u201ccut corners\u2019 and land on \u201cthe right side of the fence\u201d? \ud83d\ude0aSliding swiftly and with style, or better said serpentlike intensity through these eight short stories, I wholeheartedly may say that I\u2019m mighty glad of now having read them and, if I can give a verdict, these stories are to get you going good \ud83d\ude09 Being an impressionistic nature, I was definitely attracted by both words from the title: flappers and philosophers, and I have had a little bit of time dedicated to google-ing to read more about these \u201cflappers\u201d thing. It\u2019s always good to put together as many pieces of the puzzle (I sincerely confess I was somehow ignorant of the history of \u201cflappers\u201d), especially when this word is assigned to stories written by the famous Jazz age iconic writer.I have been awfully overjoyed by the story \u2018Bernice bobs her hair\u2019, this could justify why I have posted so many quotes from this story, almost an entire chapter at some point. I have very personal reasons, of course. I felt myself part of the story \u2013 both as a character but also symbolically, I mean even before getting to this collection of stories I have taken the decision to \u2018bob my hair\u2019.It was great to see what were the so-called social standards for a generation of young Americans, what were in their mind the secrets of popularity, what were you supposed to say at a dinner table or on the dance floor, overall how a girl should make herself more socially appealing. As we well know this involves a lot of advice on conversation, poise, carriage, dancing, expression, dress, and personality, etc etc. I wasn\u2019t myself in a similar situation (or perhaps I was, yes-yes I was some good years back, if I take into account three weddings that I was invited to attend and where some high personages wanted to make me \u2018look\u2019 more socially appealing, haha), but I did make a pledge to \u2018bob my hair\u2019 if I pass successfully the entry exams for university (actually in the those old gone years I had had very long hair, and quite beautiful for that young age, and of course I had proceeded to sacrifice this beloved possession - my tresses \ud83d\ude0a(how silly and funny we\u2019re when we\u2019re young). Nowadays, to \u2018bob my hair\u2019 has less traumatic effects. I guess after a certain age, things to be done not only feel less painful, mentally-wise, but also you realize that you like yourself no matter the length of the hair.Curiously enough, I have arrived at the end enthusiastically and smiling and smiling and being rather absurdly happy \ud83d\ude09 That is to count for a gay time I\u2019ve been having, and concluding this is an absolute jewel \u2013 I mean reading was such a little thing, and surprisingly a happy thing. Hope this makes sense!I have tremendously enjoyed all of the stories, and I was very pleased to see that each one had a surprising closing effect, something that I was not prepared for. Well, of course they are not thrillers or crime-based history, but the conclusion is in the opposite direction with the general flow of the story. I guess that is what made me loved the stories even more. Still the general effect is that misty waves have been passing before my eyes, I felt too gay and fickle and cheerfully collapsing backward upon my bed, upon each story closing. \u226a \u201cI want to be a society vampire, you see,\u201d she announced coolly, and went on to inform him that bobbed hair was the necessary prelude. She added that she wanted to ask his advice, because she had heard he was so critical about girls.\u201d",
            "This little book of eight short stories took me about a week to read, and now I\u2019m very sorry that it\u2019s over. All of the stories were very entertaining and vivid. It made me feel like I was a nineteen-year-old girl in the first or second decade of the twentieth century. Many of the stories in this book are focused on girls of that age, and I thought it was quite strange that Fitzgerald could write so well about them. Almost all of the stories can be classified as coming of age stories in the early twentieth century.The book starts off with a strong and rebellious nineteen-year-old girl in \u201cThe Offshore Pirate.\u201d That first story was probably my favorite. My second favorite was probably \u201cBernice Bobs Her Hair,\u201d which was also about a nineteen-year-old who was figuring herself out a lot more than the heroine from the first story, who knew exactly who she was and what she wanted. I also liked \u201cThe Ice Palace\u201d in which a very vivacious teenager named Sally Carroll visits a Northeastern city in the hopes of marrying, and finds out that she misses the colorful southern town where she grew up.The last story in the collection, \u201cThe Four Fists,\u201d features a manly man who gets knocked down by four punches in his lifetime, each of which teaches him an important lesson, and the story takes him from New York to the oil fields of Texas and the ranches of New Mexico. It felt rather refreshing to read a burly story after all the quite feminine ones, but I truly liked them all. The second-to-last story, \u201cDalyrimple Goes Wrong,\u201d also features a male character and his descent into shadiness. What I noticed is how differently Fitzgerald writes about male characters than female characters \u2013 there\u2019s less internal monologue and descriptions of thoughts and conversations, and more action at a swiftly moving pace. One story, \u201cHead and Shoulders\u201d does a beautiful job of explaining a role reversal of sorts, in which the female character shines and the male character withers. To read this book was to be transported back to a totally different time \u2013 anywhere from the 1890\u2019s to the 19-teens, and to totally different places \u2013 usually New England towns, Ivy League educational institutions, and country clubs. I enjoyed the scenes about fox trots and flappers and jazz music and I wished, sometimes, that I could have lived back then. But Fitzgerald had great sympathy for his female characters \u2013 \u201cThe Cut-Glass Bowl\u201d featured a downfall of one of them, and the strong character of Marjorie in \u201cBernice Bobs Her Hair\u201d explains how the young girls can become withered and unloved housewives, many of whom are disapprovingly interspersed into that story. In fact, if I carry one thing away from Flappers and Philosophers other than hours of entertaining reading, it is a remark on the position of young women in the late 1800\u2019s and early 1900\u2019s. Many of the stories feature girls at the cusp of womanhood who wear rose-tinted glasses and think that life is about dances and social events. Yet the men are the ones getting an education, seeing the world and taking part in all of the action (again with the exception of the uniquely witty \u201cHeads and Shoulders\u201d plot). In this sense I am very happy to be living in the 21st century and just reading about these female characters in the early 20th century.",
            "This is not his best writing. I'm guessing Zelda didn't help much. These stories just kept him in the bucks. I'm not shying away from reading his novels because of these short stories. I don't feel like these reflect his talent. ",
            "Flappers and Philosophers: http://readwithstyle.wordpress.com/20...I must admit what drew me to the collection, despite of course the name of Fitzgerald, is the title. I mean, come on, Flappers and Philosophers is simply genial. I doubt anyone in the 1920s would ever use the word philosopher do describe a flapper. Flappers, for those of you who don\u2019t know, were a \u201cnew breed\u201d of young Western women in the 1920s who wore short skirts, bobbed their hair, listened to jazz, and flaunted their disdain for what was then considered acceptable behavior. Flappers were seen as brash for wearing excessive makeup, drinking, treating sex in a casual manner, smoking, driving automobiles, and otherwise flouting social and sexual norms.\u201d First rule of every student \u2013 when possible, always use Wikipedia (even one of the professors in the ever so acclaimed HEC cited Wikipedia in a finance class, so I don\u2019t feel guilty at all). I wouldn\u2019t provide a definition of a philosopher here, except to say that for most people it would be the exact opposite to a flapper. And yet somewhat magically Fitzgerald manages to balance the duality of flapper and the philosopher in his characters. I must say, all of us women are flappers and philosophers, simultaneously. Whatever works for us at that particular moment.The stories in Flappers and Philosophers are of course about the Jazz Age \u2013 the excess, the debauchery and the greed associated with it. Fitzgerald\u2019s characters in this collection foreshadow his more complex characters in the future novels to come \u2013 shallow, self-absorbed, obsessed with beauty, money, and power, greedy, and sometimes extremely cruel. And yet, exactly these flappers produce so profound conclusions about life that the reader has nothing else to do but gasp with astonishment:Read more: http://readwithstyle.wordpress.com/20...",
            "You've been through all of F. Scott Fitzgerald's booksYou're very well readIt's well known-Bob Dylan Ballad of a Thin ManI could tell that Flappers was the work of a young writer. Some of the stories felt a little formulaic and predictable. You could see their bones sticking out. Other times it felt like Mr. Fitzgerald was trying to pop off the page saying, Ooh! Look! I interrupt the flow of this story to remind you that I'm the author! Look how intricate these sentences are! Isn't my dialogue believable? I guess subtlety was not young Mr. Fitzgerald's strong suit: his narrative voice can be at times like a megaphone.THAT having been said, I enjoyed the crap out of these stories. They are all well written fun to read. And there's nothing I like more than a good book of good short stories. Four stars for that. I'm going to read more of this man's work in the near future. Also: this book has a great cover. It would make a really cool tattoo. ",
            "If you have the Penguin Modern Classics The curious case of Benjamin Button and six other stories, I do not recommend getting this one, because half of the stories are the same. I really like Fitzgerald's writing, unfortunately as he's not a Good Person at all. I do recommend it if you like short stories!"

A lesbian trapped in an arid relationship and a life that has brought her success but scant emotional sustenance.Their eyes first meet across the distance of a public park. One glance is all it takes for ignition. A slow-building sexual fire soon becomes a conflagration that engulfs both their lives.But no matter how compelling the attraction, no matter how intensely love may reach into the depths of either of their souls, reality is inflexible. Elena\u2019s husband is pastor of a church; her son is the center of her life; and she is haunted by a burden of grief and guilt that fixes her firmly in the conventional life she leads.From Nicole Conn, novelist and multi-award-winning director of little man, writer-director of the legendary lesbian film Claire of the Moon, comes this powerful love story--a luminously romantic film as evocative as it is erotic (and already famous for its Longest Kiss in Cinema History)\u2014and now a novel that reveals every moment of Elena\u2019s unforgettable journey.",

            "Elena Undone is a beautiful, but realistic, true love story. It is about following your heart, and finding your soul mate. Nicole Conn takes you through the consequences, conflict, confusion, and necessary, but painful, actions that must be taken to follow your heart to your soul mate if you aren't already with that person. As the story begins, the main characters are middle aged and haven't found their soul mates. It adds the dimension of questioning and exploring sexuality, and that your soul mate may come in an unexpected package, another part of the conflict and confusion the characters face. It explores the meaning of commitment between spouses and to a chosen, accidental or imposed life. Do you live your life or do you just go through the motions, ignoring how miserable or numb you are to your own unhappiness?The book is the novelization of the independent film. It fills in a lot of background and explains many characters' origins the movie had to cut for time. Some scenes are different from the movie, but convey the exact same outcomes and meanings. Independent film just doesn't have the budget to do short, but expensive, scenes. It also reveals some of what goes on between one major scene and the next in the movie. There are a few key scenes that you would love to be a fly on the wall to see what happened after the director said cut. It doesn't fill them all in, however. Those gaps can be figured out from what happens next.The movie is not rated. I would rate it NC-17 for adult themes. This love story has a main theme and several complex underlying themes, all of an age 30+ adult nature. ",
            "Perhaps I've just had enough of romance novels and they all start to blur together. I struggled to find any originality in the story but gave up after a while. One selling point of this book is that it's realistic - very true to human relationships and brutally honest about family structures. The truth is the writing drove me crazy. You can only call an Indian woman exotic so many times before I want to scream. Literally every time Peyton is thinking about Elena, the word exotic is used. There are tons of other words you can use, but this just makes it seem like Conn isn't used to writing characters that aren't white. I think Elena's race and family background could have played a MUCH bigger role (besides, you know...letting us know how exotic she is). There are hardly any mentions about her parents and their relationship, except maybe a line or two. They never talk about leaving India for England then moving to New York and settling in L.A. These are things that really impact a person, but Elena? Nope. She could have been an incredible character but she ends up being completely flat. I get it, you want to drive the point home that Elena's marriage is not passionate or filled with love. There is just SO MUCH that goes into creating a person like her - someone who never dared experiment, never questioned what it meant to be in love, never dared to seek passion, someone who becomes so obedient and absorbed in a constricting structure that their very identity becomes their daily chores. But WHERE IS THAT? Where do we see, or even begin to understand, why Elena is the way she is? Also her husband is hardly in here life (which is the point) but he doesn't even FEEL like a character.Honestly the only well developed character is Tori. ",
            "Ok when I read the first few chapters I got extremely bored I didn't understand the author way of writing it was weird and chaotic 'at least to me' and it had soooo many filler pages and conversation that didn't lead anywhere, it didn't contribute to the story in anyway but after almost half of the book the storyline became really interesting it held raw emotions like the agony of betrayal and the joy of falling in love .. The characters were aware of the mistake they were getting into but they were helpless to stop it as their attraction grow even stronger and that is exactly what I love about books it gives you a sneak beak of the way the character think what is in their mind when they do what have done and the intensity of their emotion is shown in a manner that no actor can display .. Over all is a good read",
            "Dont we just love story with happy endings? Even its pretty much the predictable storyline, sacrificing every for true love. Life is tough sometimes, all we need is something that can give us hope, and idealistic dream to dream about.As always the book is better than the movie, with its details and long stretch of dialogues and monologues, it gives the characters more personality, dynamics, all in all more developed. In the part where, Peyton and Elena started having an affair, there was intensity, strong emotions, but it think its too lengthy, giving it a naggy and 'just move on, will you?' kinda feeling. ",
            "Erotic love story about a pastor's wife who falls in love with a woman and carries out an affair while her orderly home life unravels around her. General story was ok but some characters a bit irritating eg the love doctor Tyler I think he was called. The story ended without clearly tying up what happened to the husband."

            "Note: Advanced review copy provided by Netgalley.A rare blend of personal context of his own son's burial on historically tribal land and non-fiction regarding the long ignored burial rights of a local Native American people (the Yurok). This work covers the history of anthropological and historical work, both academic and amateur, and its effect on tribal/government/landowner/academia relationships. Platt's narrow focus on a single, and locally defined, group of people prevents this work from exploding into a dense manuscript. Instead, at roughly 200 pages, this short work refrains from reading like a laundry list of similar incidents and horrors, instead bring into focus and making personal the individual travails of the Yurok. While much of the book recounts the negative, there are brights spots of recent Native American activism, as well as hope for the future and a loose outline of what can and might be done to continue, and preferably speed up, repatriation efforts. An astounding work of sympathy, this ought to be required reading for every American who profited from the slaughter and subjugation of the Native American peoples. That means all of you.",

            "Bloomer, an early advocate of women's rights, and a newspaper publisher hated the way proper ladies were expected to dress in 1850. She hated the way the long skirts picked up mud and trash from the streets. The constricting corsets made it hard to breathe. The hoops were so wide, women had trouble fitting through doors. The layers of petticoats were hot, and the whole outfit put together weighed between 20 and 40 pounds.   Luckily for Amelia, she was introduced to Elizabeth Cady Stanton's cousin, Libby, who, after a visit to Europe where she had seen women wearing baggy pantaloons covered by a short skirt, had adopted the outfit as her own. Amelia was inspired. Not only did she create pants for herself, she wrote about them in her newspaper. Soon many women were wearing bloomers, and enjoying the freedom that light, loose clothing afforded them.  Corey presents an interesting glance at a revealing bit of history. Chelsea McLaren's illustrations are simple, yet evocative. There is also an author's note at the back of the book that provides a more detailed account of Bloomer's life and accomplishments."

            "Again, rating this one based purely on my five-year-old's response. I don't like kid's books, toys, sandboxes, or fun. She likes the book but doesn't sleep with it: thus, the four, not five. Still, the book provoked a good discussion of why I'm not a lady and plan to remain so. Nice bit of history here too -- the ending which fast forwards to modern slacks-wearing broads felt a bit tacked on. Otherwise, solid addition to the library for parents who have noticed that, uh, girls need active role models and a sense of history that includes them. Not just anorexic passive long haired damsels. (Even Elsa -- she needs to consume something other than ice cubes.) Yeah. ",
            "Great introduction to some of the pioneers in women's rights in America. The illustrations are so charming and fun! The story itself is nothing that spectacular (I found it a bit annoying that Amelia Bloomer, who was supposedly elevating women's status, kept thinking that things were silly. Um, couldn't we have found a more grown-up word for her to use?) but I haven't found many books on this subject and it's an important one!!! The historical note at the end is really interesting, too. Let us all be thankful to Amelia Bloomer and her comrades for their tenacity and bravery--I'm certainly glad I don't have to wear whale-bone corsets that rearrange my internal organs, or skirts that weigh 20 pounds!!!",
            "The story is about a women called Amelia Bloomer who tried to fight her society and make changes that she didn\u2019t like in her society. Amelia try to not be a proper lady like many girls in her town who were tiny heavy dresses and can\u2019t work or vote. In fact she think that proper lady is silly, and she want women to have right to do whatever they want. She start to do things against the norms, she start working at her newspaper and designing her convert clothes. At first, she faced resistance from the society. Later on women like her movement and start to wear her clothes design. The story is teaching kids about women's history and the importance of being an individual.

            "Genre: BiographySummary: This book tells the story of Amelia Bloomer and how she fought for women's rights by creating her own newspaper and suggesting that women wear less restrictive clothing. Critique: A. Captivating visual representationsB. This book told the biography of Amelia Bloomer in a beautifully visual manor. The illustrations were rich, colorful, and alluring. The simplistic descriptions of how and why Amelia thought the way she did and how others viewed her were purely brilliant. I feel any student will be able to understand the significance of Amelia Bloomer's accomplishments and the visual representations will stick in readers' minds. C. For example, there is a visual of Amelia carrying a stack of newspapers that she created and also on the page is an illustration of a personal checklist written by her which stated, To do: Women Vote Work. These words and pictures are so simple yet so powerful. Curriculum Connection: This story would be wonderful to use when talking about women's rights. This story could be used to show how women had to fight to defend their opinions and ideals and many things that we view as normal today were against the social norms of previous times. This is a wonderfully written book that will help children to remember the significance of Amelia Bloomer forever. ",
            "This candy-colored dazzler introduces young readers to the legendary historical figure Amelia Bloomer and her influence on everything from women's suffrage to the styles of clothes girls and women wear this very day. Horrified by the highly impractical, nonsensical fashions of the time, Amelia refuses to conform to her era's ideals and embraces the traveling costume she sees on her friend's visiting cousin, Libby Miller. Adapting the European style to be accessible for the average American woman, Amelia bravely campaigns for the freedom her bloomers offer through her suffrage activism and her newspaper reporting. A fizzy spree of beautiful, saturated colors and lovely sketch-like illustration, this book can function in many ways, from a first foray into biographic work to an easily digestible glimpse into women's history. An author's note gives further detail about Amelia's legacy in back. Ages 5-8. She ran and jumped and twirled... and did all the things she had always wanted to do.",
            "Genre: PB13A great story to start teaching kids about women's history and the importance of being an individual. The story by Shana Corey gives the reader a small taste of who Amelia Bloomer is and the role she played in history. Readers get to learn that Amelia was a lady ahead of her time and that her beliefs were very strong. Amelia wanted to make changes in her part of the world for women and found many ways to start making changes happen. The illustrations as well as the writing style heighten the story to a level that is perfect to be read aloud as well as read alone for historical information. This story can be used in many age ranges and would be beneficial to have in every classroom. I love the way the story progresses and shows that by being strong and using your mind you can accomplish anything. this story will give readers a look into the past that will also help them in their future. I will be buying a copy of this book for my own library.Three words to describe this book: Historical, positive, amazing",
            "Amelia Bloomer is a historical fiction account of one of the pioneers for women's rights. Unhappy with the inequalities that women faced, she became editor of a women's news paper where she advocated for women's rights. She also helped change the fashion of the time with the introduction of bloomers. The dresses, corsets and petty coats women wore were very restrictive for woman and dangerous to their health. She was introduced to bloomers by a friend and wrote about them in her newspaper, changing fashion for women.The brightly colored and fun illustrations along with the playful fonts made the retelling of historical events enjoyable and relatable for children to understand. This book is a great platform for opening up conversations about women's rights but also tells a fun story that stands on its own."

            "Too Many Dinosaurs by Mercer Mayer is a story of a boy who wants a puppy but ends up with a baby triceratops and other wild dinosaurs instead. A boy is told he can't have a puppy, so he ends up buying a dinosaur egg at a yard sale, from which hatches a baby triceratops! When the baby runs amok and runs aways, the boy buys a dinosaur horn which summons a bunch of dinos including a giant meat-eater. The boy blows the horn again and the dinosaurs disappear. Mom insists on buying him a puppy, and throws out the horn, which unfortunately is found by the trashmen....The text is in a large font making it easy to read. The story is told in a matter of fact manner.The illustrations really lift this story with lots of details, bright colors and images in Mercer Mayer's signature style. The illustrations emphasize the crazyiness and humor of the situation. My favorite images include Mr. Jerry's yard sale, the triceratops chasing two dogs, the dinosaurs emerging when called, the two wordless double page spreads featuring dinos in the yard, and the fading dinosaurs.This reminds me a bit of Patrick's Dinosaurs but is much funnier. It would probably be a hit as a storytime read-aloud, although one on one reads would allow closer study of the illustration details. I loved Mom's reversal of her decision about a puppy at the end.For ages 3 to 7, dinosaurs, pet-owning, puppies, fantasy, and fans of Mercer Mayer. "

            "Thrusts of Justice by Matt Youngmark plugs deep into childhood nostalgia with this choose-your-own-adventure book written for adults. Set in a unique (and slightly tongue-in-cheek) superhero universe, this book gives a laid-off journalist from Cleveland the chance to step into the role of superhero just in time to save the world from certain doom. The journalist, of course, is \u201cyou.\u201dThe book opens with you and your fellow unemployed journalists drowning your sorrows while discussing the possibility of launching your own news website. Your drunken plans to form a startup are thrown off course when a disembodied voice warns of impending doom just before an explosion draws your attention outside. There you see a smoking crater in the middle of the street where three figures are visible. The supervillain known as the Ox has just broken through the wall of a bank with unmarked bags of cash. The dark and ominous hero known as the Nightwatchman slinks off from the scene. And at the bottom of the crater is the legendary Cosmic Guardian who had disappeared in the 90s. You know any one of these three could be a great news lead, but where could it lead?If you like strange powers from radioactive meteorites, continue on to the next paragraph. If you like brooding antiheroes like Batman, skip to the paragraph after that. If you like interstellar police forces, like the Green Lantern Corps or the Nova Corps, continue on to the third paragraph after this.Trying to find out what Ox is doing in Cleveland, you sneak closer to the scene of the crime. But rather than finding clues, you fall into the crater and black out. When you wake up, you have strange goo-like powers that allow you to change shape, walk on walls and hurl goo. Does great power come with great responsibility? Or a great opportunity for profit?Trying to follow Nightwatchman leads you to one of his secret lairs. There you find Nightwatchman\u2019s suit abandoned. Donning it, you find yourself able to pose as the dark hero. Though you lack his martial skill, you have access to his wonderful toys and can use them to figure out what happened to the real Nightwatchman.Trying to follow the Cosmic Guardian, you find him dying. He passes on his armored superhero suit to you, Can you figure out what the Cosmic Guardian was doing? Can you figure out how to operate the suit? Can you do this before the other Cosmic Guardians catch up with you?I went through the effort to read every branching path in the book I could. I think I got all 90 of them, but I might have missed some. The timeline and cosmology of the book remains the same throughout, it is simply the course you chart through the narrative that changes how things unfold. The story is told with a dose of snarky humor and regular nods to comic book tropes.As said before, this is a choose-your-own-adventure book for adults. This mostly means that it uses some strong language, though nothing that you couldn\u2019t hear on prime time television. It also has no qualms about giving the reader a hard time about some of their choices. My favorite was when you avoid being a superhero and the section opens with, \u201cYou\u2019re reading a choose-your-own-ending book about superheroes, and immediately decide not to become one?\u201dAll told, the book is just plain fun. I read the book through the Kindle app on my phone, which added hyperlinks and a \u201cback\u201d button to make navigating the different branches much easier. And, in fact, the author encourages you to do so. The primary risk I could see for readers is that they just don\u2019t find the author that funny. I laughed pretty hard through the book, but humor is subjective and this might not appeal to everyone. The Chooseomatic website offers a free 70-page sample of Youngmark\u2019s previous book, Zombocalypse Now, so you can decide for yourself if you enjoy the style. ",
            "\u201cThrusts of Justice\u201d by Matt Youngmark is that rare breed of children\u2019s literature successfully repurposed for adults, in this case, a choose-your-own-adventure novel that parodies traditional superhero conventions. I will specifically be reviewing the Kindle edition. tCasting you as a laid-off reporter (which makes the journalist major in me giggle), you\u2019re presented with three different choices, and each will lead to becoming a different sort of superhero. Or supervillain. The novel says it\u2019s open-minded.The writing is occasionally graphic: brains are smashed and throats are cut with equal cheer. Obviously, you will die in this book. A lot. But the writing is so delightfully tongue-in-cheek that rather than be discouraged, I morbidly sought out every single ending. My favorite death is one that involves dying by trying to save the novel\u2019s Lois Lane character expy.The book averts the typical downfall of the choices being too easy and it being all too clear what path you should take. Your options are typically ambiguous enough to spark careful consideration (or in my case, recklessness and promises of coming back later to see where the other option goes). And what you believe will kill is only the first step on a new path. Or it does kill you. I did say you would die a lot.To those who enjoy their superheroes, and even more enjoy having their superheroes deconstructed, I cannot recommend this book enough.",
            "Choose your own adventure on kindle works great :)Loved this book - you really should give it a try. I like the writing style. None of the pages are too short, which was my complaint with some of the original (TM) series when I was little.I, of course, read books like this in a very methodical way - I wouldn't want to miss any of the sections the author has lovingly written for my consumption. This means I choose the first available option each time, wait until I die, and then back up and choose the next option in the list. When I run out of options, I back up again. (For you CS folks out there, that's just a depth-first search). I *loved* that Mr. Youngmark added some special love for readers like me - if you do read in that order, you get an extra meta story from understanding what's happened before as you go down later paths.",
            "Like his first choose your own romp, Thrusts of Justice is just plain fun to read. My only problem with it is I am impatient and cheated once or twice in endings. It's a blast, and is perfect for that I need a quick break frin reality moment!",
            "It turns out the choose-your-own-adventure format works pretty well on Kindle. It had hyperlinks and everything."

        "desc": "Winner of the Pulitzer Prize when it was first published in 1918, ,The Magnificent Ambersons, chronicles the changing fortunes of three generations of an American dynasty. The protagonist of Booth Tarkington's great historical drama is George Amberson Minafer, the spoiled and arrogant grandson of the founder of the family's magnificence. Eclipsed by a new breed of developers, financiers, and manufacturers, this pampered scion begins his gradual descent from the midwestern aristocracy to the working class. Today ,The Magnificent Ambersons, is best known through the 1942 Orson Welles movie, but as the critic Stanley Kauffmann noted, \"It is high time that [the novel] appear again, to stand outside the force of Welles's genius, confident in its own right.\" \",The Magnificent Ambersons, is perhaps Tarkington's best novel,\" judged Van Wyck Brooks. \"[It is] a typical story of an American family and town--the great family that locally ruled the roost and vanished virtually in a day as the town spread and darkened into a city. This novel no doubt was a permanent page in the social history of the United States, so admirably conceived and written was the tale of the Amber-sons, their house, their fate and the growth of the community in which they were submerged in the end.\",Booth Tarkington (1869-1946), a prolific writer who achieved overnight success with his first novel, ,The Gentleman from Indiana, (1899), is perhaps best remembered as the author of the popular Penrod adventures and ,Seventeen, (1916). He was awarded a second Pulitzer Prize for the novel ,Alice Adams, (1921).",

            "This novel was not at all about what I had anticipated it would be, and surprised me in a very good way. Booth Tarkington is one of those names you know, you feel you certainly must have read, but then you realize you never have. I have two of his novels on my Pulitzer challenge, this one and Alice Adams. I am looking forward to the second now that I have sampled the wares.Written in 1918, The Magnificent Ambersons is the story of George Amberson Minafer, a pompous, spoiled, arrogant little SOB who you want to smack around the ears, and who inspires that same desire in many of the people he meets. He is the grandson of a man who has made his own fortune and whose children take the money for granted and spend it. But the world is changing rapidly, the stock market is full of new opportunities, but fraught with risk, there are new inventions everywhere, but it is difficult to sort the ones that will succeed from the ones that won't and you might be tempted to bet that the horse and buggy isn\u2019t going to be usurped by the automobile, much to your own dismay. In short, millionaires are being made and broken and the city is spreading outward, spurred by more mobility, and the influence of a single family is being diminished with the spread.But automobiles have come, and they bring a greater change in our life than most of us suspect. They are here, and almost all outward things are going to be different because of what they bring. They are going to alter war, and they are going to alter peace. I think men\u2019s minds are going to be changed in subtle ways because of automobiles, just how, though, I could hardly guess. But you can\u2019t have the immense outward changes that they will cause without some inward ones, and it may be that George is right, and that the spiritual alteration will be bad for us.Substitute \u201ccomputer\u201d for \u201cautomobile\u201d and you will see that we have witnessed the same kind of society change in our lifetimes. I\u2019m not sure whether that comforts me or not, but it does put a different perspective on what I sometimes view as the out-of-control progress of our world, the progress that doesn\u2019t stop to consider the harm that might be done along with the advancement.There was so much here that I could relate to our own lives and times. Our economy is a shifting sand and technology did to many industries, two of which were my own mainstay, exactly what the auto did to horses.The hubris of those who have inherited wealth, instead of earned wealth, is not something that has changed much either, and I could identify with the thrifty older people, who were viewed as miserly because they wanted their children to hold on to a little of the wealth instead of treating it like a well that could not go dry.George is an enigma, in a way. He is arrogant and self-centered, but he is also proud and intelligent. He could do something with his life, had all the people in his family not treated him like he was a crown prince. Everyone suffers the consequences of the man they have created from the overindulged boy. In this world where we are always trying to buy our children more things, I believe there is some good advice on child rearing in these pages, as well.It\u2019s been the same all his life: everything he did was noble and perfect. He had a domineering nature to begin with, and she let it go on, and fostered it till it absolutely ruled her. I never saw a plainer case of a person\u2019s fault making them pay for having it!You don\u2019t want to like George, but at some point you do, because you feel sorry for him, knowing he is never going to build happiness without laying a solid foundation, but foundations are not something he thinks he needs, he believes his grandfather has laid a foundation that will support him forever. Of all the people who do not see George clearly, George is the worst offender. He never sees himself as he is and never stops to consider that \u201cnoble and perfect\u201d might not be the adjectives that most people would readily apply to him.I loved this quote, Eugene speaking of George:That\u2019s one of the greatest puzzles of human vanity, dear, and I don\u2019t pretend to know the answer. In all my life, the most arrogant people that I\u2019ve known have been the most sensitive. The people who have done the most in contempt of other people\u2019s opinion, and who consider themselves the highest above it, have been the most furious if it went against them. Arrogant and domineering people can\u2019t stand the least, lightest, faintest breath of criticism. It just kills them.Confess, you know someone like this, don\u2019t you? I think all of us do.I could go on quoting this book endlessly. I marked dozens of passages. I will not do that...I will only suggest that you might find it an interesting read if you have any empty space on your TBR. When I started writing this review, I had decided I was giving this a 4-star rating, by the time I got to this point, I realized I really thought it was an amazing book and that it deserved all 5-stars. I like a book that makes me think of things that go beyond the story itself, a book in which the characters are drawn clearly as individuals, but have that element that can make them stand for a society as a whole or a segment thereof. I think the Pulitzer committee got this one right...they don\u2019t always do that.",
            "First and last 100 pages are exquisite - as good as anything I've ever read. Middle section bogs down in some repetition and tedious dialogue as the world passes the Ambersons by and they fritter away their lives in clueless trivialities. Many readers will not be able to stand the uncompromising stubbornness of the spoiled Georgie Amberson Minafer. All in all, what a talent for description and grasp of the novel's time Tarkington has. The style pulls you right along, simple yet not simplistic. The subtitle of the book, written in 1918, might have been How the Automobile Effed up America (both the environment and the communal way of life). Lots of prophecy in that. After reading the book, I thought a fresh revisit of the famous Orson Welles 1942 film version would be illuminating, and I have to say that seeing the film on the heels of this reading changed my perception of the film, for the better. I'd always admired the film, but assumed due to RKO's infamous interference and cutting that the last part of the movie did not jibe with the book and was weak, but this turns out not to be true. After watching the movie I was astonished at the skill of Robert Wise and the RKO editors for managing to keep virtually the entire plot, key scenes and major dialogue exchanges from the book in the film. Where the film is weak in comparison to the book is in conveying how Tarkington expresses the gradual financial, social, and personal downfall of the Ambersons, including their environs and their place as well-known pillars of the community. This takes place incrementally in the book, so that the reader is aware of the acidic decay taking place while the Ambersons seem clueless to it, but it is virtually unremarked in the film until the final minutes, where it is very abrupt and not fully explored in all its implications. Welles gets the mood and plot right, but skimps somewhat on the thematic elements.Also, Tarkington's book makes you feel sorry for George Amberson Minafer when he does get his comeuppance, even though you've hated him throughout the book. I don't get that same sense in the film version. I also believe the true to my own true love quote at the end of the film (which is the same as in the book) is open to a different, and wrong, interpretation in the film. I always thought that the film was implying that Eugene Morgan and Aunt Fanny---looking dewey eyed at one another---were somehow going to thus hook up, which seems all wrong. In the book, it is clear that his true love remains the dead Isabelle Amberson Minafer. By making peace with her son (and Eugene's enemy) George Amberson Minafer, he is thus remaining true to his own true love. The movie seems to twist this for the sake of a happy ending, though perhaps I misread that. Anyway, the film is no substitute for the book, but it is perfectly realized and cast, and both book and film amplify and enlighten aspects of each.: -EG---------FYI: A few of my favorite, thoughtful passages from the book:---------I'm not sure he's wrong about automobiles, he said. With all their speed forward they may be a step backward in civilization--that is, in spiritual civilization. It may be that they will not add to the beauty of the world, nor to the life of men's souls. I am not sure.But automobiles have come, and they bring a greater change in our life than most of us suspect. They are here, and almost all outward things are going to be different because of what they bring. They are going to alter war, and they are going to alter peace. I think men's minds are going to be changed in subtle ways because of automobiles, just how, though, I could hardly guess. But you can't have the immense outward changes that they will cause without some inward ones, and it may be that George is right, and that the spiritual alteration will be bad for us. ----There were the little bunty street-cars on the long, single track that went its troubled way among the cobblestones. At the rear door of the car there was no platform, but a step where passengers clung in wet clumps when the weather was bad and the car crowded. The patrons--if not too absent-minded--put their fares into a slot, and no conductor paced the heaving floor, but the driver would rap remindingly with his elbow upon the glass of the door to his little open platform if the nickels and the passengers did not appear to coincide in number. A lone mule drew the car, and sometimesdrew it off the track, when the passengers would get out and push it on again. They really owed it courtesies like this, for the car was genially accommodating: a lady could whistle to it from an upstairs window, and the car would halt at once and wait for her while she shut the window, put on her hat and cloak, went downstairs, found an umbrella, told the girl what to have for dinner, and came forth from the house.The previous passengers made little objection to such gallantry on the part of the car: they were wont to expect as much for themselves on like occasion. In good weather the mule pulled the car a mile in a little less than twenty minutes, unless the stops were too long, but when the trolley-car came, doing its mile in five minutes and better, it would wait for nobody. Nor could its passengers have endured such a thing, because the faster they were carried the less time they had to spare!----------He can try, said Amberson. He is trying, in fact. I've sat in the shop watching him try for several beautiful afternoons, while outside the windows all Nature was fragrant with spring and smoke. He hums ragtime to himself as he tries, and I think his mind is wandering to something else less tedious--to some new invention in which he'd take more interest.------The Major was engaged in the profoundest thinking of his life. No business plans which had ever absorbed him could compare in momentousness with the plans that absorbed him now, for he had to plan how to enter the unknown country where he was not even sure of being recognized as an Amberson\u2014not sure of anything, except that Isabel would help him if she could. His absorption produced the outward effect of reverie, but of course it was not. The Major was occupied with the first really important matter that had taken his attention since he came home invalided, after the Gettysburg campaign, and went into business, and he realizedthat everything which had worried him or delighted him during this lifetime between then and to-day--all his buying and building and trading and banking--that it all was trifling and waste beside what concerned him now.--------The elevator boy noticed nothing unusual about him and neither did Fanny, when she came in from church with her hat ruined, an hour later. And yet something had happened--a thing which, years ago, had been the eagerest hope of many, many good citizens of the town. They had thought of it, longed for it, hoping acutely that they might live to see the day when it would come to pass. And now it had happened at last: Georgie Minafer had got his come-upance.He had got it three times filled and running over. The city had rolled over his heart, burying it under, as it rolled over the Major's and buried it under. The city had rolled over the Ambersons and buried them under to the last vestige, and it mattered little that George guessed easily enough that most of the five hundred Most Prominent had paid something substantial to defray the cost of steel engraving, etc.--the Five Hundred had heaved the final shovelful of soot upon that heap of obscurity wherein the Ambersons were lost forever from sight and history.Quicksilver in a nest of cracks!Georgie Minafer had got his come-upance, but the people who had so longed for it were not there to see it, and they never knew it. Those who were still living had forgotten all about it and all about him.",
            "\u201cAt the age of nine, George Amberson Minafer, the Major's one grandchild, was a princely terror\u2026\u201dI just wanted to throttle George \u201cGeorgie\u201d Minafer through at least the first half, no, three quarters, of this novel. He is a rude, spoilt, obnoxious and down right cruel child and matures into a uppity, self righteous and still over-indulged young adult. So, it was with this frustrated state of mind I energetically ploughed through this seemingly much underrated 1919 Pulitzer Prize Winner. In fact, Tarkington is one of only two to have received the Pulitzer on two occasions. Applause please.The Ambersons represent the last vestiges of American old money. Set at the start of the 20th century, Booth\u2019s tale is essentially one of social unravelling, the demise of the upper-class and the birth of a modern nation, heralding new technologies, which meant more factories and more employment and more prosperity. The result was the rise of the middle-class, a catalyst for a monumental wave of city building and urban sprawl, effectively changing the shape of the American landscape. But rather than embracing the change and capitalising on new investment opportunities, the Ambersons, particularly George, remain stuck in their old ways, incapable of adapting to the changing world order, in complete denial. That they are about to go down on a fast sinking ship \u2013 Titanic like, refusing to give up their fancies and fineries in the face of inevitable demise, clinging on to their archaic way of living, only makes their fall from grace that much more \u201cmagnificent.\u201d Booth\u2019s characterisation is good \u2013 each of the characters are deeply flawed and frustrating in some way: particularly George for all his arrogance and self righteousness, his mother Isabel for blind adoration of her son in spite of his despicable behaviour \u2013 even when his actions deny her of her own chance of true happiness, his uninspiring father and other spend thrift relatives.Lucy, George\u2019s love interest, and her inventor father, Eugene, are a breath of fresh air. They are symbolic of a new rising class in America, where wealth is made by the man and not simply idly inherited through the family line. Against much mockery, Eugene adheres to his vision to invent the modern automobile, and proves himself, becoming a successful and wealthy entrepreneur. They are modern, embrace the societal changes and the good fortune it brings \u2013 \u201cThere aren't any old times. When times are gone they're not old, they're dead! There aren't any times but new times!Meanwhile, George, in spite of his real affection for Lucy, refuses to submit to his heart \u2013 instead, he remains obstinate, refusing to give up the old way of life even as it slips from beneath him and he falls on his face. But luckily for George, Lucy in all her infinite optimism and wisdom recognises a chip of goodness (somewhere!?) inside George, and in spite of his moodiness, tantrums and rebukes, she remains committed to believing in his reformation, even as years lapse, as \u2013 \u201carrogance turned gentle melts the heart\u2026\u201d And in the end, I must admit I hate George a lot less than at the beginning. In fact, one could say I even started to feel some sympathetic warmth towards him as he starts to right some wrongs.However, this new America is far from perfect. Development, technology and economic prosperity as we know comes at a price. It makes our lives both better and worse at the same time. Booth describes the unfettered urban sprawl, ugly factories and looming skyscrapers, a constant choking haze of pollution and squalid working conditions, particularly for migrants \u2013 \u201cAll the people were soiled by the smoke-mist through which they hurried, under the heavy sky that hung close upon the new skyscrapers, and nearly all seemed harried by something impending\u2026\u201dPerhaps the modern message here is that sometimes we need to hit rock bottom before we are able to realise the only way is up. And then the climb is necessarily hard and bitter, and hopefully we learn from the experience. The world is constantly changing, that rug, always being pulled from beneath us. Sometimes without warning, but most often, we are simply deliberately ignorant of the \u2018writing on the wall\u2019 \u2013 pollution, population explosion, climate change, risk of pandemics etc., are some current examples to name a few. Like Booth\u2019s character\u2019s we must finally realise, that we risk our own destruction if we do not acknowledge the need to change our behaviours, adapt to new realities and ways of living and prepare for a very different future."

            "ABSOLUTEY MAGNIFICENT......... could not put it down!!!!! Review later -- Time to hike! xoxoUpdate:Thank you *Anne*!!!! ...... for telling me about this book! I knew nothing about Booth Tarkington until just a few days ago.For those who might not either, ( okay, maybe just a few of you)...Booth Tarkington was a leading American novelist of the Interwar period. He was famous for this book, \u2018The Magnificent Ambersons\u2019 and \u2018Alice Adams\u2019. Although he was considered by many to be American\u2019s greatest living author in the 1910\u2019s and the 1920\u2019s, being one of only three novelist to win the Pulitzer Prize multiple times, his works are sadly neglected today. I plan to read more of his books. \u2018The Magnificent Ambersons\u2019 won the 1919 Pulitzer Prize.The setting is largely a fictionalized version of Indianapolis and much of it was inspired by the neighborhood of Woodruff Place.Woodruff Place it\u2019s a neighborhood in Indianapolis located about a mile east of downtown, and was once considered to be one of the most affluent neighborhoods before the beginning of a gradual decline as the automobile led to the development of newer upscale subdivisions beginning in the 1910\u2019s. From the start of this story, Tarkington painted a marvelous visional experience of the town.....( almost a character in itself)....with the most enjoyable characters a reader would want to spend time with, from any novel.The story spans over 50 years. We experience the changes through three generations of the aristocratic Amberson family, once the envy by many.....with their wealth and prestigious social status - As the years went by - rural small town society and the Amerson\u2019s fortunes began to decline with the rise of the automobile - and the industrial revolution massively increasing. What makes this book so adoringly charming - are the characters.... especially the relationships between George - Lucy - Isabell - and Eugene. AND THE DIALOGUE: it\u2019s ruthless, gutless, and often humorous in that dry-wonderful way....and simply delicious! And George, poor George? arrogant George? Foolish George? ...George Amberson Minafer....is one heck of an unruly character. The first time he told someone to go to hell, he was only nine years old. And that person was an adult. ( spoiled, snobbish, better-than-thou).... but.....I just couldn\u2019t find it in my heart to hate him And Lucy.... dear beautiful, wise, Lucy.... she is a character to love....George loves her too...Lucy loves him....But.....I\u2019m not spillin the beans .... on how that turns out. This \u2018fall-from-grace\u2019 story was sooooo compulsively and compelling to read ....my entire soul is enriched. HIGHLY HIGHLY HIGHLY RECOMMENDED. A \u2018treat\u2019 read.....A REALLY SPECIAL \u2018classic\u2019!$1.99 Kindle special! SUCH A DEAL!!!!",
            "All the tropes of the All-American novel notwithstanding, the best part of Magnificent Ambersons is the creation of its protagonist, Georgie Amberson, perennial brat &amp, complete a$$hole. His impressions on the town, of which he is the most affluent and expectation-filled member, of the riffraff, are outstandingly hell-air-eeous! There are multiple love stories, some romantic, some familial. There are several dashes with history, especially with the invention of the automobile. Yup, a novel about America with a precocious imp in the center of it. THE stuff Pulitzer Dreams are made of!",
            "The Magnificent Ambersons is the story about the changes in the early 20th Century brought on by the beginnings of the Industrial Age, as seen through the changing fortunes in the lives of one family. It's a wonderful character driven story, told with sharply ironic humor and wit. I enjoyed it far more than I expected, often chuckling and laughing at the wonderful dialogue and the narrator's ironic and haughty descriptions of people and the town. The story flows easily and the characters are wonderfully contrived. I listened to the story in audio which was superbly narrated by Geoffrey Blaisdell.  The setting is a fictional Midwestern American town appropriately named Midland. As the story opens the Ambersons are the richest family in their small town and the pace of life is slow. A lone mule drew the car in good weather. one mile in... 20 minutes..... They had time for everything \u2026 time to think , to talk, to read....to serenade... . During this slow paced time we first meet Isabelle Amberson, as a young beautiful woman. She is being courted, and one of her beaus, Eugene Morgan, in a drunken moment makes a fool of himself while trying to serenade her. This leads Isabelle to choose another boring but safe suitor, Wilbur Minafer. It is the wrong decision because she loves Morgan, not Wilbur, but the Ambersons are all about appearances and pride. These attitudes will be passed down to Isabelle's son, George and will eventually lead George to make decisions for which both he and Isabel (and others) will pay for dearly. When Isabel marries Wilbur Minafer the town gossips, like a greek chorus:She couldn\u2019t love Wilbur Minafer so she\u2019d put all of her love on her children and ruin them.\u201d  Isabel only ends up having one child but the gossips turn out to be right, and all of her love is spent on this one child, George. He is completely spoiled and, naturally, grows up tyrannical and selfish. I had mixed feelings about George, disliking him when he was arrogant and obnoxious but liking his deep sense of loyalty to the few people he loves and for other reasons which show up towards the end of the novel..This story is about a changing world and that change is initially introduced in the persons of Eugene Morgan and his daughter Lucy. Eugene, a manufacturer of horseless carriages, is George's mother old beau. Now widowed, he has returned to set up a shop in the town . At this point George laughs at him both for his lower social position and for the absurdity of believing that a machine can replace a horse. George hates automobiles, and insists that they are nothing more than a passing fad. At the same time he falls in love with Eugene's daughter Lucy. For some reason, she's attracted to George despite the fact that nearly every word he says is off-putting . These sections of the novel are among the most fun. The dialogue between George and Lucy is often hilarious because Lucy never takes to heart George's attempts at domination, his bad humor nor his arrogance.At the same time, Eugene and Isabel start seeing each other again (after George's father dies) and George is appalled when they become engaged. He puts a stop to it in a cruel fashion and Isabel goes along with it. Isabel allows herself to give up Eugene at George's insistence due to his caring too much for appearances and how it would look if she remarried. Isabel says to George,  I shouldn't mind anything if I have you all to myself. For a mother to feel and say that to a son we can see that George had no chance to grow up to be be anything but domineering and arrogant. George knows that by forcing his mother to give up Eugene that he has lost any chance at love with Lucy, so George and Isabel leave for Europe for 3 years and in that time their town is transformed. Tarkington\u2019s descriptions of these transformations are masterful. The small town speeds up and spreads out leading to faster cars, urbanization, decaying neighborhoods, industrial growth, pollution and declining fortunes. When Isabel and George return from Europe the transformations are complete. This includes the rise of Eugene Morgan who is now wealthy and the once-mocked horseless carriage is the coveted automobile while the Amberson district goes downhill. I will say no more so as not to spoil the story as it proceeds from here. A wonderful novel which won the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction in 1919. Highly recommended.",
            "In all my life, the most arrogant people that I've known have been the most sensitive. The people who have done the most in contempt of other people's opinion, and who consider themselves the highest above it, have been the most furious if it went against them. Arrogant and domineering people can't stand the least, lightest, faintest breath of criticism. It just kills them.Now admit it, you got a mental picture of a certain man currently in the news, a man we've all had just about enough of in the last 4 years, didn't you? This book was written more than a hundred years ago, and won the Pulitzer Prize in 1918. So either Booth Tarkington had a crystal ball, or this type of person has been around for all of history.George Amberson Minafer was born with a spoon in his mouth, and his adoring mother and grandfather used that spoon to feed him the belief that he was the most wonderful person ever born, he could do no wrong, and everything he did and said was just perfect. The people of the town were just waiting for the day when George gets his comeuppance. The beauty of this book for me was that George did get his comeuppance in the end, and the journey was long and painful. He is taken down by life, as is everyone in the end. As well as being a satisfying family saga, this book shone an historical light on the early years of the 20th century, with the invention of the automobile and the growth of small villages into sprawling cities, hints at coming pollution, and the downfall of the American spirit when profits and making money took the place of the old ways of thrift and independence. This was an old-fashioned novel in the best way, and I really enjoyed reading it at last.",
            "The Magnificent Ambersons transported me to a mid-western town in the early 1900s at the dawn of the industrial age. As automobiles begin to appear, as soft black coal pollutes the avenues, the most prominent family in town (the Ambersons) are forced to change. The reader feels little sympathy for George or his mother. George's mother is blinded by love for her son and creates a spoiled, self-centered boy and man. George (for most of the novel) is an unlikable combination of privilege, delusion and snobbery. But I didn't need to like George to be riveted by his story. The ending is rushed and felt almost tacked on - otherwise I enjoyed every page of this novel - or rather every word - I listened to an excellent audio rendition by Geoffrey Blaisdell.",
            "Not a memorable story. Descriptions were good but this one wasn't for me.",
            "\u201cThere aren't any old times. When times are gone they're not old, they're dead! There aren't any times but new times!\u201d \u2015 Booth Tarkington, The Magnificent AmbersonsThis is one of those fantastic little classics (it won the Pulitzer Prize's second prize for the Novel category in 1919) that while not exactly ignored, certainly aren't read as frequently today as the author's talent should demand. It was made in 1942 into a movie by Orson Wells (his second film) so it does have that anchor to keep it from slipping further into the darkness of the past. I guess old fiction is like old families. Nothing stays or holds truly. Great Caesar dead and turn'd to clay stopped no hole to keep the wind away, dead Caesar was nothing but tiresome bit of print in a book that schoolboys studyfor awhile and then forget.-- Hamlet, Act V, Scene 1I guess the same can be said of literature. Most books are eventually pulped. Even the good and many, many of the great ones too are soon forgotten. The writer's impulse is for some glimmer of immortality, but memories and readers are damn fickle things. We collectively shrug off and forget those we recently purchased, those banging the publisher's gongs to get attention, and to hell with all those public domain dead writers -- even if they did write such beautiful books.___________________"

        "desc": "The poem is rising into splendid popularity. Some say it is better than Milton-but that is all bosh-nothing can be better than Milton; many say it licks Kalidasa; I have no objection to that. I don't think it impossible to equal Virgil, Kalidasa, and Tasso. Michael Madhusudan Datta wrote this in a letter to a friend about his verse narrative, ,The Slaying of Meghanada, (1861). The epic, a Bengali version of the ,Ramayana, story in which Ravana, not Rama, is the hero, has become a classic of Indian literature. Datta lived in Bengal at the height of what is frequently called the Bengal Renaissance, a time so labeled for its reinvigoration and reconfiguration of the Hindu past and for the florescence of the literary arts. It was also a period when the Bengali city of Kolkata was a center of world trade-the second city of the British empire-and thus a site of cultural exchange between India and the West. Datta was the perfect embodiment of this time and place. ,The Slaying of Meghanada, is deeply influenced by western epic tradition, and is sprinkled with nods to Homer, Milton, and Dante. Datta's deft intermingling of western and eastern literary traditions brought about a sea change in South Asian literature, and is generally considered to mark the dividing line between pre-modern and modern Bengali literature. Datta's masterpiece is now accessible to readers of English in Clinton Seely's elegant translation, which captures both the sense and the spirit of the original. The poem is supplemented by an extensive introduction, notes, and a glossary.",

            "Son of Thunder, by Murray J.D. Leeder is part of the Forgotten Realms shared D&amp,D setting, and part of the Fighters series. The series is more like an anthology than an actual series, with each entry about different characters and by a different author, with only the thematic connection that they all feature a protagonist that's a fighter or warrior of some sort. Overall, while I like most of the Forgotten Realms books, this particular series has been pretty weak. In addition, this is a first novel by the author, which is always a bit of a crap shoot. Therefore, going into this book, I wasn't expecting much. I was happily surprised that this was actually a very good book, with lots of character development, interesting settings and challenges, and is very faithful to both D&amp,D and to the Forgotten Realms setting.The story focuses on the Thunderbeast barbarian tribe of the North. This is a tribe that has lost its ties to its historic past and way of life, and the new chief therefore holds a religious rite with the entire tribe, to pray for guidance. At the conclusion of this rite, Vell the Brown, a warrior of the tribe of no special importance is selected and gifted with the supernatural powers of the tribe's totem beast, and must lead a quest to bring the tribe back to it's former glory. Vell must not only face the physical challenges that lay before him, but the psychological challenges of dealing with both the destiny laid before him, as well as the real danger of losing himself to the beast that takes over when he enters battle. Along the way, he meets an outlander sorceress, who further challenges his worldview, as well as representatives of the evil Zhentarim secret society. Leeder takes the reader through the High Forest, an area rarely detailed in either game product or fiction, and skillfully weaves in many bits of realmslore, including history of the Uthgardt barbarian tribes, the ancient empire of Netheril, the Empire of Shade, the Unicorn Run, and the previously mentioned Zhentarim and High Forest. Plus, if all that isn't enough, the book features dinosaurs! Highly recommended.",
            "Better than the last two, but not saying much. Kind of a cool concept, but the Thunderbeast is an APATOSAURUS? Seriously? Interesting choice, but come on. There are so many rockin' predatory dinosaurs to choose from.",
            "This is an all around decent fantasy read. Nothing really stuck out as amazing and nothing really stuck out as anything really bad. I enjoyed the book and I would read more from Mr. Leeder. "

            "Good science fiction makes you think. Pulp science fiction entertains you. Great science fiction, on the other hand, makes you think while entertaining you. Such is the case with Machine by Jennifer Pelland.The concept at the heart of the story is an interesting one, and even though it's been done before, it's never been done quite like this. In the not-too-distant future, science has managed to create entirely human-looking android bodies into which human thoughts and emotions can be copied. It's a technology that was designed for the benefit of terminally ill patients with incurable diseases, allowing them a chance to live while they wait for a cure, although it's starting to become something of a cosmetic procedure as well, despite the overwhelming political and religious objections.The novel follows the story of Celia, a young woman with a rare genetic disease that's a low priority on the medical research front. She wakes up from the copy-over process, acting, feeling, and thinking exactly as she did in her old body. For her, there is no change, and no awareness of being different from what she was before. Unfortunately, her wife doesn't see it the same way, and Celia awakes to find herself divorced . . . alone . . . shunned by the woman she loves, who refused to cheat on the woman she loves with a soul-less copy.D.B. Story's Fembot Chronicles, which I've reviewed her many times of the past few years, are some of my favourite stories to deal with the concept of mechanical beings and self-awareness. There, the focus on the story was on robots acquiring sentience, and fighting for rights they never had. Here, with Machine, the focus is instead on humans becoming something less-than-human in the transition, and fighting for the right to distinguish themselves from what they have lost.On the one hand, it's a rather dark and disturbing reality with which we're presented, with Celia and her new found friends illegally modifying themselves to look less than human since society's rejection has made them feel less than human. It begins with Celia slicing open her finger to see the ceramic 'bone' beneath, and quickly progresses from there. Polished chrome skin, featureless mannequin-like bodies, and glowing eyes are the physical aspect, with the ability to suppress emotions, voluntarily go into lockdown, and play with the sensitivity of their pain/pleasure receptors is another. Like I said, it's almost heartbreaking to see the lengths to which they feel forced to modify themselves, even as we share in the exhilaration of freedoms and feelings otherwise impossible for the rest of humanity. The voluntary fetishization of their condition is oddly confusing, coming across as erotic and exciting when they fetishize one another, but disgusting and inexcusable when they play to human kinks.As part of her exploration of what it means to be human, Jennifer does an amazing job of dealing with questions of sexuality and gender. Celia, as I mentioned previously, is a lesbian, although it's entirely inconsequential in the future presented. Other than one instance where another character reminds her that her marriage would once have been as controversial as her new body, her sexuality is a complete non-issue. Similarly, we get to explore some interesting ideas of gender through Celia's augmented friends, including one who can alter his gender at will to be male, female, or a combination of the two, and another who is entirely featureless and androgynous since, as it points out, robots do not have a gender.If I were to voice one complaint, it would be over the ambiguity of the ending, but I realised that was intentional. Celia's fate is what we make of it, and that brings us right back to the concept of making you think while entertaining you. I realise I haven't done the story justice, but hopefully I've highlighted enough of the elements handled so masterfully by Celia that you'll want to give it a read.",
            "Celia Krajewski is unsure of how long she has to live. None of us do, really, but for Celia the matter is a bit more pressing, as she's recently discovered she carries a gene for a rare mutation that will eventually destroy her mind. She has an out, though, she can place her body in statis, transferring her mind and personhood to a bioandroid body so that she can continue living until a cure is found.Death always demands payment, though, and Celia's attempt to cheat it comes with the cost of her marriage, her wife refuses to see Celia as the 'real' Celia, claiming that to be with her robotic body would amount to infidelity. This starts Celia questioning exactly how human her new self is. Eventually, she starts to hurt herself, to remind herself of her humanity. To her surprise, she finds that she starts to like the pain. And that she's not the only bioandroid who feels that way.While the science fictional elements of Machine are absolutely essential parts of it, they are not the central focus of it, instead, Pelland wisely chooses to focus her story on Celia's attempts to retain a feeling of humanity as she starts to lose many of the relationships with others that define who we are, our romantic relationships, friendships, hobbies and career choices are so often a part of our self-definition that to be stripped of them can remove that feeling of humanity from any of us, if only momentarily, to be stripped in that way while inside a biomechanical body that only reinforces those feelings of nonhumanism.Beyond the character study of Celia, Machine also has some interesting things to say about the interplay of individual rights and collective good. Given the subject matter of the book, it would be very easy to think of Machine as a book that would argue that individual rights are always paramount, and the first-person narration that Celia provides definitely seems to support that. \u201cBody autonomy\u201d, as it is phrased in the book, is understandably important for all the mechanical characters, and it is the realization that she lacks that that drives Celia to make some of the choises that she does in the course of the story. However, as first-person narrators are inherently unreliable, it's important to look beyond Celia's opinion and see what's actually happening. The reality that we can observe when we look beyond Celia is that all of the crises that Celia faces throughout the book stem from others using their own bodily autonomy \u2013 their 'free will', to use a somewhat loaded term \u2013 without regard to how those choices will impact others. The regularity with which that occurs doesn't seem to be coincidental, but rather seems to be a statement from the author on the need to balance one's own self-discovery and actualization with the knowledge of how that will affect others around them.The human characters in Celia's story are fascinating and self-contradictory. Most of those that recognize that there is still humanity in her, or at least claim to, refuse ultimately to treat her as human, instead objectifying her and using her as a tool for their own ends. Within the moral framework of the story, this objectification is somewhat defensible \u2013 it could be argued, after all, that they're operating with the same desire for individualistic autonomy that Celia desires \u2013 but it is still ultimately counterproductive and serves only to increase Celia's feelings of separation and otherness from her new body.Machine was, at times, a hard book to read. The emotional power of Pelland's writing left me breathless at a few points, and the depths that Celia is willing to go to prove her remaining humanity to herself will no doubt be shocking to some readers. The tragedy that sits at its core makes it a very rewarding read, Jennifer Pelland manages to put a very human and humanistic face on a subgenre that at times tries to flee from those descriptors.(note: Apex Publications provided a copy of Machine for review).",
            "If I had to describe this book in one word that word would be disturbing, but that isn't necessarily a bad thing.I won't go into much detail so I don't ruin it for you, but Machine is the thought provoking story of a woman, Celia, who takes on an android body while her biological body is held in stasis until a cure can be found for her rare form of Alzheimer's. The woman has few friends to support her during her greatest time of need. She faces many unforeseen struggles in her new life as a bioandroid and has trouble coping with living in the mechanical body. To top off her problems, her wife, who she loves dearly, has divorced her because she didn't support decision to use a biomechanical body. A disturbing scene of a future that is all too plausible is what this book delivers. The future depicted may very well be what we as a society are on our way to becoming as we continue our scientific endeavors. The author explores the various reactions to the bioandroid program from love to hate to begrudging acceptance and everything in between. The well written characters bring a level of realism to the story of Celia's struggle to accept her new body for what it truly is, a machine.Machine leaves you wondering what the future of mankind may hold and how we will adapt to the inevitable changes and advances coming our way. How far of a stretch is it that we may one day be living in mechanical bodies? How would such bodies be abused and how would the world cope with such a thing?",
            "_Machine_ is an engaging exploration of somataphobia, mostly that of main character Celia's hatred of her temporary body which she endeavors to variously control, punish, and annihilate when she learns that her wife rejects it. (Another, more generalized version of somataphobia, in which certain characters desire to permanently replace their bodies with immortal machinery that they consider perfect in comparison with the weakness and imperfection of their somatic bodies, is simply noted often, without exploration.) My problem with _Machine_, though, is that it couples a fantastic, logically impossible premise with an sfnal story. Fantasy can sometimes be meshed with sf, but not when the narrative style is that of non-playful straightforward psychological realism. The novel's foundational assumption is that Cartesian dualism-- the belief that mind exists apart from the body-- is literally true, when in fact the last half century of neuroscience has shown that consciousness (mind) is in an artifact of the neurological processes of the brain and central nervous system (i.e., the body), and not an entity that can be neatly downloaded into a machine and then continue to function as a discrete entity quite apart from the processes that have been producing it. As I read _Machine_, I kept waiting for the other shoe to drop. (Granted, I was a bit puzzled at the beginning when Celia woke from the transfer process and experienced no difficulty standing, walking, using her hands, etc., without training or practice of any kind.) We are told repeatedly that Celia's machine body is simulating the emotions and physical responses of a somatic body, but the more this was repeated to me, the harder it became for me to quash my need to question just what kind of brain a machine might have that it could reproduce consciousness and hormonal flows so seamlessly that Celia never ever perceived a difference between her somatic body and her machine body. Of course, our brains are creating bridges all the time in order to maintain a sense of seamless continuity and sensory construction of the world. But would a machine brain be able to do that, too? The narrative, in its constant invocation of Cartesian dualism, never once hints that anything quite that complex is involved in its android bodies and never admits that the mind is inseparable from the body that produces it. This is consistent with Celia's view, of course, in her desire to punish and control the body her wife has rejected. But given how often experts are allowed to speak their expertise in this novel, the absence of a more sophisticated view (one that acknowledges the obsolescence of Celia's belief in mind/body dualism) is glaring. ",
            "Whether you call it science fiction, or speculative fiction, or sociological fiction, or any other term, the genre field is about technological advances, but more importantly, what those changes in technology mean to us as humans. The best examples show us how people's lives are altered with this new leap in the sciences-- what about us changes, and what remains essentially the same. The humanity of the story is what truly matters. In Machine, the humanity of the story is all, as it should be. Jennifer Pelland gives us a heart-rending tale of a life altered by a technological advance. When science can put our consciousness into a mechanical body, who would want to go back to their fleshly frame? When there are, in effect, two of you, which is the real one? Does that term have significance anymore? How would your loved ones react to your mind in a different shell? These questions and more pop up in this masterful book. So many different viewpoints are shown as to what people would think about the technique, and what happens to those who undergo it. There are religious and ethical protesters, opportunists, fetishists, and others who are portrayed against the personal struggle of one woman to keep her identity and life together. When, for medical reasons, the protagonist Celia Isoke Krajewski undergoes the procedure to put her fleshly body in stasis while she lives in a mechanical copy, she awakens to find that in the eyes of some, she is now a monster. Those now opposed to her include her nearest and dearest loved ones. She soon becomes an outcast, separated from all she has known. She finds unlikely allies in her struggle to understand who she now is and what that means. The book realistically shows that although society changes in regard to some personal choices, people in the book continue to hold bigoted opinions about what others are doing with their bodies and selves. The characters are tolerant about their own choices, but demand that others submit to a different standard. So we have a grand example of a book that examines what it is to be human when the boundaries of humanity are stretched and morphed into alternatives. Is it an evolution or an abomination? Machine will make you think and give you a new understanding about identity, gender, and beliefs. When you have finished with Machine and want to read more by this talented author, get her book of stories, Unwelcome Bodies, with further explorations of identity and change. ",
            "If the author had set aside her ideology and just focused on story, this would be a five star book, but unfortunately, despite being hard to put down, the story suffers under the weight of the preachy tone. Questions could have been asked and left up to readers to decide how they come down on the issue. But that doesn't happen here enough. And that's too bad, because there's a rollicking good Science Fiction tale underneath, one I found it hard to tear my eyes away from. But just when I was getting wrapped up again, the sledgehammer slung through with another ideological sermon and ruined the moment. I dislike ideological blathering in the guise of fiction, whether the ideology matches my own or not. In spite of that, the book is a fascinating tale set in a fascinating, well built world with a well drawn lead and some nicely handled, though thinly drawn supporting characters. The plot and pacing are almost spot on, except for the above mentioned preaching issue. The book just carries you along, infusing you with a desire to find out what happens next. The tale of a woman diagnosed with a rare, bad version of Alzheimers who takes advantage of future tech to have her brain and memories transferred into a biorobotic body until a cure can be found, while he fleshly body lies in stasis, Machine asks some truly fascinating questions about science. How far should it go and at what cost? Just because we have the technology, does that make it right to use it? Are there other questions we should ask? It's compelling and emotional and fascinating. Too bad the ideological lectures got in the way. None of those political things is essential to the story which already has so many deep questions to ask and does just by its plot and circumstances. The politics distract focus and would not be missed if they weren't there. Still, Pelland shows great talent as a writer and storyteller and I have no problem understanding why it found a willing publisher. There were probably several.",
            "It has been a week since I finished it and cannot get it out of my mind. This is such a fantastic book.I've always been a huge sci-fi fan. Not so much the Hark, an alien type but more the what if XYZ happens a hundred years from now. Realistic sci-fi for the lack of a better term (or is that an oxymoron?)The book centers around the idea that the human thoughts and memories of a terminally ill patient can be transferred into a bio-android body. The body of the patient is then put into stasis pending the discovery of a cure. The bio-android body is an exact copy of the human and people cannot tell the difference between a human and a bio-android.The protagonist is Celia, a woman who was recently put in a bio-android body. Instead of going home and living her life as before (probably the biggest selling point used by the bio-android industry) she finds everything turned upside down. She struggles with the duality of her existance to such an extend that she decides to embrace the mechanical side of herself. The pain of everday existance becomes to much and she decides on a course of action which will purge her of the emotional pain assailing her.We have all probably been at a stage where we wished we could turn our emotions off and from that perspective I had immense empathy with Celia and what she decides to do with her body.The book is dark and different. The story grabs hold of you and refuses to let go. It is as if Celia, despite her actions to the contrary, wants to scream to the world that she is still human.The sci-fi is not so much sci-fi but more What if. The technology is a mere prop to the intensely human story that the author tells. The author does not fall into the trap of trying to describe the technology and the science in detail. It is mentioned in passing and the author concentrates her efforts in telling a riveting story of a broken hearted woman.Highly, highly recommended."

Entering a room with stainless-steel tables topped by corpses in body bags is shocking no matter how long you've prepared yourself, but a strange thing happened when Montross met her cadaver. Instead of being disgusted by her, she was utterly intrigued-intrigued by the person the woman once was, humbled by the sacrifice she had made in donating her body to science, fascinated by the strange, unsettling beauty of the human form. They called her Eve. This is the story of Montross and Eve-the student and the subject-and the surprising relationship that grew between them. , ,Body of Work, is a mesmerizing, rarely seen glimpse into the day-to-day life of a medical student-yet one that follows naturally in the footsteps of recent highly successful literary renderings of the mysteries of medicine such as Atul Gawande's ,Complications: A Surgeon's Notes on an Imperfect Science,. Christine Montross was a poet long before she became a doctor and brings an uncommon perspective to the emotional difficulty of the first year of medical school-the dispiriting task of remaining clinical and detached while in the anatomy lab and the struggle with the line you've crossed by violating another's body once you leave it. , Montross was so affected by her experience with Eve that she undertook to learn more about the history of cadavers and the study of anatomy. She visited an autopsy lab in Ireland and the University of Padua in Italy where Vesalius, a forefather of anatomy, once studied; she learned about body snatchers and grave-robbers and anatomists who practiced their work on live criminals. Her disturbing, often entertaining anecdotes enrich this exquisitely crafted memoir, endowing an eerie beauty to the world of a doctor-in-training. ,Body of Work, is an unforgettable examination of the mysteries of the human body and a remarkable look at our relationship with both the living and the dead.",

            "When she was training to become a doctor in Rhode Island, Montross and her anatomy lab classmates were assigned an older female cadaver they named Eve. Eve taught her everything she knows about the human body. Montross is also a published poet, as evident in her lyrical exploration of the attraction and strangeness of working with the remnants of someone who was once alive. She sees the contrasts, the danger, the theatre, the wonder of it all:\u201cStacked beside me on my sage green couch: this spinal column that wraps into a coil without muscle to hold it upright, hands and feet tied together with floss, this skull hinged and empty. A man\u2019s teeth.\u201d\u201cWhen I look at the tissues and organs responsible for keeping me alive, I am not reassured. The wall of the atrium is the thickness of an old T-shirt, and yet a tear in it means instant death. The aorta is something I have never thought about before, but if mine were punctured, I would exsanguinate, a deceptively beautiful word\u201dAll through her training, Montross has to remind herself to preserve her empathy despite a junior doctor\u2019s fatigue and the brutality of the work (\u201cThe force necessary in the dissections feels barbarous\u201d), especially as the personal intrudes on her career through her grandparents\u2019 decline and her plans to start a family with her wife \u2013 which I gather is more of a theme in her next book, Falling into the Fire, about her work as a psychiatrist. I get through a whole lot of medical reads, as any of my regular readers will know, but this one is an absolute stand-out for its lyrical language, clarity of vision, honesty and compassion.",
            "Montross' story of her hands on experience in dissecting a cadaver dubbed Eve to learn anatomy grows monotonous with each dissection tale and learning. What saves the book is interwoven history. Dissections were at one time a public event. I was more fascinated with the historical rendering of the supply of bodies for dissection via grave digging, than I was of reading about the slow dissection of Eve's body. Of course, freshness was an issue in the days lacking \u201ccold storage\u201d, thus the newly dead garnered more money for grave robbers providing the cadavers. Apparently, folks in those days felt digging up recently killed criminals was less offensive. Interesting tidbits, including the revelation that \u201cdura matter\u201d literally translates to \u201ctough mother\u201d are strewn throughout enough to keep one reading to the end."

            "Fascinating!A fascinating account of this acceptable taboo subject - namely, the medical dissection of the human body by medical students. This one is up close and personal, because the author is one of the students. She takes us through the entire semester - or more precisely the spiritual journey she undergoes. We follow Ms. Montross through her development - both human and medical. She is obviously anguished by what she has to do in the medical lab - and her reactions and expos\u00e9 give the book great beauty. We can feel her growth, she makes incredible connections between her lab work and internship with live patients. She realizes that the extreme awkwardness and cutting to exposure ALL parts of the human body is also a preparation for dealing with real people who may be terminally ill, have grotesque disfigurations, etc...  Like all medical students she must learn to balance feelings and discomfort when listening to patients - but not at the loss of giving just a cold clinical diagnosis. We also get a sense of the mental and physical stress that these students undergo - not all of them make it through the entire term. They are in their own special club - and those outside the club cannot properly relate to them. Ms. Montross gives us wonderful insights into this club.  Another aspect of the book I liked was its lack of criticisms. This is not a book that rails against the medical profession and those in it. It treats all from the body undergoing dissection to the students, doctors and patients with a great deal of humanism and respect.  She also gives a history of anatomical dissection and how bodies were acquired (more often stolen) in past eras. Given the subject this is not easy reading - it is necessarily morbid. I did not have nightmares, but the words in the book remain with you - as does any good book. ",
            "Instantly became a favorite.A great memoir about a very sensitive subject, and from a sensitive person.As a doctor and a cardiac surgeon this book touched me deeply.I felt like i have written it myself with all these feelings and thoughts.In the anatomy lab we dissect cadavers as we should do, but more importantly we dissect our lives, our bodies, our existence.This memoir is very personal, deeply personal and existential that it touches every reader.I will read it again and again, as you should.",
            "Extremely eloquent, sobering while at the same time comforting. Anything more I could say would only detract from Montross's gorgeous prose.5 stars. Montross does the impossible: she puts the indescribable into words and gives a lucid, tender, heartfelt account of the inexpressible. It is a perfectly balanced juxtaposition of body and emotion, of human form and human spirit.",
            "Perhaps not the book to read during a pandemic, interesting none the less. Some information I already knew, some I did not. More interesting, the author has a masters in POETRY and is accepted into medical school. No science background what so ever required. Perchance the arts and the biological sciences together do make for a better physician and in this case psychiatrist. ",
            "Kind of a mixed book for me. The author makes a binary distinction between the reactions of students to the anatomy lab, I definitely did not fall into the same category, and occasionally was annoyed by Montross's insistent language making her reactions seem like the proper ones to have. Growing up with a family that openly talked about human dissection at the dinner table (mom's an anatomy teacher) likely already prepared me emotionally for the dissections.The examination of the history of anatomy study is what saved the book from the tossing pile for me. Nice to see that Montross did her research. That being said, I'm curious to know what dissection manual her school used. I was stunned when the instructor said that they would be removing the heart on the first day in the anatomy lab, mainly due to the work involved with getting to that point from a new body combined with the students' inexperience in dissection and the fine structures that could easily be destroyed by a slip of the scissors. And the method described for removing the lungs seemed unnecessarily dangerous to the students, but these thoughts are more personal than critical of the book.Overall, a nice book, tailor made for a gift to an incoming medical student, however, not quite as good of an examination on the experience as other books could be.

As an aside, it should be noted that the FBI in June 2004 declared ecoterrorism to be a bigger threat to domestic security than Al Qaeda. The rumor that the Sea Shepherd society had been named an ecoterrorist group is bogus.The quixotic nature of the Sea Shepherd campaign is obvious from the moment Peter Heller (correspondent for National Geographic) steps aboard the Farley Mowat for a month-long trip to the southern oceans in hopes of finding the whaling fleet. The southern ocean is a huge place roughly the size of all the western states from Mexico to Canada and east to a vertical line drawn north and south parallel to the Colorado eastern border. So for the ancient Farley Mowat to search for the Japanese whalers is like leaving Denver in an old pickup truck to try to find four other vehicles in the western states but not knowing where they might be. The crew are certainly dedicated, if inexperienced and ill-trained: half had never been to sea, the helicopter pilot had never flow the particular type of helicopter they needed to rely on, they had no helicopter mechanic on board, the assumption seemed to be good intentions substitutes for competence. The ship was registered as a yacht so they could avoid paying higher fees and more importantly did not need to have licenses for the officers. To give you an idea. On their first stop at Hobart they anchor (mistakenly dropping both instead of one), after being cleared by customs they take two zodiacs in, one gets loaded to the gills with liquor and swamps on the way back so they begin throwing the liquor boxes overboard, on the other a crew member drops a VHF radio over the side (that represented \u2153 of their handheld radio communications.) In the meantime two jet-ski drivers took their craft for a spin around the ship, showboating, if you will, one flips and the engine is ruined. There goes half of their small-craft-for-running-around-the-whale-ships-boats. The captain is in the radio room preparing PR. Is he concerned by the flubs. Not a bit. Apparently, it was common practice for Greenpeace ships to take out whatever wharf they intended to tie up to. Heller inspects the safety gear and decides to buy his own. This to venture into some of the most dangerous waters on earth.Their mission is to aggressively interfere with whaling wherever possible, even if it means sinking ships (they claim credit for having sunk fifteen, most relating to Arctic whaling that was clearly illegal.) Sectarian disputes are common. You have freegans, vegans and vegetarians all thrown in together, the use of honey by one could bring on an active donnybrook. One thing most could agree on was that humans are evil and the world would be better off without them. It should be noted that of the 44 people on board for the trip Heller documents, 7 were journalists and videographers. Media coverage is absolutely crucial to the campaign. They had no direct responsibilities in operating the ship and answered to no one although they were expected to follow whatever rules Watson dictated on any given day. Paul Watson makes no apologies for manipulating the media, arguing that\u2019s the only way to get the message across. No doubt he\u2019s correct and Whale Wars, the TV show furthers that goal. I am through #5 of Season 3 and so enjoying the amateur antics and buffoonery of these well-meaning folks. Hysterical. Bunch of rank amateurs (but very committed) running around pretending to be doing something useful. The captain of the Bob Barker, barely refitted, no sea trials after engine rebuild, 60 yrs old, having engine trouble, steers right into the middle of a terrific storm, putting his ship, the mission, and the crew at terrible risk (his first time as ship captain, he only managed yachts before) and justifying it by saying if they can save 10 hrs they can save some whales, but there's no guarantee Watson's plan for two ships will work at all. What a bunch of yahoos. And Watson as a captain? He stands around clueless most of the time. Any captain worth his salt would have had the crew practicing launching the zephyrs over and over until they could do it in their sleep. Instead, they wait until they are confronted with the Japanese ship for what appears to be a first-time effort. Ridiculous. Shame, because the whaling should stop. But these guys are a joke. Fun to watch, though. The question of what to do remains. It\u2019s all well and good to tell those who\u2019s livelihood depends on some activity to stop doing it when it hurts the requester not at all. We have to figure out a way to put teeth into international treaties (I\u2019d say use the money spent on the Sea Shepherd activities to bribe (oh, I\u2019m sorry, I meant to say campaign contributions) legislators. But at the same time, help those affected find alternative and profitable ways to make a good living. Any pain that results has to be shared. I was struck by the most treasured item on the Farley Mowat, a huge wide-screen TV and a substantial collection of videos and DVDs. Cell phones and high-end electronics are ubiquitous. The production of computers and wide-screen TVs is perhaps just as destructive -- if not more-- to the environment and many people, as killing whales. Watson\u2019s stateroom is larger than the bridge and was remodeled at a cost of $75,000 -- donated, but perhaps money could be better spent. Finding a balance in a tightly-coupled world will be your generation\u2019s challenge.Humans are very efficient killers, of each other, and of other species. The lesson of this book might also be that the best thing for the earth would be human extinction.Peter Heller has written a fascinating, sympathetic, yet not uncritical (he was dismayed when he discovered a .50 caliber sniper rifle and shotguns on board) book about the Sea Shepherd group. This is peripherally also a study of the true believer and how assumptions dictate their actions. Those facts or events that don't meet their assumptions are discarded. I am a fan of whales. I am not a fan of Paul Watson, but if one of the goals was to get you to think twice before eating, Heller succeeded.References: http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment...",
            "It is difficult to review a book about a subject which one feels conflicted yet passionate about. Do I merely critique the writing? I don't think I can do that. The author, Peter Heller, is a journalist for Outside and a contributor to NPR, and besides that he lives in Denver, so you know which side of nature the man is on. Yes, he may be conflicted about Sea Shepherd as an organization, but he obviously wants to save the whales and the oceans and any attempt by Heller to seem objective was met by me, the reader, as laughable. I found his description of Sea Shepherd's voyage to the coast of Antarctica thrilling at times, whereas other times he was able to capture the ennui and tedium of being trapped on a boat in the middle of nowhere while trying to find a Japanese whaling expedition. (Needle in a haystack, anyone?)Having previously read about Captain Paul Watson in a lengthy New Yorker article, I appreciated that Heller concentrated on depicting the mostly volunteer crew. Yes, he makes fun of their vegan ways, but he is able to discern the myriad of personal and political reasons they have for embarking on such a journey.And so this is the point in the review where I want to ramble on about my views of Sea Shepherd. One of the critiques I found missing in the book (and there are many critiques about their lack of social sensitivity, use of violence, sometimes inept crew), is that their approach mirrors that of zoos. I'm serious. It's a top-down approach: Focus on the largest mammals at the expense of the less cute species that provide the foundation for the ecosystem--in this case krill. Yes, I want to save the whales, but perhaps to save the whales we should focus more on the acidity of the sea, the death of coral reefs, and over-fishing, which in turn, spells out the death of whales. Then again, focusing on whales is far more spectacular, I don't think anyone would buy the SAVE THE KRILL t-shirt I'd like to make. I just wish organizations such as Sea Shepherd would show the connections, because I'm not sure people are willing to think beyond the whales.",
            "The whale warriors by Peter Heller certainly Paul Watson and his followers are that warriors. Doing work that is so important, trying to stop the useless slaughter of magnificent creatures. It completely blew me away written 10 years ago but the battle still continues check sea shepherd on you tube. Why don't our governments push back harder against the whaling nations its because we trade with them and its worth millions, money and greed always trumps right and correct. I feel humans are on a slippery slope with all our destruction to all enviroments around us we are going to pay for it one way or the other.",
            "My introduction to Peter Heller (once I realized he wasn't Robocop actor Peter Weller) was his recent interview on Fresh Air to talk about his first novel. I'm sure I'll read it as I eat up post-apocalyptic novels, but I was more fascinated to hear about his work as an outdoor adventure writer. I've read little in this genre, but after hearing him I put everything he wrote on hold at the library. I was excited to learn that he wrote a book about Paul Watson and the Sea Shepherds, whom I was fascinated with in my younger days. This book did not disappoint. He manages to construct an exciting narrative out of a journey which must have been mostly days of tedious boredom at sea. He also grapples with the moral and ethical issues of the methods Watson and his crew use to confront whalers, but also gives us a dispiriting picture of the damage we've been wreaking on the oceans.

            "My first introduction to Captain Paul Watson was in the documentary Shark Waters. In that situation I thought he came off as very heroic. After that I saw the Animal Planet series about the Sea Shepherd and I began to see the captain and crew in more of a critical light. This book led me towards more mixed feelings about Sea Shepherd. I should start by saying that because they are preventing whales from being slaughtered I think they are doing something that is extremely important and I\u2019m very thankful they are doing what they do.However, there are a number of small issues I have that prevent me from fully endorsing the organization, at least as they\u2019ve been portrayed in this book and on the TV series. My main issue is that the crew seems under-trained to the point of absurdity and in the conditions encountered in the Southern Ocean this is almost criminal. At times it seems to be more of a party boat than anything else and a lot of the volunteers don\u2019t even have basic seamanship skills. That they allow alcohol on these missions is mind boggling to me. I find Paul Watson\u2019s FU to anyone who disagrees him attitude to be both a asset and a detriment. His whales first philosophy is admirable but I wonder if he wouldn\u2019t get more accomplished and save more whales if he was a little more diplomatic and at times what seems to be Greenpeace-envy appears to influence his judgment. The racist attitudes towards Japanese were off putting to me as well. There was no distinction made between the Japanese whaling industry, the Japanese government and the Japanese people. I got the sense from this book that the crew held the entire nation of Japan responsible. They spoke of the Japanese as nips and japs but the Norwegian and Icelandic whalers were never referred to in those types of racial terms. Again, I really admire what they are doing and I\u2019m glad they are doing it, I just wonder if there are better ways to go about it and if they\u2019d get more support if they took steps to appear less like a floating frat house. To me, the most moving part of the book was the afterword. In fact I think I will keep the book just for that portion of it. Reading about the dolphin and small whale slaughter is incredibly sad and I challenge anyone who scoffs at the \u201cSave the Whales\u201d campaign to read that section without being deeply affected. I enjoyed Peter Heller\u2019s writing style and the way he presented the information. One element I was wondering about that wasn\u2019t covered was if there is much public outcry about whaling in Japan, Norway and Iceland. I think some attention to that topic would have been more interesting than the space devoted to the personality traits of the crewmembers. ",
            "This book will be of great interest to those of us who are into ecology, saving the dying species, and saving the world. Most of us know about Greenpeace and what they do, but how many of us are aware of Sea Shepard Conservation Society. The Sea Shepard Group make Greenpeace look like a knitting society. This group has no qualms about ramming a whaling ship or fouling its propeller with chain links.The Whale Warriors tell about how difficult and expensive it is for the Sea Shepard Group to put its ship the Farley Mowat into operation. Some times it takes a year or more just to make one run at the whaling ships. Peter Heller tells of one such operation. The majority of the crew is not paid and must suffer the hazards of the open sea. The operations take place in Antarctica where it is very cold and the seas can swell to thirty feet or more. The area that they search for the whaling ships is so immense that contact is sometimes made only by chance. In this particular operation they made contact only twice and were able to do little to further their cause.The best part of the book gives insight into why whaling continues to exist when the species are endangered and very little use is made out of the by-product of whaling.Japan, which is the worst offender, uses very little of the meat of the whale and prices are so low that it is less than profitable. It also shows how Japanese whaling is based on a sham that it is for research.Paul Watson who is the founder of Sea Shepard and the captian of the Farley Mowat thinks nothing of putting himself or his crew in harms way. More than once he has offered his own life, and the lives of his crew, in defense of a whale. To give you an idea about how dedicated he is, he has written, The pyramids, the Old Masters, the symphonies, sculpture, architecture, film, photography...All fo these things are worthless to the Earth when compared with any one species of bird, insect, or plant.",
            "At the bottom of the globe near Antarctica, there is a battle going on between Japanese whalers and activists (eco-pirates) who are trying to save the wales. The Farley, captained by Paul Watson who runs the Sea Shepherd Conservation Society, is out to stop whaling for good, by any means necessary. While whaling is mostly illegal, the Japanese get around the laws by saying they are doing it for research.Fighting to stop whaling is part waiting (it can take weeks to find the ships), and part high action. Watson has previously sunk eight whaling ships and the Farley is outfitted with a seven-foot blade on the bow, bottles of smelly acid to throw aboard whaling vessels, and water cannons.Peter Heller joined the crew on season and experienced first hand the joyous and dangerous parts of being part of Sea Shepherd. He does a great job at presenting the story without strongly taking sides. It's a great book if you are interested in what's happening with whaling without someone preaching to you.I originally head about the Sea Shepherd on Animal Planet's reality show, Whale Wars, which has been following them now for five seasons. It's a fascinating show, and while I may not agree with all of their tactics I find their tenacity and idealism fascinating to watch.(review originally posted on http://daydreamsandrainydays.blogspot...)",
            "The Whale Warriors took me a long time to finish. Having read a number of books about the state of the ocean and the worldwide rapid decline in ocean life, the environmental information in The Whale Warriors was nothing new. For many readers, this book is a wake-up call and a call to action, and I'm glad that the book serves as an educational tool. For me, the book was about absorbing pain, and witnessing the work Captain Paul Watson and his amazing crew undertake to save the lives of whales. It's intensely inspiring, humbling, and awesome.For fans of the TV show, the book offers the delight of Peter Heller's excellent prose, and descriptions of seafaring life that might not make it into video soundbites.Recommended reading for anyone interested in ocean ecology, environmental activism, and the coolest vegan pirates on the planet.

And what a ghastly experience they have: inadequate weapons, below-zero temperatures, unreliable allies and hostile Bolsheviks.

            "An excellent book on the American contribution to the Allied intervention in North Russia 1918-1919.The book reads easily and quickly, has a good bibliography for further reference and provides a good balance (although not thorough) between politics surrounding the intervention and actions on the ground. This is an excellent book if you are interested in getting the quick and dirty of the expedition or if you are starting an in depth study.Halliday's narrative uses information from interviews with the actual combatants to give us an excellent view of what life was like for the common soldier, who were overwellmingly American, in the fron lines. Also, the personalities of the generals and politicians whose indecisiveness often cost these soldiers their lives. Halliday mixes both the military and politcal maneuverings skillfully giving us a balanced picture of an often ignored part of out history.Unfortunately, there are no maps in the book so you are forced to rely on the authors descriptive powers (great, but not the same as a decent map) to set the scene and understand the movements &amp, placement of units. The author also leaves out those unit designations that allow us military history nuts to track which squad belonged to which platoon, etc. (no offense to the other reviewer, I'd just like to see a bit of balance).Also, this book focuses almost exclusively on the American contingent of the intervention, with only passing references to the British side.",

            "Don't blink or you'll miss it. The arrival of a noteworthy work of historical fiction for kids tends to work one of two ways. Either the marketing machine behind the book hits bookstores and libraries full-force, cramming said book down everyone's throats until they yield and make it a bestseller/award winner... or nothing happens at all. The book slips onto shelves without so much as a squeak, never insisting that anyone go out of their way to find it. Someone Named Eva belongs firmly in the latter camp. It's small and subtle and extraordinarily good. The kind of WWII children's fiction other authors should look to emulate, given the chance.Eleven-year-old Milada remembers the night. The night when there was pounding on the door and Nazis in her Czechoslovakian home. The night when her grandmother pressed a garnet pin into her hand and told her to never forget who she was. But since that time Milada had a difficult time keeping that promise. Having been forcibly removed from her family and taken to a bizarre Nazi-run girl's school, Milada quickly learns the reason for her presence in the Lebensborn center, her shiny golden hair and bright blue eyes. Renamed Eva, Milada is part of a system intent upon turning her into a good German citizen. The kind of place where she can be taught the evils of the Jews, the glory of Hitler, and the joys of being adopted into a real German family's home. Based on events following the destruction of Lidice, Czechoslovakia, author Joan Wolf tells of the real Lebensborn center in Poland, the crimes it committed against an untold number of girls during WWII, and what it takes to stay true to your heritage.Wolf is also very good at displaying the effectiveness of intense psychological brainwashing. When Milada says that, it was hard to remember that I wasn't a Nazi, that I didn't want to be the Aryan ideal, that I hated Germany, you understand why she says this. The psychological damage inflicted on these girls must have been intense. Little wonder then that, as Wolf mentions in her Author's Note, Very little has been written in English about the Lebensborn centers that housed kidnapped children, part of which may be due to the fact that so few children were found after the war. What's more, Wolf knows how to manipulate her reader so that we find ourselves in the same position as Milada. When she realizes with a shock that she can't remember her old name, I challenge you to remember it yourself. It's gone and as she wracks her memory, we wrack our own. Such a clever technique.My mind makes me pair books together. That's just how it works. And at some point, mid-way through a read of Someone Named Eva, I realized that this book should be paired alongside The Night of the Burning: Devorah's Story by Linda Press Wulf. Both take place during WWII, and they deal with very different adoption journeys. You could create an entire reading unit out of these two books alone. It's almost as if they were made for one another, so perfectly to they complement and contrast one another's themes. Before you do that, however, you must read this book first. It's Joan M. Wolf's first book for children, and I want it to get a proper amount of attention. Books like this one don't write themselves. For a good jolt of historical fiction to the brain, Someone Named Eva may well be one of the smartest books of the year.",
            "Someone Named Eva (Joann M. Wolf)Historical Fiction. Set in WWII Germany/Czechoslovakia/Poland. Milada is a young Czech girl. She just celebrated her 11th Birthday in May of 1942. Shortly after this celebration her home is invaded by Nazi troops and her family is separated. Her father and brother are taken away, while her sister, mother &amp, grandmother are held at school. Once there the children are separated and inspected. Milada is segregated with other children, she notes the one thing in common, they all have blond hair and blue eyes. Soon Milada is put on a bus and taken away, leaving behind her beloved family.She finds herself in a training camp. Once there they are taught German and only allowed to speak this Aryan language. They are taught about Germany and how to be a Proper German Woman to follow in Hitler's plan to create a new Germany. Soon Milada is stripped of her name , identity and past...she is to be called Eva from here on. Yet inside she recalls her grandmothers words before she is take from the Nazi's....those words are: Always remember who you are, and where you came from. Her grandmother slips her a special star shaped ruby pin, this become the only tie to her past, as she desperately holds on to it over the years.A touching story of one girls plight to survive the Hitler Regime. I found this well written story to be fascinating, emotional and thought provoking. It tells of the lost small village of Lidice, Czechoslovakia, which was invaded (by Germany Under hitler's command) and ultimately destroyed. Hundreds of people were killed, taken to concentration camps, to die of starvation disease or at the brutal hands of the Nazi troops. But the main story is of the few Lidice children who were take from their home to be molded into what Hitler wanted as the Perfect German. An emotional and heart felt story, leaving a lasting memory, of the little known village and its people, whom none of which were Jewish (most people relate to WWII and Hitler's regime, not knowing that other people besides Jewish, were taken and killed). Also included at the end is a website in memorandum of those lives lost in the small but not forgotten town, Lidice Czechoslovakia.My Daughter did a book report (on Someone Named Eva) and after reading it I was compelled to read (the book) myself. I was not disappointed. And excellent read. I highly recommend to adults as well as young readers.",
            "In Someone Named Eva will follow us the fate of a little Czech girl kidnapped by the Nazis to become a little Aryan German.This novel is fictitious but drawn from a true story, during the Second World War there has indeed been the Lebensborn program which consisted in forming an Aryan population in physical traits (blue eyes, blonde hair ...) and ideologies advocated byHitler.It is the first book I read about this subject and I am very happy.The story is told with innocence and delicacy, what we can expect from a youth novel but it remains very effective for the duty of memory approached with the youngest.",
            "This quiet, obscure historical fiction novel is absolutely gutting. During World War II, many German families adopted blond, blue-eyed children from eastern Europe who had gone through Nazi reeducation to make them as German as their supposed Aryan heritage suggested that they could be. This debut children's novel imagines the fictional experience of a girl from Czechoslovakia who ended up in this situation, and the author's attention to psychological detail is extraordinarily impressive. I first learned about the concept of these adoptions when I read the back of this book at the library years ago, and even though I have learned more details since, I always picture this cover whenever the topic comes up in my reading. However, even though this book has been part of my WWII knowledge for years, I never got around to reading it until the last two nights of 2019, when I wanted something short to read before the end of the year. I'm so glad that I finally prioritized this.This novel is a little bit rough stylistically at times, since the author occasionally summarizes information that would have been better played out on the page, but it is extremely accurate to the circumstances and milieu of the time. I am amazed by how well the author recreated both obscure and familiar aspects of WWII history, and she fully demonstrated the main character's struggle to hold onto her beliefs, name, and identity through her Nazi reeducation and adoption. In the author's note, Wolf explains that since little research exists about the reeducation facilities, she had to imagine many aspects of her character's experience there. However, because she based this part of the story on sources about Nazi education, it all rang incredibly, horrifyingly true. The author never taints the novels' emotional pull through historical manipulation, and even though her unflinching portrayal of harsh details may disturb readers who are too young and sensitive to handle them, the book's content remains suitable for its target middle-grade audience. One reason why I never got around to reading this book before is because I was afraid that it wouldn't live up to its haunting premise, but I didn't need to worry. Despite its minor stylistic flaws, this book is a masterpiece of juvenile historical fiction and is one of the best World War II novels that I have ever read. Its nuance, sensitivity, solid research background, and memorable specificity all amaze me, and I highly recommend this title to older children, teens, and adults who are interested in this historical period."

The only thing Perry knew for certain was that they were bound for danger and that he must live by his wits if he were to survive serving at Drake\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s command.",

            "This is a beautiful, beautiful novel. I must admit I was a bit hesitant reading it since it's a \u201cmodern\u201d book and I'm more accustomed with classics. I also am not really familiar with Drake except with his reputation as excellent captain and renown pirate. But, I read it all the same, because I am fond of sea adventures.It's the story of Peregrine James, or called Perry James, a cook from Plymouth. After having been sentenced for stealing, he joins the Pelican, one of Drake's ship in his famous circumnavigation journey. There he becomes the least boy in the ship, but his character wins him the general's favour.Before leaving England for the sea, he meets Dr. Dee, a master of decryption and palmistry among other things, who warns Perry of the dangers that he must face in his journey. Dr. Dee only gives vague explanation on this subject, namely \u201cthe ocean of sand, the sea of silver, and the mountain of fire.\u201dAboard Drake's ship, many things are new to Perry. He must face a less capable senior, corrupt people, and stern masters. Seeing him facing all these difficulties while having a tour along the coast of Africa is quite an experience. I cannot wait to read more about him.About the book itself. I am amazed to read so many details of sea journey. Even the historical preface of the book impresses me. The author has taken so much pain to be as accurate as possible historically, and I really appreciate that. The description of the life aboard is also fascinating. I like to imagine things as I read, and this book helps me a lot in doing so.The author also strives to be balanced between the opinion of the crews regarding non-English races and also the fact about them. The description of the Moor being a good example of it. The patriotism common in that era is also portrayed satisfactorily.If you are fond of sea adventure or pirates story, or if you are fond of history in general, not mentioning a fan of Drake himself, this is a book that deserves your attention.I have also posted my review on my blog: http://half-filledattic.blogspot.com/...",
            "At Drake's Command is a fascinating Historical Fiction novel about the infamous sea captain Francis Drake. I had never read a fictional book about Drake so I was very interested to see Hill's take on Francis Drake. I think the captain and his life as well as his various expeditions are fascinating. Told from the perspective of Peregrine James, a young cook that begs to become part of Drake's command after being accused of a crime that he did not commit, this book is a fascinating look at the larger than life man that Drake was.This book takes place during a fascinating time in history. So many different countries were fighting to get their foot in the door in the new world. The country that had the most and best shipping routes would win. Some of the countries were absolutely ruthless when it came to trying to secure their place. In this book, we get to see many of the different people that Drake and his men encounter. Some of them, like the Moors in Africa, are quite different. It was really interesting to see the different interactions between the various groups. Obviously with so much competition going on during that time period, a lot of the encounters are wrought with extreme tension and scheming. You get a good taste of what it must have been like to be under someone like Drake.I loved that this book was told from the perspective of Peregrine James (he was a fictional character in case you were wondering). By seeing the story through someone who had a lot of face to face time with Drake himself, you get a good sense of what the man must have been like. I also just liked James' character. He is young but he seems to be very self-assured most of the time.There is a lot of good historical detail in this book. You can feel the sea breezes, taste James' meals, and feel the roughness of London at the time. This book has a very abrupt ending but there is promise of a sequel!Bottom line: A good historical read about a fascinating man!",
            "One of my favorite historical characters was Sir Francis Drake. David Wesley Hill, in his book At Drake\u2019s Command, has captured the spirit of adventure to sail under Drake\u2019s command at sea. This is an excellent historical fiction with plenty of action and adventure.The storyline is based loosely on the actual records of Drake\u2019s voyages and this adds to the realism of the story. The story is well defined and easy to follow. The various twist and turns in story make the adventure more exciting. I found it very easy to put myself in the story as an unseen extra.Our hero in the story is fictitious but it makes it easier to identify with him. David Wesley Hill did an excellent job of character development with each character. They each seemed real and it was easy to follow and identify with them. Their emotions and moral character came through.I really enjoyed At Drake\u2019s Command by David Wesley Hill. I highly recommend this book to all readers. Please note: I was given a free copy of this book in exchange for my honest review.",
            "So as a fan of historical fiction i was searching for a juicy story that would pull me into the world of one of history most famous commanders, Sir Francis Drake. I wanted something modern and not bound by details of names and dates or too long winded on old writings.. This book is perfect for anyone who likes adventure story's that bring you into the old world in a fun, funny, ride along way. Characters are written very well and you get to know the crew in a familiar way. The places and details about the shipping are great. The day to day life and banter of the characters is interesting and puts you there. Reads well, gets the imagination firing and suitable for teenagers and above. I recommend this book to anyone who likes historical fiction or just a good old story about a boy embarking on an adventure into a exotic mad world :)  ",
            "Being the author of At Drake's Command, I am, of course, biased as to its qualities. However, I believe I can safely assure you that it's an entertaining story and a book well worth reading.",
            "Can hardly wait to get the book, I read the excerpt, and as usual it stops at an exciting moment! Just finished reading the book!!!! Very suspenseful ending. I can hardly wait for the next book"

            "This is va collection of tales written by travellers throughout history. Accounts start from BC to around the 1950's-70's. Some are very entertaining, some are moving, and some are very poetic. There were a few I had to skip over because they were written when people wrote English how they spoke. It was too hard to read. Others I had to skip over because they were written by Christian missionaries or Spanish explorers and were very prejudiced. But the majority of the tales are excellent and give you a different perspective than the what is said in travel books. I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in the world outside their windows. ",
            "This is a remarkable bit of scholarship. Newby presents brief biographical notes about hundreds of travellers writing during the last few millennia, including all the ones you can think of and many more of whom you have never heard. That alone is worth the read - but he also includes rather brief excerpts from their writings. Some of these are highly entertaining or interesting, others suffer (it seems to me) from being out of context."

You get taught how to compare them with respect to a property of choice.The book is full of charming humour and many quotations. A beginner-friendly appendix provides pretty much all the mathematics you are going to need to make your way through the book, the author has written the appendix in order to make the book friendly for people who wish to use the mathematical results in their study of analysis of algorithms, not about the details of the mathematical theory being used - as it should be.This book really is unique, and I believe it is out of print.

Cue thrills and chills and creepy crawlies as Erin and Marty end up with more than they bargained for, as the ride starts to feel a little bit too real. This Goosebumps actually had quite a bit going for it. Distinctly unique from the previous books I've read so far, it uses the film industry and costumes to add that extra layer of doubt to the story. You're never quite sure if everything is real or just an elaborate disguise or robot. The pacing is also pretty good, and has a plot that for the most part makes sense. The ending is very abrupt however, and still sways towards the ridiculous. All in all, probably the best story in the series so far with an air of the nostalgic, classic goosebumps atmosphere I've been expecting (yet not getting) with these stories so far. ",

I didn't want to think about the frightening creatures we had run into - or the close calls Marty and I had had.I didn't want to think.Excellent. We're back on track. This is a great Goosebumps novel.Erin and Marty are best friends - 12 years old and so similar-looking they are often mistaken for twins. But they are similar in more than appearance! They both love horror movies, and always go to the latest one together. Erin is lucky that her dad is a theme park engineer, he often gets her tickets to advance showings.And Erin's dad has great news! He has completed a Shocker Street theme park. Shocker Street is a series of horror movies that Erin and Marty love. There are six so far, starring the dubiously named creatures like Ape Face, the Toxic Creep, Shockro, and Captain Sick. (Among others. o.O) Anyway, Erin's father says Marty and Erin can be the first ones to go through the park (on an automated tram). They can be the test subjects for his first run-through. The kids are so excited! This is a dream come true!Only when they take the tour, it seems a little too real. A little too creepy. Those costumes the actors are wearing are surprisingly realistic. Warned time and time again never to leave the tram, the kids run into certain ... bugs in the system....Wow, Stine is back in full-force here! I really enjoyed this book. Also, Stine delivers some excellent and surprising twists! The ending was a real shocker! LOL No complaints here, this is what Goosebumps should be - fun, scary, and with a surprise ending that knocks your socks off! Highly recommended for any kid.First, you slowly come to realize that the creatures are all real. Erin and Marty have some pretty narrow escapes. Finally, they run into a director, who informs them that it is just a film set. They were being filmed for a movie. Okay, that's the twist.LOL No, it isn't. The director tells the kids to go into Shockro's house - Erin's dad is waiting there. Marty starts running for it. Erin is worried - in the films, anyone who enters Shockro's house is slammed with 20,000 volts! But the man laughs and says that's just in the movies. And starts to walk away. It's only then that Erin realizes he has a power cord running out of his back. He's a robot! Erin screams out for Marty to stop running - but it's too late. Electricity courses through his body and he falls to the ground. As she kneels, sobbing over his body, her dad approaches her. But is it really her Dad? NO! She starts screaming in fright! Her words start to become incoherent babble!Aaaannnnnnndddddd.... She's a robot! Actually, so was Marty. That's not her dad, it's her creator. She's malfunctioning. Wow. Great ending twists! All four of them. So fun.Tl,dr - So. That was amazingly fun. I'm so glad to see that Stine hasn't completely lost his touch - I was getting worried. Very enjoyable. Great twist ending.",

            "Mosque by David Macaulay is a nonfiction book that is intended for the intermediate to advance age group. This book is about how a mosque was constructed during the sixteenth century. This book shows diagrams of the construction as well as showing the reader the importance of a mosque in the culture. I rate this book with five stars based on the information and illustrations. I loved how this book had pages filled with diagrams of the materials that was used to construct the mosque as well as what the mosque inside was used for. I loved that the illustrations that accompany the story was colorful and let the reader into the text. I am always wary of nonfiction books because I feel that they are sometimes too boring with so much text that I get lost in what they are saying. I loved how the book had so many illustrations and diagrams that would break up the text into smaller chunks to process. I loved how the author really put so much information about the Islamic culture that I could really start to understand the creation of the Mosque and the beauty of it. In the book, I could see the balconies, the bath house and all of the fantastic Islamic Art. The Mosque was created in such a mathematical way that it was fantastic that back in the sixteenth century there was so much knowledge of architect and mathematics engineering. Children will love to read this book and especially the children that are geared towards building things and mathematics. This book is a great way to also study the Islamic religion and see how important their religious building was to the community of Muslims. We see how the building of the Mosque incorporated everything that they believed. ",
            "This is a nonfiction book that describes the building of a mosque in the sixteenth century. This book contains facts about how the mosque was built, what materials were used, and what religious values this structure held for the people who followed it. This book is informational in more than one way. The focus is on architectural structures but the book can also teach readers a little about the people that built the mosque, what their beliefs were and what this structure meant for them. This book contains a lot of facts but they do not empower the book or overwhelm the reader. In fact, the illustrations in the book really add to the facts contained inside and help create a mental picture of the time and place. ",
            "The book starts off with the building of a certain Mosque, in a certain place. It says how it's built, how it's designed, and how they celebrate when it's done. I give this book three stars because it could have been more interesting. The book gives a good amount of detail, but they could have gone into more detail about the detail.I suggest this book for kids who are older than 7 because it needs a lot of understanding and patience for the reader. The graphics are extremely detailed and done in water color. In each page there is about 1-2 painted pictures.The book contains 2-3 paragraphs made of 5 sentences in each page. I enjoyed the paintings on the side which helped you imagine it better. I liked this book because it opens a window into the art of ancient buildings.",
            "Macaulay describes the means by which a Mosque is funded, designed, sited, and then built in the 16th century. As with all of Macaulay's books, the text is accompanied by wonderful drawings. This one was a bit different from which others because a Mosque, unlike other Macaulay topics, is not so complex in its physical building. But it was wonderful to learn about all the different parts of a faith not particularly familiar to me.",
            "Macaulay breaks down the process of creating a 16th century mosque in beautifully detailed illustrations and explanations. I wish I had this book with me when I visited Istanbul! Seeing these structures were awe-inspiring, but understanding the complexity of the foundation and interior layers adds a whole new dimension to appreciating the effort that went into the making of these gorgeous buildings. ",
            "Beautiful, detailed illustrations and very informative text. I really loved learning how they made the domes on mosques. As usual, I think Macaulay's text is too lengthy, but I guess it depends on who's reading the book. Really neat book!",
            "Interesting fact: this book actually taught me better on understanding the structure technics used for the old mosques THAN they taught me at the architecture school. My restoration professor advised me to read it. "

            "Characters? Fantastic. Representation of court intrigue? Masterful. Random misprint leaving out several paragraphs explaining how the heroine got from trying to put off her unwanted beau to her father's offices? Not so great. A few other typos decreased my respect for the book. ",
            "This book seemed to be about a woman trying to leave a \u201cwoman\u2019s place\u201d 100s of years before it was at all acceptable. It is also supposed to be historical fiction during Elizabeth Tudors time. This book was a cheesy romance light disguised as historical fiction. The author threw in just enough details about the Tudors, and England, to claim it as such. However, she could have written the same love story during any reign - even in a fictional world without naming the queen. It really isn\u2019t very historically accurate in my opinion. The ending was rushed. I didn\u2019t go into it hoping or wanting a predictable love story. ",

When I picked up Jeane Westin\u2019s The Spymaster\u2019s Daughter, I was immediately drawn to the period it was written in. I adore reading about Tudor England, especially ones of Elizabeth I. Westin\u2019s promise of intrigue and mystery definitely lured my interest, and I couldn\u2019t wait to start reading.Lady Frances Sidney is the daughter of Sir Francis Walsingham, the queen\u2019s spymaster. Lady Frances takes after her father and is a smart, tenacious, and courageous woman. Unfortunately in this time period, ladies belong in the court, serving the queen, or at home with a husband. Definitely is there no room for ladies of the court to be a spymaster. But Lady Frances refuses what is destined of her. Impressed by Lady Frances\u2019 spirit, Queen Elizabeth gives her a chance to prove herself. She begins secret work, training under her father\u2019s decoders, momentarily living the life of a spymaster. What Lady Frances doesn\u2019t expect is risking her father\u2019s condemnation, her heart\u2019s longing, and her own life to do what is right.Lady Frances is an interesting character. She is definitely tenacious and courageous, but at times I felt she was too head strong for her own good. I could only begin to understand what life was like back then, but Westin did a good job putting a Lady\u2019s life at court into perspective. I adored Lady Frances. I loved how she went for what she believed in, but within reason. I enjoyed her adventures and day-to-day events. But there were times when her actions and I didn\u2019t get along. I feel that I don\u2019t understand or grasp the time period enough to respect some of those actions.Westin\u2019s secondary and supporting cast was well placed throughout the story. Each character had an obvious reason for being placed where they were. Some I loved, and others I didn\u2019t. Pauley was one that I wasn\u2019t sure about.

In a few areas of the book, I felt that there was too much information, and other times I wanted more. There are little bits and pieces that I found odd, but again, this is mostly due to my personal preferences.Overall, I enjoyed many aspects of The Spymaster\u2019s Daughter.

            "Not my favourite. I liked the concept enough to keep pushing through hoping it would get better. There were parts of the story I really enjoyed, but it was overshadowed by my annoyance with the writing style or the main character.The writing felt disjointed. I'm fairly certain there was a whole transition completely skipped over at one point - I must have read those couple pages five times trying to figure out when the scene had changed, but finally just accepted it and moved on. Other times, it seemed as though the author thought oh, I forgot to tell them xyz! and just stuck it in haphazardly. I didn't think having Lady Rich present so much added to the story at all - knowing she existed is fine as a plot point, but there was no reason to keep bringing her into things. It felt forced, like the author was saying Hey, I think you've forgotten her. DON'T FORGET HER. Okay, now carry on, I'll remind you again in 20 pages.My annoyance with the main character is my own fault. I really wanted her personality to be more defiant. I really wanted to root for her, but the simple fact that she was so set in her social station annoyed me - I want my heroes to be the ones who don't need the maids and grooms, to break the demure lady quality more often than twice in a book, to circumvent the patriarchy and go after their own dreams. I knew going in that this was historical fiction, and I knew that none of those things would be the case, yet I still got annoyed with her. Frequently. Oh, and I prefer my heroines to be motivated by something other than romance. I mean, she was, but that subplot was unnecessary. I wanted more about her stealing books and teaching herself spy tasks and sneaking along on missions."

            "He never knew what hit him. The first line in this book was enough to hook me. How could I not love a heroine who was smart and resourceful enough to drop the hero to the ground in the middle of a battle?Baron Royce is Norman and Lady Nicholaa is Saxon, and that makes them enemies in 1066. The Prize starts with Nicholaa trying to defend her home against Royce and his barbaric soldiers. She's successfully defeated the three previous knights sent by the bastard William of Normandy, soon to be the new King of England, but she realizes Royce is on a league of his own and the chances of her winning against him are nonexistent. So she tricks him into thinking she's her twin sister Danielle - a nun! - and manages to escape and find sanctuary in the nearest convent. When Royce finds out that there's no sister Danielle and that he's been had by the cunning Nicholaa, he can't help but appreciate how clever she is and surprises his men by laughing instead of getting furious with her deception.Arrogant that he is, Royce doesn't see Nicholaa's escape as a defeat, as he's sure he'll be able to leave her sanctuary and go with him to meet his King William in London. As the Saxon woman who's so valiantly defended her family's holding, she's a legend among the Normans, the bride the King is going to give to his most worthy knight as the prize in a contest for her hand - and her family's holding and lands, of course. As it happens, Royce does get Nicholaa to leave her sanctuary and go with him to London, even though she keeps trying to escape every chance she gets along the way. During this journey, they start seeing each other with new eyes, and Royce grows more and more attracted to Nicholaa while she realizes how honorable, caring and protective he is. And that's how they start to fall in love with each other, against their better judgment. Naturally, they still have a long way to understand and accept their feelings, and that's where the fun lies. :)I liked Royce from the start, and he won me when he laughed - instead of going ballistic - at being bested by Nicholaa with her nun act. He was arrogant, hard and a bit gruff on the outside, but soft and oh-so-sweet on the inside. He was like a delicious petit g\u00e2teau, my favorite dessert, and all I can say is, Yummy, may I have some more, please? ,) He was smart and brave, but didn't think he was worthy of Nicholaa because she was a beautiful and gentle lady while he was just an ugly - his face was marred by a horrible scar - and hardened warrior. But she never saw him that way and, incredibly, she even thought his handsomeness was disturbing. Ah, love is blind, indeed! Nicholaa was a strong and cunning heroine. She was a bit ditzy and naive sometimes - her convoluted plan to get Royce drunk with ale backfired big time, LOL - but that came across as charming and not annoying. She also seemed unable to stop herself from telling lies - all for the greater good, of course - but she couldn't keep them straight to save her life and Royce had no problem seeing through them. The way he kept cornering and trapping her inside her lies had me laughing out loud every single time.And Royce's lectures... I loved those scenes. The man loved to lecture Nicholaa, even though he was aware she didn't pay any attention to it. I had a smile on my face every time he clasped his hands behind his back, started lecturing her and she just sat there with her hands folded on her lap, daydreaming the whole time. That was just one example of the many interactions between Royce and Nicholaa that were just a joy to read, and I couldn't get enough of them.The only thing that I found a bit jarring was the lack of closure in regards to Nicholaa's older brother Thurston. That wasn't bad enough to make me enjoy this book any less, it's just that I wanted to know what happened to him.All in all, what's left for me to say? Another Garwood, another winner! At this point, I'm a truly devoted fan of Ms. Garwood. I haven't gone through all her backlist yet, but I really loved everything I've read so far. Having read her books almost back to back, it was easy for me to notice that her stories have some kind of a formula, but it's one I love so I'm all for it. Very well done, Ms. Garwood!",
            "My favourite re-read/listens...I kind of love that a romance set so far back in history, still manages to have a heroine that shows strength, courage and perseverance. This mixed with a slight vulnerability, made Nicholaa one of my very favourite heroines. Royce, well he's exactly my kind of man. Strong, determined and fierce, he finds it hard to accept the sweetness Nicholaa gives him. They are so perfect together that each re-read leaves me a very happy and content romance reader.Julie Garwood, you are a bloody legend.I'm on a roll...maybe one more Julie Garwood ... until next year. ,-)**********Beauty is in the eye of the beholderAnother awesome Julie Garwood historical romance done and dusted. I'm loving re-reading/listening to these classics. In The Prize, we meet the beautiful and feisty Nicholaa and the scarred warrior Royce. Their love story was full of humour, sizzling chemistry, intrigue and treachery. While at first, it seems they are destined for a marriage filled with battles. As they go on, their attraction to each other intensifies and feelings develop. Nicholaa loves her family and will do anything to protect them. Royce is determined to have a peaceful life...if only Nicholaa would obey his rules.The Prize captivated my attention so much I was in danger of heading out to Woop Woop instead of work. It's too easy to relax on the train listening to my audio and forget that I actually have a set destination to reach. Again, I loved the narrator and had no problems telling when the characters changed. I will definitely be listening to more Julie Garwood in the future.",
            "Once again, Julie Garwood delivers a heartwarming, humorous, and delightfully romantic tale. xa0What I liked most about this book was Royce's character (he's not one Garwood's prototypical hero) and the relationship between him and the heroine, Nicholla.xa0Royce is a hero to adore. He may not be extremely good-looking, with a badly scarred face, but he has the perfect combination of alpha and beta characteristics. He's powerful, driven, and a true leader, but he also possess a strong benevolent side that makes him one of the most charming, endearing, and truly swoon worthy heroes Julie Garwood has created.Royce's and Nicholla's relationship is fabulous. Bothxa0characters are open, honest, and even blunt about their feelings (once they recognized them, of course). It was refreshing not to have all the added drama and misunderstandings that comes from a lack of communication. xa0 xa0 xa0 xa0 xa0 xa0I also enjoyed the subplot involving Nicholla's brother Justin. His story enriched the plot and brought to the book some of it more endearingxa0moments.xa0The Prize is a wonderful,xa0feel-good romance you'll be happy to have read. You can't beat Julie Garwood. She's one of the best! ",
            "2. Reading it. It's good. perfect. perfect. 1. READING.The best historical I have ever studied from the Best Historical, this book from the romances I read! I claim. unique, extraordinary, tremendous bi thing !!! real life against boorish men I've got a much sympathy, such H\ufffdder saying stop it, but you stop you and you therefore place hit by FLN ahhhhhhh.kitap full b\ufffdyle.garwood In historical truly separate. Although I don't like to read the British Dukes even, I even love them, I don't even count Scots. Yes I have read a lot of books on the old time battles but no one (except KMM) is up to the Garwood, this briteness-in love line does not draw well. Because they can't sufficiently write the mans of the man in love, either they are late in love words, either stirning with the hydumacy or in love, they cannot maintain the setting between lusty. THIS. WOMAN. Mu.mel! Year 1066, the Year of Normanlar's UK. Normanlar Gal-Viking Mix of Warriors. So a class A but plusplus: D bi times the man is in any bi case, while you're worried, while I'm worried, this makes the plusplusplus. Because I have read this as a fabulous man, it was long, I'm done so I have read very good characters but it is experienced even for a man's dream like Royce! He was wondering what he was on Royce Nicholaa.Nicholaa was placing himself in the heart of Royce and Royce didn't have any weapons that could stop him. Shit, Royce's life was in a pattern and he was too old to change. He also liked the layout of daily uniformity and discipline. He was very pleased with his life.Mem of my first exertions: First transmitting: DO NAMIN ROYCE woke up in cold sweats. He was very convincing and very realist. Dream in Nicholaa was lost in a forest. He was at the great danger and he couldn't have access to Royce.O Sensual, look in the dream that the man saw instead of wet dreams, and I had a tiny billet in Royce's hand. In the light of trembling candle, Nicholaa was able to see the white on the table in front of Royce. The Royce stump was holding on the bottom of its left hand in the left hand. In the afterlife, he sheds a small knife and the splinters at the top of the log carving with him. After looking at the deputies of the passage, he was back to the log. He was doing another black veside to Royce Nicholaa.Nicholaa he realized that the whole cuts come from. She also understood that her husband seems to be depleted in this. But more than all, he understood anything else: Royce loved her. In order to show her feelings that he can't understand what is the fucker and to make it happy ... You are probably not very impressed by the adfafd, but the following rows are tremendous places. female character Nicholaa is sometimes freaked out because of his jaw, as in Royce, as in Royce, as in Royce, as it is Royce, I will take the books of this woman in your own language (the characters decompact in English because it is the HE-SHE event in English As we didn't have the translation, there were always names, there was a continuous name, it was an estimate but if I don't even take those who get out of Epsilon, I will prepare the carton skin and cover them. That's what it is too.",
            "MY FAVOURITE HISTORICAL!!!!! CHECKMATENicolaa (a saxon)has defended her home against the normans and the king is not happy.The king has ordered Baron Royce to bring the woman that had defended her home so well against his vassals. She was going to be The Prize for the lucky knight who won the battle for her. The King was allowing his knights to compete for her hand in marriage. But, Nicholaa saved the Queens niece. So the king changed his mind and allowed Nicholaa to choose from any of the single knights. Of course since she had already spent a week or so with Royce she choose's him because she knew he would not hurt her. They get married and sparks fly.Omg, where to begin with Royce!!! Iloved him, he is everything a hero should be big, brave,sexy,handsome (even with a scar)and has a wicked sense of humour. Both Nicolaa and Royce are believable ,lovable characters.If you love a great story with a great H/H then Please please read, you won't be disappointed. JG at her very best.",
            "Before starting this book you may want to mentally prepare yourself for a kowtowing heroine because if that kind of trait bugs you (like it does me to no end) this book has the potential to get on your nerves \u2013fast. There\u2019s that and the fact that the hero is painfully overbearing and you think he\u2019s going to get the oh so deserved whack upside the head eventually but he never does unfortunately which is a shame because it could have done him a world of good :)Briefly, the story is about Nicolaa (no that\u2019s not a typo there really are two \u201ca\u201ds in her name), a Saxon, who ends up being taken as chattel by Royce, the Norman, in the name of William the Conqueror. She\u2019s forced to marry a Norman (she hates them all of course) and live happily ever after. She decides to hitch her wagon with Royce \u2013a kind of better the devil you know and all that. Up to there the story is pretty good. Got the ol\u2019 love/hate thing going, some decent tension building, story is moving along nicely, basically all the things you need to keep you interested and reading. Once the two tie the knot and go about the business of living together however it\u2019s downhill to the end and I was tired of them. I love a good medieval but this wasn\u2019t one of them.Now the novel starts out well enough with a strong heroine who\u2019ll give you the what for but she quickly spirals into the nauseatingly acquiescing \u201cI have to please my husband at all cost even if he\u2019s an idiot and what he says makes no sense\u201d kind of heroine :-/ You might think it\u2019s all part of her plan to get him later, but it\u2019s not, and there\u2019s no plan and she\u2019s just another one of \u201cthose\u201d heroines that make your skin crawl with their suddenly submissive character that has the reader shaking her head thinking \u201cwhat the **bleep bleep** happened here?!\u201d. Who likes this kind of woman anyway? I hate when the author sets up a heroine to be strong and independent and then does this 180 on you making her nearly spineless. What a rip off. She doesn\u2019t have to be an uncompromising harpy but she doesn\u2019t have to be an accommodating doormat 24/7 either. Thankfully Garwood didn\u2019t make Nicolaa TSTL, but she's waaay too nice and that kind of heroine is just plain boring and one dimensional. As for the hero, if you liked the overbearing moron in Garwood\u2019s The Bride (I hated him) then this is a moderately toned down version of Mr I Need a Punch in My Smug Face. Our man Royce here isn\u2019t that much different. He\u2019s such a jerk sometimes. He could be really nice and protective but then he goes into I Know Everything Always mode and it just grates on the nerves. He\u2019s overly bossy and condescending like the annoying dad in the father knows best role instead of being the sexy lover that he should be. I don\u2019t know why authors write these guys like that but this book was written in the early \u201890s and maybe that was the trend for hero writing. Mind you, if an author can make you dislike a character it\u2019s better than being ambivalent so somewhere they must have written something well to get at least a reaction out of you, good or bad. I\u2019d prefer the good though\u2026 anyway, moving on\u2026In terms of writing there\u2019s a problem with paragraphing. When an author changes a scene but not a chapter, normally there are a few blank lines between paragraphs to indicate this change to the reader, this wasn\u2019t the case here and it makes it hard to follow the story because you feel like you misread something. The writing is also more of a telling than a showing kind of style which I don\u2019t particularly enjoy. It tends to make for a flat story that never really comes alive. Better be a fan of heavy narration seeing as there's enough of it.This is no Ransom that\u2019s for sure but it\u2019s not as irritating as Honor's Splendour either, I guess it\u2019s sort of in between the two. It\u2019s not that there\u2019s anything really wrong with the novel it\u2019s more that I don\u2019t like these kinds of characters or this kind of writing. Here\u2019s hoping that the next Garwood book I pick up leans more towards the Ransom side because that book was exceptional, nothing like this borderline nails on the chalkboard one. "

            "This is a fantastic introduction to the world of plant spirits and healing. Elliot's candid and straight forward style is pleasant and informative. His deep sense of reverence, humility and wisdom easily draw the reader into this world of healing and magic without a whole lot of flake or bullshit. This book was recommended through the reading list of a Shaman that I work with. Elliot also says some really important things about contemporary masculinity (and the inherent masculinity within each of us) and a deep need for healing and harmony. There were a number of very sharp and insightful gems of wisdom and insight that I happily carried forward. I would really like to study with him when he winds his way back to Ontario. I give it a hearty two thumbs up!",
            "The writing style is like Carlos Castaneda's annoying dialogue rambling between a student and a teacher. It's a mesh mash of the Chinese 5 elements, a bit about the plants, and other irrelevant topics. The last three interview at the end of the book made it enjoyable.The author should have just written this as an article and moved on. But writes a book on his education from the Amazonians that plants and nature have Spirits and are people! My God...seriously? It makes me wonder where did some white people grow up to believe nature is dead and inert.The following are quotes from the Amazon people (not the author):There is only one active ingredient in planet medicines--friendship. (Friendship between the plant spirit and the patient)...plants have spirit, and that spirit is the strongest medicine. Spirits can heal the deepest reaches of the heart and soulas the plantain spirit told me, they plants can do nothing unless they are askedHe was describing a certain aspect of the human condition. He was emphasizing the eyes, telling me that the eyes of a person are the key to understanding them, as well as a clue to how much protection I need for myself I couldn't understand who he was unless I could see and sense the spirits around him that were affecting him. Unless we know what powers are affecting a man, we can't really know who that man is",
            "Oddly, I enjoyed this book for it's deep message about the spirit of plants and how they/we understand their help and the possibilities of what their gifts are to us. It's a bit far out there but very, very interesting. When Eliot talks about the different planes in his visions/dreams it reminds me greatly of the Eckankar religion... of many heavens. Quantum physicists are just now exploring different dimensions in a way that makes the concept much more thoughtful and potentially possible... so who knows!"

Who knew?!One of the many things that I am taking away from this book is that when it comes to plant spirit medicine, there are no hard and fast rules about how to go about communicating with the spirits, but rather to just be with the plants and ask them what to do.Eliot Cowan also addresses the inner conversation that many of us have that could possibly hinder one's growth in our healing practices, where we might have received direction from the spirit, but our inner dialogue wonders how we know, and begin thinking this will sound crazy, thinking like that. He says to ask the plant, be ready to receive the answer in any way it may show up, and then test it ourselves. It's what I thought on my own, but just the validation that this idea was good is helpful for me. I really liked the fact that one doesn't need fancy rituals, fancy tools, or even the ability to call the plants by the scientific names we've given them. They have their own names.The ways each shaman or healer receives his power is different just like the way they may use the plants - even the same plant may be used in many different ways, sometimes in a way that contradicts the scientific understanding of the chemical constituents and what science sees as relevant. And because of this, these healers have tremendous ability to heal in a way that baffles many scientists. The whole subject is contrary to most typical thought, especially western thought.As a Reiki practictioner for over a decade and a student of herbal studies for most of my life, this book just resonates with me on so many levels of understanding.I think if you're wanting to learn more about plant spirits, this is a great book. Likewise, if you have a fascination for herbs, plant healing, and other modalities of alternative healing, this could be a fantastic option for you.",
            "Exquisite. Just what I needed to hear at the moment. Beautiful stories and a beautiful connection to the world of plants. Absolutely joyous!My edition had a different cover, and was apparently a second edition.",
            "Not for the closeminded. Highly recommend it.",
            "This is a well-written, beautiful book full of wisdom and stories.",
            "This is a very interesting book in that it goes farther into the consciousness or the SPIRIT of the Plant Kingdom. Where Secret Life of Plants explores the level of consciousness of Plants Eliot Cowan goes farther and works with the SPIRIT of the Plants.The author in his healing work will call upon on Spirit of the Plant to heal his clients. His clients are not to use any physical part of the plant in their healing. I find the author's work as a very important component to understanding that everything in our physical world has a Spirit or Consciousness associated with it, or it would not exist here in the physical.A very enlightening book!",
            "One of the best books I've read in a long time. It's not fiction but it reads like a story, and I could hardly put it down. I learned so much about the 5 elements among other things. The author has developed a relationship with plants that is shamanic, and is able to enlist the help of the spirits of plants to help people, and the experiences he has with them and his patients is just incredible. I want to learn. Also, right after reading it I had quite an interesting dream that I felt to be coming from plants. ",
            "An excellent window to peer into working with plant spirit for healing as well as shamanic practices and interviews with shamans of great renoun to drink up even more knowledge and insight. Pulling from his personal experience, acupuncturists and Huichol Native Americans, this book is short and sweet, a perfect tool for the plant medicine advocate, and adds an expanded perspective while read alongside Braiding Sweetgrass by Robin Wall Kimmerer, I give this book 5 stars."

            "With the ninth book in this series, you can absolutely tell the difference of who wrote these books. The first 8 were written by a writers tandem, and they used the Joan of Arc sword extensively in their story line. Now, with this book, it was secondary to the story between Annja and Kennichi Owaga and his search for a family heirlom that has been missing for centuries. I found this book tedious and boring at times, and the ending was as expected. The only interesting part was Annya's inability to pull the sword when she thought she was in danger. I, of course, could have done without seeing Garin in the story. I definitely want to see an end to his constant interferrence in Annya's life. Others, however, might disagree with me, and that is truly ok. His appearance in this book wasn't necessary to the grand scheme of the story. The vayra was the story. Those chasing Ken and Annya was the story. I would seriously love to know who actually wrote this particular book, and tell them to read the first 8 again, before continuning the series. However, that is not likely as we are now into 30 books of this series.",
            "You can definitely tell that this story was done by a new author. I'm not saying that it was bad, it was just totally different than any of the other Rogue Angel books. There was a lot more talking in this one and a lot less action. I liked it personally because you got to see Annja as more of a person with feelings and emotions instead of a hard ass. I like Ken and I wish that Annja could have a relationship with someone other than Garin and Roux. Garin was in this one but he was a complete ass like usual. I liked the setting of Japan it was very interesting to learn about some of their cultures especially about the ninjas. All in all a good installment that will leave you wanting to read the next one. ",
            "Starting off, let me say that I am a big fan of this series and was deeply disappointed when Gold Eagle discontinued it. Having read a lot of the later books, I'm going back and reading the earlier entries, most of them for the first time. That established, I was a little disappointed by Warrior Spirit, but nothing I can really put my finger on.The story is pretty straightforward. Annja meets a Japanese gentleman named Kenneth and not entirely by accident on his part. Turns out Kenneth is a ninja and he needs Annja's help in retrieving a centuries old object that is rumored to possess incredible powers. Naturally there is another party that seeks the object for nefarious means and the Yakuza is also involved.The entire book takes place in Japan, where Annja is vacationing, and there is plenty of action, including a squad of Japanese schoolgirls turned hit persons (to be politically correct). I did go through the book rather quickly. But for some reason it just didn't have the same magic as most of the other Rogue Angel novels. But it is recommended for someone who likes the series or just wants a quick diversion between other endeavours.",
            "Warrior Spirit (Rogue Angel, #9) by Alex Archer Jon MerzLooking into Japanese mythology Annja Creed finds adventure looking for a magical treasure. She gets to learn new skills, find new partners, and learns that she is not alone with the responsibility that she has been challenged with. Jon Merz has only one glitch with me, he proposes a toast in a foreign language and never translates it. It gets frustrating not knowing what they are saying, enough that i asked other readers of the book if i missed something. I recommend the series but more based on the remarkable versions by Victor Milan, but if you want more, go for all the books.",
            "Another great book in the series. I love all the action and adventure. I look forward to reading all of these books. Each one so far has its own story with interesting characters. I like the history of each artifact and how each character deals with how to use the power."

            "If I may be so bold, I\u2019d like to begin at the end and say there\u2019s definitely a \u201cdisturbance in the creative force.\u201d\u2014thanks Amanda Or at least that was my first thought after completing this novel.If I didn\u2019t want to embrace books with a warm hug and proceed to shove them out into the world by talking about them, promoting them, and engaging in lively discussions with informed readers across the space and time continuum for the rest of my life without fail, I could very easily just write ALEX off and move on with my life, rubbing my palms together, and then ducking under an overpass while the train rocks the tracks above my head. But that wouldn\u2019t be okay, and it certainly isn\u2019t a productive use of my time. Maybe I\u2019m half-sensitive, half-crazy, prone to second-guessing, and have enough of an ego that I feel like I need to somehow be a productive member of society and make some sort of contribution before I dissipate off this Earth faster than a fart in the New Mexican wind, so here we are, wonderful reader and I, dancing the tango over yet another book review. Where I hope to impart a few thoughts, informed opinions, and constructive criticisms, and you can pretend that you actually give a flying fart.Here are a few of the issues:Constant telling to the point that I wanted to rip my hair out? Check.Inside Alex\u2019s head way too much, to the point that I could set up camp, read a newspaper, and smoke a cigarette while balancing a tumbler on my left knee? Check.Shaggy dialogue? Check.Exclamation point minefields? Check.Not getting to the point? Check.Am I making myself clear? No.Piss-poor similes and metaphors? Check.Overstated, redundant, bloated prose? Check.Stilted, stiff, wooden, overformal, mannered, and pretentious dialogue? Check.Overemphasis on ellipses? Check.Repetitious to the point that I thought I had developed CRS disease? Check.Drama and heightened tension sucked out of the prose faster than a Hoover by mediocre writing? Check.Excessive stammering to the point that I wanted to offer speech lessons? Check.Mystery? Possibly but it was a side car on this happy train.A supposed thriller minus most of the thrills? Check.Plenty of clich\u00e9s? Check.Immediate and unexplained epiphanies? Check.Brings words like pussyfooting to the foray? Check.Penchant for passive voice? Check.Almost seemed to switch POV in the middle of a few scenes? Check.Editing comments that were both annoying and frustrating and over explained the difference between French and English? Check. (This should be fixed upon the official release, otherwise readers are in for a real treat.)For the first two-thirds or so of this tale, Alex Prevost just might have been my least favorite character of all time. I\u2019m not sure I could have looked at her, or even been in the same room with her, and being in her head for so long proved rather torturous, corrupting me on more than one level. But once I did understand the motivations for her actions, she did grow on me however slightly, even though it was probably a bit too late in the game for me to come full circle in my way of thinking. And the ending itself proved a bit farfetched even for this roller-coaster-induced tale. If I didn\u2019t already have some sort of complex where I tend to question myself, ponder the meaning of life, and seek out both the good in people and books, I might be perfectly fine with writing two one-star reviews in a row. But I can\u2019t help but feel as though I have somehow failed the universe.Upon finishing ALEX, I don\u2019t really feel anger or frustration or fury or annoyance, I feel a lingering, profound sadness that hangs over me like the sun, a sense of defeat and loss and despair that clings to me like a wet t-shirt, and then I don\u2019t really feel much of anything at all.I received this book for free through NetGalley.Cross-posted at Robert's Reads",

            " 4.5 Stars Wow! Dark, disturbing, tense, but utterly compelling. Not for the faint hearted. A crime / thriller novel that is a gripping page turner full of shocks and surprises.  French Author, Pierre Lemaitre\u2019s second novel Alex really grabbed me from the very first page and I just couldn't put this one down. It\u2019s translation from French by Frank Wyhnne is brilliantly done.  Alex is running out of time.......Kidnapped, beaten, suspended from the ceiling of an abandoned warehouse in wooden cage. Alex Prevost is in no position to bargain, her abductor\u2019s only desire is to watch her die. Apart from a shaky police report, Commandant Camille verhoeven has nothing to go on, no suspect, no leads. If he is to find Alex her is have to get inside her head.I was on the edge of my seat, I actually exclaimed out loud and pulled a lot of faces reading this one and that is what a good thriller is for me. While it\u2019s disturbing and quite shocking it isn\u2019t too graphic or gory which suited me perfectly but if you are anyway squeamish then perhaps take a rain check on this one. This is the second novel in the series, I hadn\u2019t read the first Ir\u00e8ne and was a little worried going into this one that I was missing out as it was part of a series but thankfully it works perfectly as a stand alone novel. I loved the characters in this novel, they were so well fleshed out and while I am generally not a fan of police procedural novels, this one really worked for me. Unpredictable, Suspenseful and full of twists and turns , Just a rocking good read and a book that I will remember a year from now. So glad I have a hard copy for my real life bookshelf.",
            "Shocking.Gruesome.Complex.Compelling.I did not like the beginning because I am squeamish. It was ugly. Raw and very Frightening.I continued and was rewarded with the start of an ingenious puzzle. A layered plot is so delicious and this was extremely satisfying and addictive.One starts with pitying the woman &amp, fearing for her : twist: pitying the men and fearing for them : twist : understanding the woman through those who knew her : pitying her : twist : cheering for her.It is brilliant in the effortless reveal of this complex and fascinating character. And that\u2019s just Alex.The detectives are each fully developed and wonderfully flawed. The rich nuances of their past and present relationships with each other and others provided so much texture.This is not a genre I gravitate to probably because a good mystery/detective/crime/suspense novel takes over my life until I finish the story. That\u2019s what ALEX did to me for 3 days.Bravo to the writer &amp, the translator for a tension-filled unforgettable story.I was thinking about who would love this book:Readers of Stieg Larsson with its tension, brutality, shocking events and turn of events.Readers of Gone Girl. I loved the twist in Gone Girl. Hated the characters by the end. It was strange to me becuase I couldn\u2019t recommend the book as it was too ugly and I didn't 'enjoy' it. ALEX on the other hand has multiple twists, characters you go through many emotions with and then the ending is brilliant. It is a rich experience with a full and extraordinary ending.",
            "This French author has a good police procedural series going: Police Commandant Camille Verhoeven. I note that this book (#2 in the series) is rated 4.1 with thousands of reviews \u2013 that\u2019s quite high by GR standards. I\u2019ll work from the book blurb so I don\u2019t give away more than necessary. Alex of the title is a young woman who has been kidnapped, savagely beaten, and suspended from the ceiling of an abandoned warehouse in a tiny wooden cage. Her abductor appears to want only to watch her die. Will hunger, thirst, or the rats get her first?The books start with chapters alternating between what the woman is undergoing and how the detective is trying to find her, and I thought \u201cthese cage scenes will get tiring and repetitive.\u201d I was reminded of another mystery I read where a woman was locked in some kind of decompression chamber and we had to read about her ordeal dozens of times through the whole book. But that\u2019s not the case in this novel. She escapes pretty quickly in an ingenious way.There are two things that make this book a bit unique among police procedurals. First, we have a victim (part 1) who is also a victimizer (part 2). Second, a lot of main characters are dead by the start of part 3 and you wonder, how is the author going to keep this going? He does a good job of it. So our detective has to have quirks. Verhoeven has a bundle of them. He\u2019s 4-feet 11-inches tall and we hear frequently how people react to his short stature and how his legs dangle off chairs. His wife died four years ago and he was so stricken he was institutionalized for a year. She died from a kidnapping. Can he handle this case? His mother recently died and he\u2019s having a hard time dealing with her estate. He has strained relations with all his co-workers and with his boss. They argue like \u2018an old married couple.\u2019 He\u2019s an artist and constantly sketches the victim, looking for something. His two male assistants are quirky too. One sees his job as keeping Verhoeven calm. The other is a sponge who is constantly bumming cigarettes off people, stealing food and sticking friends with meal tabs. A line I liked when a colleague asks Verhoeven to stand in at his (fourth) wedding: \u201cIt\u2019s strange how you keep marrying the same woman.\u201d Another: \u201cHe drinks like a Pole which makes him a good Frenchman.\u201d I have previously read two other novels by this author, one in the Commandant Camille Verhoeven series (Camille #4) which was pretty good but I actually liked better one of his books that was very different and not in the series: The Great Swindle about two down-and-out disabled WW I vets in Paris who come up with a scheme. That one was excellent and it won the Prix Goncourt in 2013. Top photo: Paris street scene from goodfon.comThe author from strandmag.com ",
            "Today I bring you a novel that has been exciting me. I had read and listened to a lot of good recommendations about the novels of Pierre Lemaitre, and I can corroborate that they are accurate. Therefore, it is not a book, I consider, suitable for sensitive readers but of course, if you like strong emotions, police novels and , above all, psychological thrillers I can tell you that this book is secure bet. Alley has a disturbing, agonizing and claustrophobic start. In the first place, we are not discovered or revealed almost nothing of the life of the protagonist, this is thus maintained for a good part of the plot. So much so, that I thought I expected that Lemaitre did not take my hair and finish the novel leaving me loose and unplapsed, of the guy: so I make me interesting. He had confidence that he was not like this for the good reviews received, as I mentioned, but he knows how to keep so much, and so well, the suspense that made me distrust me a little in plan: as in the end do not clarify all this, I kill you. I do not want to reveal much about the plot and I advise you not to read many synopsis because not all are as barely like the one that I have left you and can give you something that bothers you a little the surprise factor. \"He told you, after a Strong and chilling start, we are entering the plot of Alex's hand and, as not, of Commander Camille, in charge of investigating the case. A character with a lot of hook and quite peculiar, both in his way of being as in what his physique is concerned, and until here I read ... Little by little, we are rippled details of what happened throughout life of Alex. Camille, will not have it easy enough to be able to make discoveries, nor the reader either, but with great expertise it is pulling some threads and all it leads us to an end also quite strong, that will make us ice cream, with some atrocities that we discovered, And that you will unite and auction the whole story. Offering us, at last, all the answers we were waiting in a totally satisfactory way. In this way, everything collects and we feel great empathy, towards some characters, especially towards Alex, in the same way that we will hate with all our forces to others, by discovering the abhorrent and delegitable actions that they committed in the past. One per share and others by omission.Ah, an important thing that I forgot! If you are planning to read Irene, from the same author, you will have to do it before reading Alex, because nothing else to start this, we are totally broke down the end of Irene. Which I do not understand or I see the reason for being, because when it is independent books, because they are different cases, Solito Lemaitre closes the doors that you read or buy Irene if you have read Alex because you have spread the end ... in conclusion , a novel by the genre practically perfect, which takes a step further, as far as Valent\ufffda refers, offering us a plot and some strong scenes, sometimes, that it will not leave us indifferent. My score is: 8.5 / 10"

But the idea that the earth has a hollow interior was first proposed as a scientific theory in 1691 by Sir Edmond Halley (of comet fame), who also suggested that there might be life down there as well. ,Hollow Earth, traces the many surprising, marvelous, and just plain weird permutations his ideas have taken over the centuries. Both Edgar Allan Poe and (more famously) Jules Verne picked up the torch in the nineteenth century, the latter with his science fiction epic ,A Journey to the Center of the Earth,. The notion of a hollow earth even inspired a religion at the turn of the twentieth century-Koreshanity, which held not only that the earth was hollow, but also that we're all living on the ,inside,. Utopian novels and adventures abounded at this same time, including L. Frank Baum's hollow earth addition to the Oz series and Edgar Rice Burroughs's ,Pellucidar, books chronicling a stone-age hollow earth. In the 1940s an enterprising science-fiction magazine editor convinced people that the true origins of flying saucers lay within the hollow earth, relics of an advanced alien civilization. And there are still devout hollow earthers today, some of whom claim there is a New Age utopia lurking beneath the earth's surface, with at least one entrance near Mt. Shasta in California. ,Hollow Earth, travels through centuries and cultures, exploring how each era's relationship to the idea of a hollow earth mirrored its hopes, fears, and values. Illustrated with everything from seventeenth-century maps to 1950s pulp art to movie posters and more, ,Hollow Earth, is for anyone interested in the history of strange ideas that just won't go away.",

            "When Edmond Halley, the namesake of Halley's comet, stood before the London Royal Society in 1691 and announced that the World was Hollow, he could not have begun to realize the ramifications of what his scientific proposal would mean to history or literature.The Hollow Earth is a volume about this scientific misstep that would take centuries to disprove (and to a die hard few will never be accepted as an error). But if Halley hadn't made his mistakes (and successes in related theories), we may have not learned as much as we have about geology, magnetics, planetary development etc as generation after generation took to exploring things to prove or disprove the Hollow Earth Theory.Add in such figures as Admiral Byrd and the Secret Nazi Polar Expeditions, not to mention flying saucers, and you have some rather interesting material on the history of the Hollow Earth.It also examines, in it's second half, the entire genre of fiction that rose up from this theory, from serious works to Pulp Adventures to children's literature. This book is probably the only one out there on the subject, and that makes it the definitive work until someone writes a more detailed or concise one. It definitely is worth examining, for those interested in Science History or Historic Literature. It can also be useful for folks working with or desiring interesting roleplaying or writing venues (what is a Dyson Sphere except a really big hollow earth?)The author isn't dry and boring, and does have a touch of the 'Amused Enlightened Modern Man' to his approach of the material. This one is going to be on my reference shelf for some time to come.",
            "Meh. Great idea, bad execution. There's some fascinating stuff in the book but for some reason the author decided to take a tone of can you believe these guys? only a fucking idiot would think there is a civilization at the center of the earth instead of looking at them as products of their time. I'm not looking for some scholarly monograph, but often the author was a little too glib (the main problem is that he slides between serious, scholarly tone and a lazy blog-like tone, often in the same paragraph). Also, sometimes he would end paragraphs with something along the lines of well, it's too complicated and I won't go over this idea here. Hey pal, you're the author, I'm the reader. Do your job.",
            "Frustratingly stilted for what should be an absolutely perfect opportunity for a good popular science/ history book. Instead it feels a bit like the writer isn\u2019t ever fully committed to the madness of the topic at hand. It\u2019s not bad but was harder work than I was expecting",
            "_Hollow Earth_ by David Standish is a history of the hollow Earth idea.The scientist Edmund Halley, of Halley's comet fame, was a proponent of the idea. A second strain of imagining about the hollow Earth was in fantastic fiction, the idea appeared in the works of famous genre writers such as Poe, Verne, and Edgar Rice Burroughs. Also, the time--roughly-- from 1865 to 1910, saw an increase in the number of hollow Earth novels in the US. The writers of these novels used the idea of a hollow Earth as a canvass to present their vision of a utopian society. Hollow earth fiction declined in the 20th century, though did not entirely disappear, for example the (mediocre) science fiction stories of Richard Shaver, and tongue-in-cheek novels by Rudy Rucker and Richard Lupoff.A third strain of imagining about the hollow Earth is by fringe writers. Walter Siegmeister in his book _The Hollow Earth_, claimed that a benevolent race lives in the Hollow Earth, and UFOS flew into and out of portholes at the North and South Pole.A major fault of the book is that the author takes an unserious tone, for example lame attempts at humor. Also parts of the book were tedious. I wish the author would have taken the approach of another book I reviewed, _The Lost Land of Lemuria_, an elegantly written socio-cultural analysis of belief in a lost land. ",
            "Standish's book gives a thorough and lightly skeptical review of the Hollow Earth phenomena. This is a good way to discover what most Hollow Earth novels are about without reading them. In depth biographies of the major lecturers and authors gives a complete picture however it does not thoroughly address the Buddhist Hollow Earth theory of Aghartha."

            "It's a fascinating subject, but somehow the tone managed to be both too dry and too flip at the same time. The author buried interesting concepts under heaps of unnecessary detail, and attempts to break up all that plodding dullness with things like longitude was a bitch really put me off.I love both wacky historical beliefs and hollow earth adventure lit, but I realized pretty quickly that this book and I just aren't compatible. Eventually I flipped straight to the Edgar Rice Burroughs chapter, which mostly just summarizes Pellucidar books and (justifiably) calls out some of Burroughs's sexist bullshit.I doubt I'll read much more before returning it to the library.",
            "This is a fascinating and fun history of the idea of a Hollow Earth -- that is, the idea that inside the Earth is another world, possibly one with utopian civilizations and riches beyond humankind's wildest dreams. The author tackles the subject matter with considerable humor, and is at his best when describing and commenting on the various Hollow Earth narratives that have been written throughout the years, from Journey to the Center of the Earth to Tarzan at the Earth's Core and beyond. The chapter on modern-day Hollow Earthers falls a little short, and I'm still sort of surprised that there was really no introductory or concluding chapters as such -- he just sort of starts at the beginning and when he gets to the present day, he stops, with very little analysis. It's still a very entertaining and interesting book, however.",
            "In the history of weird ideas, the hollow earth has an amazing longevity. Standish does a good idea of showing how the concept revives from time to time, but never really dies out. This is an interesting look from several points of view, including those of fiction and science, as well as religion. For more thoughts about the book see: Sects and Violence in the Ancient World.",
            "This felt a bit like an academic paper: here is the history of the Hollow Earth in media since its suggestion by Halley, including lengthy plot summaries of every novel and film. If this sounds boring, well... yeah. Chapters 5 and 8 are worth your time. Not gonna lie, that Florida utopian cult city sounded pretty nice actually. All I gotta do is believe we're living on the inside of an earth-egg, and I can just hang around in gardens and play in an orchestra all day? Fine, sign me up!"

            "Garton's sequel to Live Girls has it moments, but it is most definitely second tier work compared to the first. NL takes place about 20 after Live Girls and our main protagonist Davey Owen now lives in L.A. with Casey, also from Live Girls, and now his vampire wife. The novel kicks off with a horror writer, also living in L.A., who has been causally investigating the existence of vampires for decades. Finally, he hires two pros-- both private investigators-- to track the vampires down. Are they just a myth or do they really exist. The writer gives the PIs basically a scrapbook of news about vampires, including a story published in the New York Daily News about the events at Live Girls in NYC. The PIs, who never met before, agree to the deal as the writer offers them a ton of cash for their efforts...Garton expands upon his vampire world here, introducing two types of vampires-- brutals and 'normals'. Normals just want to blend in to society and they do not feed on living people, one of them discusses how they run a blood bank coop and other ways the normals can get their fix. Brutals, on the other hand, are true predators-- it was brutals who ran Live Girls and their sex nightclub in NYC. Unfortunately for our main protagonists, the brutals will do just about anything to stay out the news. When they learn about the investigation, things start to get very hairy...Over all, a decent premise, but Garton merely hits a single or maybe a double with this one. This felt too much like a sophomore effort in a trilogy, something of a place holder, before the final denouement in the next volume. Lots of loose ends and plenty of room for another sequel, but that alone was not enough to justify my rating here. The dialogue felt awfully clunky at times, and even the attempts at dark humor (like the F-bomb dropping little old lady vampire) just felt off somehow. It lacked the clarity and drive of the first book, as well as the 'surprise' factor-- you knew what was going to happen just about off the bat. 2.5 stars, rounding up.",
            "Warning:: spoilers ahead!Sequels are a hard thing to do I understand that. So often a sequel will fall far short of its predecessor, it can sour the experience all together. Maybe its reader expectations or just that the author can't quite capture the magic a second time round.I bring this up because Ray Garton's Night Life was a massive letdown. Maybe I went in with the wrong mindset, maybe Mr Garton couldn't hit the right notes but the experience for me overall was disappointing.Lets get this straight right away. It wasn't bad. It was competently written, moved at a brisk pace and had enough sex and blood to satisfy the typical horror junkie. But thats where good things peter off\u2026To start with, this didn't feel like a Davey Owen book. It felt like a new story that Davey had been slapped into. So much of the story revolved around the new characters of Moffet and Keoph that Davey and co felt like a rushed afterthought. And even then the new characters had no real weight. Moffet and Keoph have no real personality and the overarching villain Victor Barna has little more than a couple chapters where he sits in his office and acts like a smug corporate prick.Come to think of it, the whole story felt rushed. Live Girls worked because the story was small and contained. Which meant a smaller more indepth cast. Here it feels like Garton is trying to shove an entire universe into a plot that cant accomodate it. So much of the dialogue is comprised of infodumps that just vomit the world into our laps. First rule of good writing: show don't tell.Which brings me around to one of this book's biggest sins: DEATH. Night Life is not subtle about showing you that shits getting real when Benedek and Casey are killed off. Now Benedek's death I could accept. He was older and he had an entire chapter devoted to building up his demise. There was genuine emotional impact behind his death.Casey however didn't get that luxury. Her severed head is delivered to Davey in a box. Now even ignoring the massive plothole there (vampires in Gartons universe rot in seconds upon death, so why didnt Casey's head?!) the way her death was handled was just sloppy. Up until that point, the writing suggested Casey had something up her sleeve only for her to die unceremoniously offscreen. Even the villains don't get the benefit of an awesome death. Anya, an antagonist from Live Girls is built up in Night Life as a dangerous opponent only to be shotgunned down in the book's climax. I get that death can demonstrate the cruelty of the universe, but when you kill a character the readers can identify with, punch them in the gut, not the balls.I have a theory about this book. Garton wrote this for one of several reasons. Either to shut the door on Davey Owen, to shut fans up about a sequel to Live Girls, a cashgrab, an aborted attempt to recapture the magic or an attempt to start a new series with Moffet and Keoph at the helm. I could be way off the mark here, but that's what Night Life felt like to me: a sequel that fell apart under the legacy it carried."

            "The lights twinkled through the haze of pollutants that hovered over Los Angeles. Happy anniversary, Davey, she whispered. He squeezed her tightly and said, Happy anniversary, Casey. They were gone in a fraction of a heartbeat, abandoning the red blanket bunched and tangled around the empty ice bucket. There was no one around to hear the fading sound of rapidly flapping wings of flesh on the breeze.Sadly not as good as Live Girls for me, but that was far from unexpected having read a few reviews before starting this novel.As Karen ate, Benedek said, What do you make of all this, Karen? I know it's your job to gather information about vampires\u2014 He always lowered his voice when he said that word. \u2014but what do you think so far? Frankly, I'm fascinated. Good. Your job may be dangerous, but at least it's not boring you.Not much a fan of fridging trope, but departure of two main characters from previous book was sad, bleak, and intense.Karen felt a little light-headed and fought to regain her composure. What she had just seen flew in the face of everything she knew to be true. There was no such thing as vampires\u2014they didn't exist, they were boogey men, the stuff of imagination and legend. Davey and Casey Owen smiled pleasantly at Karen and Keoph, who sat with their mouths hanging open.I appreciated how the author expanded the world-building introducing normal vampires opposing the brutal ones from book #1, such a shame Davey's long waited confrontation with a certain villain was too much rushed and weak in my opinion.She went out into the garage. Standing in the doorway, Burgess said, Get back before dark. That's when they come out. Denise started the Roadster as the garage door slowly began to open. She had the car's top down. Did you hear me? Burgess said. Get back before dark. She ignored him as she backed out of the garage, then drove away.Not liked much newly introduced side characters, but private investigators Karen Moffett and Gavin Keoph are a nice team of paranormal detectives at their debut, and I'm just curious to see them starring and dealing with werewolves in Bestial, follow-up to Garton's Ravenous.What are they going to ... do to us? Karen said. I don't know, honey. I honestly don't. But I can promise you one thing: It's going to be very unpleasant. Karen gulped. Thanks for cheering me up. I'm not going to sugarcoat it, Karen. We're in trouble. If they wanted us dead, we'd be dead already. They're keeping us alive for something, and whatever it is, it's not going to be good. We need to be prepared.'Nuff said.",
            "In this sequel to Garton's vampire classic, LIVE GIRLS, a bestselling horror novelist hires two private investigators to find out if vampires truly exist in Los Angeles, based on information he had been compiling for years. But they do exist, and live among us as seemingly normal people, satisfying their hunger for blood by buying bottles of it in secret vampire-run stores. But the deadly ones, called brutals, prey on mortals and vampires alike. Before long, they all find out the terrifying cost of prying into the affairs of the brutals. These aren't your melancholic or sparkling teen heart throb vampires. These are mean and nasty bloodsuckers, and Garton nails it with this frighteningly fun read. Highly recommended.",
            "There's something fantastic about reading a vampire novel every once in a while, they are usually free of the daily grind and every day problems, vampires can be both dark, deadly and romantic, you can argue for your life with one, that option isn't always available if you however deal with a werewolf, now that's an obstacle that is hard to cross. Ray Garton has penned a sequel to his marvelous first entry, Live Girls, which by the way was hot and amazing and totally delectable. In this novel the action resumes almost twenty years later, few characters come back, Davey and Casey are now married but their past is still haunting them, a curious thrill seeker has hired two private detectives to follow the New York Times journalist, Benedeck to his hideaway and to probe him about the past, to find out if vampires are real, if they in deed exist. The problem is that they are indeed real, and as long as they are left alone they hunt and abuse in their dark chambers, when they are seeked out by careless humans who want to make a buck they turn into vengeful creatures, killing and whiping out anyone who wants to out them and disrupt their sweet, syrupy pleasure of using and consuming humans. The problem is clear, vampires that survived are threatened again and this time they won't give up easily, they will go out and punish anyone who stands in their way.Night Life picks the story up in the future, but the abuse and hunger isn't any smaller. In fact the vampire emporium has really grown in the adult industry, using the primal human tug to eh-chant and attract people with money into it's clutches. In my eyes that has diminished their cool, the tingling, dark and corrosive vampiric desires was replaced by something cheap and dirty, hard to bond over. The novel was a nice read, I enjoyed it in one day, because I simply had to know what was going to happen next, but it was a bit weaker than the first, I don't know why everyone finds the need to compare the two but it's almost impossible considering how good this author is. His writing is so rich and fluid, his ideas without bounds, tickling our imagination and making readers out of the most stubborn people, who somehow have to have more. I hope that there will be a third book in this series, as I feel that the idea pool hasn't been drained yet when it comes to this story line. Some of the things that happened were shocking, it would be nice to see the aftermath of this little battle. I must however hope for a better cover, this one was really ugly, that's hardly a good thing.",
            "Not one of Garton's best. It's also, as often stated, not as good as Live Girls. However, it is still a good and fun read. Would make a great John Carpenter film, I imagine. Recommended if you're in the mood for some tight action and crazy characters. ",
            "Brutal.Characters not well fleshed out at all which may have been a plus. By the time everyone was gang banged I didn't really want to care about them.I am disappointed with myself for finishing the book."

            "By George HayHow much capital do banks need? Ask the Basel Committee of global banking supervisors, and it will recommend 3 percent of total bank assets. Ask tougher observers like the UK\u2019s banking commission, and you\u2019ll hear 4 percent. But ask Anat Admati and Martin Hellwig, the economists behind The Bankers\u2019 New Clothes, and you\u2019re in for a shock: they\u2019re after 30 percent.Bankers greet this kind of talk with a bemused shake of the head. Hiking capital, they claim, will just mean cutting the amount of lending in the economy by a proportionate amount. Super-high capital ratios would slash returns on equity to such an extent that banks would struggle to attract new private-sector investors to help increase lending. Ask anyone in the City and they will repeat, as if in a trance, that equity is expensive and pushes up the cost of providing credit.Admati and Hellwig tackle this argument head on. First, they argue that the idea of capital and lending being in opposition is baloney: capital - which should really be called \u201cequity\u201d to avoid confusion - is in the liability column of banks\u2019 balance sheets. It helps to fund assets - or loans - rather than sitting unused in a box. Banks with more equity can do more lending, not less.The authors concede that banks\u2019 ROE figures would fall if they had more equity. But any bank maintaining a 30 percent capital ratio will be significantly safer, which means that the cost of that equity should also come down. This is the \u201cModigliani-Miller\u201d theorem, which states that in an idealised world companies would be indifferent between funding themselves with debt or equity. More loss-absorbing capital should also make it less likely that taxpayers will have to bail banks out.Admati and Hellwig\u2019s analytical rigour is convincing. So why aren\u2019t banks voluntarily increasing the amount of equity on their balance sheets? The cynical view is that bankers have an incentive to keep capital levels low - less capital means higher returns on equity, and bigger bonuses. They spend plenty of money trying to convince politicians and the general public that equity is expensive. The authors marshal plenty of examples, reminiscent of Charles Ferguson\u2019s depressingly plausible 2011 film Inside Job, documenting how politicians, regulators and bankers are intertwined.But the argument for dramatic increases in equity faces a more fundamental problem. Banks are not necessarily subject to the normal dynamic, whereby debt becomes more costly as banks become more leveraged - and therefore more risky. Instead, taxpayer subsidies that mean big banks are bailed out in a crisis give them an incentive to borrow as much as possible. In the authors\u2019 own analogy, banks are like homebuyers who put down tiny deposits on their houses but know they will get rescued by a rich auntie if anything goes wrong.The problem for Admati and Hellwig is that this means bankers\u2019 objections have some logic. Adding more equity reduces the proportion of their loans that can be financed with artificially cheap debt. That\u2019s bad for bonuses and shareholders, but also for small businesses and families striving to get onto the housing ladder: their borrowing costs may go up.There\u2019s something rotten about this status quo, though. Even if the system enables cheaper loans, it also means bank shareholders and employees are protected from facing the consequences of their risky behaviour: taxpayers - the rich aunties - are on the hook. When bankers dismiss higher equity levels they are cynically and opportunistically confusing their private gains with what\u2019s good for society. They are like a chemical firm carping about the cost of insuring against potential losses from toxic spillages it has itself caused.The value of The Bankers\u2019 New Clothes is that it sets all this out in clear and accessible terms over little more than 200 pages, without cutting corners: the notes alone are over half as long. The problem is how to get the banking firmament from where it is now to where Admati and Hellwig think it needs to be. The authors\u2019 preference - bans on dividends to shareholders and forcible state restructurings of weaker banks - would require politicians willing to not only take on Wall Street but also explain why cheap financing shouldn\u2019t be extended to the poor and why potentially more taxpayer money needs to go into the financial sector. The authors\u2019 hard line on capital means they also underplay regulatory reforms that are already under way: supervisors have made some progress in safely winding up failing institutions, and while new Basel III rules may have only trebled capital requirements from a wholly inadequate starting point, they are better than nothing.That doesn\u2019t mean Admati and Hellwig are any less right in their analysis of banks\u2019 failings. But the sad truth is that when confronted with a choice between a freestanding banking system and one which periodically blows up but enables artificially low borrowing rates, politicians will tend to choose the latter. That means low bank equity - and overpaid bankers - could be around for a while yet.",
            "This book drives home one simple idea again and again for over two hundred pages -- the banking system would be safer if minimum equity requirements of banks were to be increased. They reject other proposed solutions to the current fragility of the banking system as being too complex or too easily evaded and reject a variety of arguments that have been put forth as to why an increase in equity requirements would be hard to achieve or better put off to a later time or would have negative effects on the banking system. They show how the explicit subsidy of deposit insurance and the implicit subsidy of the willingness to rescue banks that are too big to fail adds to the problem by giving banks incentives to load on as much debt as possible at the expense of equity. This book hugely oversimplifies the problems that the banking system faces, but that is not necessarily a bad thing, because sometimes complexity obscures simple solutions as was the case with the famous Gordian knot. An increase in bank equity positions probably won't be the cure-all that the authors claim that it will be, and I don't think that implementing it will be as painless as they claim, but they did convince me that it can be implemented relatively painlessly and in simple terms that make evasion difficult and that it is likely to do more to bring greater stability to the system than anything else that has been proposed. Because bank reform requires political action, the simplicity of the solution proposed in this book has a huge advantage -- it can be described and advocated in a few words, it can be sloganized, and a substantial portion of the electorate will be able to more or less understand it.The authors hint at other reforms that might be worth considering, such as breaking up the bigger banks into smaller businesses that are no longer too big to fail, or finding ways to make people who are part of the problem, such as managers and holders of junior debt or senior equity, bear more of the consequences when failures inevitably happen, but they don't really delve into those things because of their laser focus on the program of increasing equity requirements. There is one other major problem area that the authors barely mention -- the banks' huge trading positions in derivatives. They do say at one point that one proposed solution is to return to Glass-Stegall and make banks go back to the core business of taking deposits and making loans against them, but they reject that approach by saying that banks failed even when they were in that business, which is true, but the risk of that kind of failure has been largely fixed by the deposit insurance system. Speculation in derivatives creates a new kind of risk that is exponentially greater. Derivative contracts by their nature are designed to use leverage to increase returns so the kind of debt/equity ratio that may make sense when looking at a business that takes deposits and makes loans may be too low for a business that also speculates in derivatives, for which the risk of going to zero is much greater and the equity cushion needs to be correspondingly increased. This is something that is directly relevant to the authors' discussion of how big the equity requirements should be, so I was sorry that they did not discuss it, but I understand that their point was to describe a simple solution to what they describe as a simple problem and to sweep aside all of the complexities as being nothing more than attempts to obscure the real issues. So I forgive the authors for glossing over this problem, but I would have liked to see a more in depth discussion of how derivatives fit into the picture. Maybe they can write another book that deals with that part of the equation.",
            "After this, I\u2019ve had enough books about What Went Wrong With Banking. The trouble is, they all boil down to the same thesis: bankers took too many risks, banks became too heavily indebted, crisis ensued, but they\u2019re still at it. There\u2019s not much more to be said until some of suggestions for regulation that all these books suggest are actually followed, or some other radical change to banking occurs. I thus found 'The Bankers New Clothes' rather slow at first, as it goes over familiar ground without the edge of exciting reportage (Fool's Gold) or intense rage (Freefall: Free Markets and the Sinking of the Global Economy). I highly recommend both of the latter books, but was less impressed with The Storm: The World Economic Crisis &amp, What It Means and Crisis and Recovery: Ethics, Economics and Justice. \u2018The Bankers New Clothes\u2019 goes out of its way to explain the ways in which banks obfuscate and justify themselves, in terms rather simpler than I really needed. The analogous mortgage examples get a bit repetitive and are somewhat US-specific. (UK mortgages do not allow you to hand back the keys and walk away from the debt under any circumstances, whereas in the US this is sometimes possible in negative equity situations.) It\u2019s a good series of explanations for those with no prior economics knowledge, though, especially in terms of how \u2018capital\u2019 means something very different in a banking context. The much-repeated point about the importance of equity is well-made. Most books about the financial crisis don\u2019t go to the same trouble to explain precisely why highly leveraged debt is so dangerous.The purpose of this book is to dismantle fallacious narratives that banks use to (successfully) prevent reform of their industry. I think it achieves that with its measured tone and painstaking explanations. In particular, I liked the clarity about the linkage between poor risk management and fixation upon ROE (Return on Equity), which banks use as their metric of success and basis for bonuses. The most interesting parts to me were the final chapters discussing the Basel II and III agreements on banking reform and the extent of regulatory capture. I also couldn\u2019t help noticing that the actual text consisted of 228 pages, followed by another 133 pages of notes and references. I couldn\u2019t quite bring myself to do more than skim these, but they look very thorough. This is a somewhat stolid book, more textbook than reportage. Nonetheless, the content is enraging in light of how little banking has been changed by the catastrophic failures of 2007-8. My personal reading experience was in the three star realm, however I settled on four because I recommend it as a primer on What Went Wrong With Banking."

            "Many books have tried to explain the origins of the 2008 financial crisis, and many more have offered advice to prevent a recurrence. The Bankers\u2019 New Clothes is the clearest prescription yet to address the central cause of the crisis: the financial system itself, and in particular modern (overleveraged) banking. An outstanding book that should be read by everyone: politicians, regulators, bankers, and those with an interest in a stable financial system (i.e. anyone with a bank account, who pays taxes, or has a job).The authors share their motivation in the preface, they had \u201choped that the lessons of the crisis would be learned ... but ... were disappointed. There has been no serious analysis of how the financial system might be made safer.\u201d They follow with a caution, and then their goal, \u201cThe banking system, even with proposed reforms, is as dangerous and fragile as the system that brought us the recent crisis. But this situation can change. With the right focus and a proper diagnosis of the problems, highly beneficial steps can be taken immediately.\u201dWhile the motivation for the book was the recent financial crisis, the authors focus much more on the structure of financial institutions and the financial industry than they do on the recent sub-prime meltdown. In one set of examples, Admati and Hellwig link the 1980s US savings &amp, loan debacle and the recent \u201crogue\u201d traders at Barings Bank, Credit Lyonnais, and JP Morgan to the risk and oversight structure of banks, and the perverse incentives for individual and corporate risk taking - the same structural issues at the heart of the recent crisis. They also expose the repeated obfuscation of banks and lobbyists, highlight the complicity of politicians, and on occasion correct misinformation promulgated by individuals who should know better (former Federal Reserve Governor Frederic Mishkin). The authors\u2019 explanations of how banks work, in particular leverage and capital requirements, is exceptional. They start with an example everyone will understand - a home mortgage - and link it to the gain or loss the homeowner would experience if their home rose or fell in value over the course of a year. The same methodology is then used to show how a bank would fare given a similar rise or fall in the value of its assets, gains and losses are magnified due to the bank\u2019s leverage. An illuminating real world example is highlighted in their diagram of JP Morgan\u2019s self-described \u201cfortress\u201d balance sheet. Using US (GAAP) accounting principles the very high leverage is apparent, but using European (IFRS) accounting principles the leverage is almost double again!The global regulatory response to over-leverage is set out in an agreement called Basel III, which phases in over the coming years a new global agreement on banks\u2019 reserve requirements. The authors ridicule the effort as as wholly inadequate: too vague, too easy for banks to manipulate (what exactly are \u201crisk-weighted assets\u201d?), too lax (3% equity to total assets), and too slow to implement (2019 for the risk-weighted assets portion). Their prescription: issue equity immediately or stop dividend payments (i.e. preserve capital within the banks) until the capital equals 30%. Harkening back to the authors\u2019 initial example of a home mortgage, the banking system would move from a 3% \u201cdown payment\u201d to a 30% \u201cdown payment\u201d margin of safety. Alarming, disheartening, and a call to action, The Bankers\u2019 New Clothes could not be more timely or better written. Written for a general audience, the book explains issues and industry terminology very well, features outstanding examples and analogies, and concludes with specific remedies and an estimate of associated costs. As an added bonus the book features an unparalleled notes section, which at over 100 pages is a worthy read in itself. A truly outstanding effort.",
            "This is a must read, especially if finance is not your forte. Anat Admati and Martin Hellwig take a topic that is as equally unbearably boring as it is essential for the well-being of society, and make it understandable for the general public. That was their stated objective early in the book, and I think they accomplished that. What they reveal is not what those running the finance industry want people to understand, as it exposes alternative ways to make the finances of people whole and not just the banks. The bankers' new clothes are fallacies and bills of goods sold to politicians and the public, and the authors rip off those false threads to expose the bankers' beauty marks for all to see.Among the many solutions they advocate are appropriate regulations on banks, and the enforced separation of the interests of supervisors and those financial institutions they regulate. These measures include greater equity requirements in banks before they pay out to share holders, limitations on leveraged debt, and restrictions on innovations such as mortgage-related securities and collateralized loan obligations to hide their true debt exposure. And perhaps (in my opinion) the sea change most needed is having banks and their officers evaluated in light of the long term benefits for the bank's health, and claw back previous bonuses if their actions produce negative returns in future years. The short term profit motive must be removed.We don't need financial wizards running banks, we need competent and faithful accountants\u2014let the \u00fcber-smart people go back into science and medicine, where they belong and are the most needed.",
            "An interesting post-financial crisis book about banking regulation. Wait, come back! It's aimed at the layperson so is an easy read. Basically, banks take huge risks and develop complex and complicated financial instruments that attempt to hide the risks. They are in a somewhat unique position in that their stability affects society as a whole, as opposed to just the owners and investors affected by other businesses. Instead of treating this as a great and serious responsibility, they take advantage of it in every way in order to make more money. The solution from Admati &amp, Hellwig is for banks to be less leveraged by having a far higher proportion of their assets backed by equity/capital. If this causes some banks to be devalued or go out of business, that is too bad.Even after the Great Financial Crisis, politicians and regulators are not willing to take important steps to limit the risks posed by reckless banks to wider society. This is a time more than ever to reject politicians, companies and lobbyists that espouse anti-regulation policies and free-market dogmatism.",
            "The purpose of this book is to demystify financial language. Bankers use many misleading terminologies and claims which confuse everyone including politicians and regulators. Admati and Hellwig explain what finance is, does, and the fallacies created by misuse of language. Using a parable of The Emperor\u2019s New Clothes, pointing out the misleading claims and language of bankers in order to take appropriate actions. This book does a wonderful job at elucidating the claims of bankers to understand policy discussions and evaluate the claims. Banks contribute to making smooth economic exchanges via payment system infrastructure. Borrowing is an essential feature of a well and efficient functioning economy. Banks are more experienced in investigating the ability of others to pay loans than others. When functioning appropriately, borrowing creates opportunities to make large investments which would otherwise not be able to financed. But borrowing also magnifies the borrower\u2019s risk. When the economy is booming the investment earns more than the debt servicing, but the risk of investment default magnifies the cost of debt servicing. By not taking account of the potential loss of investment, banks can easy claim that borrowing is cheaper than equity. Equity reduces the potential gain and loss from an investment as the shareholders carry the risks. When banks did not have guaranteed bailouts, they used to have large amounts of equity to attract borrowers. A misleading term in banking is capital. Banks claim capital requirement will limit the ability of the banks to lend money, but capital requirements are not reserve requirement. Capital requirements refer to equity in the bank. Equity is a source of funding for lending, not a restriction. With more equity in the bank, the owners of the bank will have to pay the price should the bank fail. Banks considers equity expensive because they will have be forced to pay for the their mismanagement of risk rather than their lenders or taxpayers. Bankers benefit from the fragility of the financial system, but it imposes costs on everyone else. Unlike the claim of bankers that safety would hurt everyone, making banks safer would create stability without reducing lending or hurting the economy. Banks normally function based on maturity transformation. Making long duration loans of high interest rates while borrowing short duration loans of low interest rates. Most bank assets are long term which are not readily transformed into payments, which causes liquidity problems. This problem is normally surmountable, while the problem of not having enough assets to pay loans posses economy wide problems. The close to certain guaranteed government bailout of financial industry creates perverse incentives within the industry. The income generated by risky loans stays with those who made the loans, while the costs of default derived from those loans is borne by taxpayers. As bankers keep their prior earnings from the defaulted loans, there is an incentive to produce loans no matter their quality as they will not carry the costs of problems. The bailout guarantee also reduces the interest rate cost of bank borrowing, as their lenders know that they will regain their money should the bank default. The lowered interest rate acts as a subsidy to the financial industry and prevents policies which would make banks safer. The guarantee subsidies the creation of a more risky and dangerous financial industry. Bank regulation changes how banks behave, to either more risky practices or safer practices. Even before repeal of Glass-Steagall, banks have been defaulting due to many problems. Some decades saw very little bank defaults due to the performance of the rather than quality banking practices. Banks have always been risky, but also tried to better position that risk. Securitization which was supposed to facilitate safe practices, ended up transferring risk to others while creating more risk. Risk does not disappear, rather, it is a matter of by whom the risk is borne on default. Part of the reason for bailing out banks lies with contagion. If a bank owes debts to other institutions and goes bankrupt, it may cause the other institutions to go bankrupt as well. The interconnectedness of the financial system can spark global economic problems. Authorities are concerned about large institutions going bankrupt, but not so much small institutions creating a need to grow big to gain a guarantee from the government. This book\u2019s main solution is to have banks have more equity as it would reduce the risk that the banks cannot pay their debts and reduce their risk taking to protect that equity. The problem with this is who owes the equity. As the authors point out, corporations tend to fund themselves with equity and debt, while banks tend to only use debt. Corporate equity shows that the employees, such as the CEO, do not always have the best incentives for the company as any damages would be borne by shareholders and not the CEO. Meaning, the officers of the bank would not by necessity change their risk behavior if the equity is not owned by the officers of the bank. Equity is seen as a panacea to all bank woes, but it can create perverse incentives as well. This book is an eloquent description of banking structure. The focus tends to be on potential defaults, but that is because they are usually ignored in favor of more optimistic default-less future. Admati and Hellwig do a wonderful job at showing ways that debt creates risk and alternatives to debt. Making opaque the confusions created by bankers. Exposing many arguments as misleading and fallacious. Banks provide a fundamental service to all economies, but they also pose risks to those economies. The incentives given to bankers should not be perversely in favor of creating costs to societies they serve as current policies do. What is needed is to limit the risks posed without limiting the benefits they provide, which can be done with equity. ",
            "A book by whom he truly understands issues related to current economy and finance and that describes with a relentless coldness the vice of today's world banking and how bankers and other economic elites can convince us that certain behaviors and habits are essentialTo maintain stability in the economy when, most often, these habits are highly harmful to economic activity.",

        "desc": "A brilliant book by Nobel Prize winner Eric R. Kandel, The Age of Insight takes us to Vienna 1900, where leaders in science, medicine, and art began a revolution that changed forever how we think about the human mind\u2014our conscious and unconscious thoughts and emotions\u2014and how mind and brain relate to art. At the turn of the century, Vienna was the cultural capital of Europe. Artists and scientists met in glittering salons, where they freely exchanged ideas that led to revolutionary breakthroughs in psychology, brain science, literature, and art. Kandel takes us into the world of Vienna to trace, in rich and rewarding detail, the ideas and advances made then, and their enduring influence today. The Vienna School of Medicine led the way with its realization that truth lies hidden beneath the surface. That principle infused Viennese culture and strongly influenced the other pioneers of Vienna 1900. Sigmund Freud shocked the world with his insights into how our everyday unconscious aggressive and erotic desires are repressed and disguised in symbols, dreams, and behavior. Arthur Schnitzler revealed women\u2019s unconscious sexuality in his novels through his innovative use of the interior monologue. Gustav Klimt, Oscar Kokoschka, and Egon Schiele created startlingly evocative and honest portraits that expressed unconscious lust, desire, anxiety, and the fear of death. Kandel tells the story of how these pioneers\u2014Freud, Schnitzler, Klimt, Kokoschka, and Schiele\u2014inspired by the Vienna School of Medicine, in turn influenced the founders of the Vienna School of Art History to ask pivotal questions such as What does the viewer bring to a work of art? How does the beholder respond to it? These questions prompted new and ongoing discoveries in psychology and brain biology, leading to revelations about how we see and perceive, how we think and feel, and how we respond to and create works of art. Kandel, one of the leading scientific thinkers of our time, places these five innovators in the context of today\u2019s cutting-edge science and gives us a new understanding of the modernist art of Klimt, Kokoschka, and Schiele, as well as the school of thought of Freud and Schnitzler. Reinvigorating the intellectual enquiry that began in Vienna 1900, The Age of Insight is a wonderfully written, superbly researched, and beautifully illustrated book that also provides a foundation for future work in neuroscience and the humanities. It is an extraordinary book from an international leader in neuroscience and intellectual history.",

            "Best book about bridging the two cultures: art(humanitarian) and science. The author already has a Nobel prize, so you know you are in good hands. We should invent a new award for books like these actually. It is even better if you read the book in Vienna as you can also see some of the paintings in the Upper Belvedere and visit the other 2 museums (Josephinum and Freud) that had a big role in Kandel's life and in the early history of the ideas behind this book. Will try to read it again after I read some of the books included in its gigantic bibliography. Well done! Put it on the same shelf with Gombrich and Arnheim. I would also recommend to read this book following Kandel's autobiography: In Search of Memory, as the two books intersect in countless ways. I almost think he intended to write a 1000 pages book to cover both subjects: his life and the Vienna influence on modern research (especially in medicine, biology, psychology, literature, art). The influence of the Vienna Circle on the physics and mathematics of the 20th century is left aside maybe because the author is not an expert on these topics. When you look back and see that you had people like Godel, Wittgenstein, Klimt, Freud, Jung (for a brief period) and others living in the same city, you can only wonder how the world would have looked like without the two wars?",
            "Magnificent panoramic walk, with level guide: departure from the early twentieth century Vienna to come to us, between psychology, neuroscience, painting and literature. When you say that a book (moreover a merit of it: thanks also from here to those who gave it to me) change the way to see things. In this case, it is true to the letter. Walking, in addition to discovering surprising things, important things are also confirmed: that neurosciences are one of the most advanced borders of the path of knowledge (perhaps the most advanced), which through the works of art he produced, the human brain has anticipated Sometimes about centuries what the science has shown in the laboratory (which confirms on another plan that first comes discoveries and then comes the research), which must be aimed at a unification in a holistic vision not only of the sciences, but Also of sciences and arts, which for painting and narrative, as for everything that passes in front of us, we are we who literally create in our mind what we look and read: it is true every time, for everyone and for each. Our brain works like this: it is neither a recorder nor a camera. And it seems to me just a nice thing.",
            "Eric Kandel. A Coryphous in the Neuroscience area has again managed to bring a fascinating, incredibly detailed scientific book that combines both art and mechanisms of the brain.The book is divided into 2 segments. In the first area, Kandel talks about artists and scientists such as Klimt, Kokoschova, Leonardo Davinci, Freud, Schnitzler, and merges the findings of science and how she influenced art. But why we react people to art. The whole thing is decorated with pictures of the artists, so you always know what he refers to. In this way you learn a lot about yourself and why you are inspired by art for thinking. In the second part of the book it becomes very neuroscientific. In this area, Kandel works on a brilliant way all milestones of neuroscience - without losing the relation to the art. This book is a must-read because it is literary unique.",
            "Actually three books in one. The first is Vienna 1900 and includes a fine introduction to Freud as well as three artists \u2013 Klimt, Kokoschka, and Schiele. (The latter can be quite off-putting, but is a good example for some of the points made later in the book). The largest part of the book is devoted to understanding how the senses and brain perceive and interpret art and includes a truly phenomenal overview of about a century of brain research. The third book is more philosophical and explores creativity and consciousness. Extremely well written and illustrated, for anyone interested in psychology, perception, or neuroscience ",
            "My year ended on a high note, by finishing this most remarkable book \u2013 Eric R Kandel\u2019s The Age of Insight \u2013 The Quest to Understand the Unconscious in Art, Mind, and Brain from Vienna 1900 to the Present. The timing of this book was remarkable for me because it happened on the same year when my primary focus was to find a bridge that I can use to cross at will between my two passions \u2013 science and art. Right after I wrote a blog on this topic (Artists without Science), my Art Historian friend Arjun Gupta recommended the book to me. I immediately grabbed it and started reading, but quickly realized that it is not a book that I should read quickly, during my long daily commute, but rather cherish as a good bottle of wine, slowly, deliberately, and take my time to explore the art that the author uses to illustrate his point. (There was also a practical side to it \u2013 the book was too heavy to be carried around). Let me start with the author. Eric Kandel is a neuroscientist who has been doing some of the most remarkable work in his field, and during a time where there is a revolutionary explosion of new ideas, theories, and experimental results that are changing our view of the mind in the most fundamental ways. Kandel\u2019s work on the mechanism of memory also earned him a Nobel Prize in the year 2000. What makes Eric Kandel unique is not only his scientific authority, but also his deep understanding of the history of visual arts, and his knowledge and understanding of one of most remarkable time and place when it comes to modernist art \u2013 Vienna around the turn of the last century. Kandel starts the book with a detailed recounting of Vienna around 1900. It was a remarkable place and time when a number of brilliant people came together, each passionately involved in understanding the human mind, but from entirely different perspectives, and most unusually, they actually talked and exchanged ideas. There were philosophers like Moritz Schlick, Rudolf Carnap, Kurt G\u00f6del, and Ludwig Wittgenstein, musicians like Gustav Mahler, Arnold Schonberg, and Alban Berg, architect Otto Wagner, writer Arthur Schnitzler, and artists like Gustav Klimt, Egon Schiele, and Oskar Kokoschka. A common theme that connected these individuals were the evolving understanding that much of what happens in our mind is below the level of conscious thought. The new scientific ideas prompted the artists to look deep inside and explore and expose what is hiding deep within our minds.Such interactions, between people of different disciplines does not happen all that often, but it shows the fantastic creative potential when thinkers cross the line and take a look at what others are doing. We are incredibly lucky to live in one such period, when suddenly the walls between a number of different domains of knowledge are starting to collapse. Many age old philosophical questions are now being revisited as scientific problems. We are making remarkable progress in understanding mysterious phenomenon such as consciousness. We are connecting our sense of morality with the biology of evolution. This book does a remarkable job of connecting our sense of visual aesthetics with structures in our brain, the complex interactions between different parts of the brain, and our evolutionary history. It shows how successful artists \u201cdiscover\u201d these properties subconsciously, and learns how to exploit them to create the desired emotional effect on the audience. It also shows how the mind of the beholder, and not just the artist, that is at play here.In the rest of the book he carefully pick up different aspects of visual aesthetics and connects them with what we know today about the brain and the mind. It is a fascinating journey, beautifully illustrated with various artistic examples. Many of these pieces were familiar to me, but the book provided an entirely new perspective of looking at them. That to me is the essence of a great book and a great idea -- it makes you look at familiar things in novel ways.The author does not claim that we understand it all. These are just scientific possibilities at this point, were some ideas are more rigorously explored than others. But just as the brilliant neuroscientist V.S. Ramachandran also points out in his book The Tell-Tale Brain \u2013 a Neuroscientist\u2019s Quest for What Makes Us Human, it opens the door that these speculative ideas can finally be explored experimentally. This is a huge step from purely conjectural thoughts where there is no way to check if the idea can actually stand on it legs. It is just as important to realize that obtaining a deeper understanding of why a certain piece of art work emotionally does not steal away from the pure enjoyment. In fact I believe, from my own subjective experience, it could sharpens one\u2019s ability to enjoy art, and thus make the pleasure even more pleasurable. It is no different than our understanding of why human society, as an evolutionary entity, needs the emotion of \u201clove\u201d to tie us together as social units, makes it any more difficult for us to fall in love. We humans have a natural tendency to romanticize certain things as magical, as if beyond understanding. However, we have seen again and again in history, things don\u2019t have to be magical to be fascinating. There was a time, not too long ago, when sunrise and sunset were seen as magical. Today we know with all certainty how it works. But knowing all that, sitting on a sea shore, the sunset looks no less amazing or romantic. In fact, knowing that the sun is one of the billions of stars around us, and the fact there are more starts in the known universe than there are all the grains of sand on earth, makes it even more amazing.",
            "This is an incredible book, a real tour de force in explaining in layman's terms some of the most amazing and important recent developments in neuroscience, biology and psychology, at the same time relating them to the artistic achievements of Klimt, Schiele and Kokoschka in Vienna 1900. If there is a flaw, it is Kandel's avoidance of any discussion of music, and especially of Schoenberg, who also painted artworks that fit much better into his thesis than those of Klimt, Schiele and Kokoschka. The book would have benefited from a reading of the Schoenberg-Kandinsky correspondence. After all, it does not make sense to discuss the influence of the unconscious on art without quoting Schoenberg (art belongs to the unconscious). Nevertheless, the book is fascinating to read. And naturally on the science side, Kandel, a nobel prize winner for his work in neuroscience, is unparalleled. His goal is to make the science accessible and to open a dialogue between the sciences and humanities. In fact, the science is tough for someone unfamiliar with the biology of the eye or brain, but after 500 pages, even a layman will feel like he/she understands a bit how things really work inside our heads. Recommended for anyone who wants to understand the human brain and behavior, or enjoys good art, or both.",
            "This is, quite honestly, the best book I have read this year. It will probably be the best book I read all year too. It combined so many of my interests (art, psychology, neurology, art criticism, and art history) and was written so beautifully and convincingly that I enjoyed every page of it. I picked it up from the library because I was researching Klimt, and this was just a whimsical find. I need to give in to flights of whimsy more often. I think I have a greater appreciation for Freud and his contributions to psychology now than when I had to take a developmental psychology in college, quite honestly. I can't sing this book's praises highly enough.I would read anything else this author wrote, Mr. Kandel has definitely made a fan.",
            "  This promises to be a long, dense read but I already am fascinated after the first two chapters....",
            "Eric Kandel's book, The Age of Insight, is a brilliant study of the interrelationship between what we think of as the theory of mind and the theory of art as mediated by the science of the brain, a topic for which he won a Nobel prize in biology/physiology. Kandel, born in Vienna and emigrated to the US as a boy, opens the book with an assessment of the painters Klimpt, Kokoshka, and Shiele and the psychologist Freud, all of whom were part of Vienna's remarkable cultural life circa 1900.Freud is foundational to this study in that he proposed we live our lives only dimly aware that beneath consciousness lies a very active unconscious, which manifests itself not only in dreams but in everyday life. His theorizing coincided with and supported Viennese modernism/expressionism, an attempt to depict the dramas of interior life as opposed to the realistic scenes of exterior life. The artists in question are shocking in many ways because, Kandel argues, they were exploring realities hitherto hidden from the arts. He goes further when he makes the scientific case for ways in which Viennese expressionism reflected what we were coming to know as the biology of the brain. In some ways, Kokoshka et al ran ahead of science, in fact. Freud's theorizing, after all, lacked technical support for decades in the form of MRIs, etc., which could pinpoint areas of the brain engaged by representations of feeling as opposed to representations of physical fact.Kandel is generous in acknowledging the leading figures in the arts and sciences he cites as he makes his larger argument. For a wholly-consumed scientist most of his life, his appreciation of painting in particular is impressive. He does not advance Vienna 1900 as a be-all-and-end-all in the world of western culture, but he makes a solid case, and he adds to this case a very sophisticated survey of relevant scientific advances, covering brain biology, creativity, memory, vision, and language.In conclusion, Kandel calls for a continuation and deepening of the dialogue between the arts and sciences. Many on the humanistic side of the discussion might wonder who would be an appropriate scientific counterpart. Kandel definitely is one such figure, he cites dozens of others. This is a hopeful and encouraging book, albeit a challenging one. It's not light reading. But it's informed by genius."

Set in his home garden (in Beckham, Norfolk, England) Dan Pearson writes about his experience in 1997 to re-create the neglected garden of the home. It is written over a course of a year because he wanted to show the dramatic changes with the seasons.When he bought the house, wild brambles had overwhelmed the whole back garden, it had been untended for years. He started with a simple space of two terraces because he knew he needed empty spaces. He then planted a natural free garden around the terraces. He writes he wanted a think tank plus grounds aka \u201clab\u201d for his plant experimentation. He made it tranquil and vibrant at the same time. I find garden designer Dan Pearson to be an inspiring role model for all gardeners because he is so open and curious. This book reflects that. It is not a gardening book that tells you how to garden but it is a visual journal of his progress as he starts from scratch and rebuilds his beloved hidden garden. I recommend it highly. Gorgeous photos. Five green stars.",
            "Good gardening book. Sometimes it is too encyclopedic, as the author lists plant after plant he uses and what each brings to his garden, along with the difficulties and joys of each plant. But, following him as he considers his garden season by seasons provides a framework to think about your own. He notices and appreciates much more than just the bloom or smell of a good flower. He looks at colors and foliage and stems and heights in light and shade and when coupled with other flora and is effective as describing what pleases him. There's plenty of how to in this book if that is what you're looking for, but the best parts are when he is discussing how the arrival and lifespan of plants brings him joy. ",

            "Dan Pearson is a gardener and designer I have admired for many years and I often read his published press articles. From the early days, when I got my first garden and he had his first tv series, I've always felt I could relate to Dan's gardening style and ethos. Sadly, these days, I do not have a garden of my own and so reading gardening books is more of an escapism exercise, or planning for the long-term. I do garden on a small scale, in containers, but it's just not the same as having your own ground and Dan knows this, as he emphasizes at the start of the book - it just feels different when the dirt under your nails has come from 'your own' patch of earth. It's of course debatable as to whether any gardener really owns the land, as even a lifetime of gardening will end one day and nature always has the upper hand when it comes to deciding how things will thrive or change. A landscape can be radically overhauled and transformed but it's never in the gardener's control, entirely. So the story goes that Dan gets his own garden and shoe-horns as many plants into it as he possibly can, or something like that. This made me smile as I think it's what many of us would like to do if given our own space and a decent budget. If you are into plants and especially collecting plants, I think it is easy to relate to Dan's struggle with space, being disciplined and breaking your own rules every so often. Refreshing to read how he changed his mind about plants, gave things a chance, was ruthless with others. His relationship with the spaces around and beyond his garden was also interesting to read - how a garden is never an island. I've just recently begun to re-consider the plants I grow and have fewer than previously. I'm interested in creating a calm, less hectic space. So it was fun to read about Dan's layers of plants, abundance and divergences. Knowing that he has now moved on to a bigger gardening space, this book was obviously going to be about transition rather than a settling in. I get the feeling that whilst Dan Pearson may not want to create the next Great Dixter, or similar garden, he may indeed write many more books on gardening and I am sure I shall want to read them all.My only main criticism of the book is that photos featuring individual plants are often quite tiny and I would have accepted a smaller font for more photo space. I'd also have liked to have seen Dan with his partner Huw, or a group of friends in the garden, just to prove that it was not his own sanctuary but also from time to time a space shared, as I am sure it was. It would have been nice for the record.(book borrowed from library)"

            "This was a quite helpful introduction to Freud. It provides a quite clear outline of the main psychoanalytic theories and it includes explanations of key psychoanalytic terms.However, it is perhaps too didactic for my taste and a bit chaotic at times. In addition, there is not enough emphasis on Freud's constant revision of his theories, or at least, the evolution of psychoanalysis is not clear enough. Apart from that, there is an obvious neglect of Freud's theories of traumatic memory, which is precisely the part I was most interested in. I mean, they are mentioned but just in passing. In addition, the writer seems to feel guilty that Freud had no idea about what a woman wants and tries to somehow cover up for him.It is a good introduction for college students, but it is not detailed enough, even though all in all it makes a good introductory summary for anyone who is interested in getting an overview of Freud's most important theories.

            "This one sucked me in pretty much instantly as we meet our heroine, Constance, a thrice-widowed heiress who is exhausted from a long trip and immediately finds herself thrown into dealing with local politics, the complaints of the locals, and marrying off her terrified convent-raised teenage sister. She\u2019s cynical and competent and absolutely great. She\u2019s loyal to King Henry but she\u2019s resigned to the fact that she and her sisters are nothing more than pawns, Husband #2 was an abusive jackass and Henry handed him over to her regardless. The plot focuses on the heroine\u2019s life while providing enough of a historical backdrop (the king\u2019s Christmas court at Winchester, various battles, etc.) that it feels like the storyline really belongs when it is set. As we gradually meet our hero, Cenred - who starts out as Constance's prisoner, a wandering jongleur/minstrel, and as we learn comes from a different background entirely - we learn more about the greater European world and a lot of the history of the era. That said, this book is super old-school, which at times made it difficult to get through, Cenred rapes Constance and Constance's loyal knight, Sir Everard, rapes his love interest as well. In both cases the women immediately fall in love with their rapists. The rapes are written as love scenes. It's pretty gross. None of these consent issues are particularly unusual for old-school bodice rippers, so if you read those on the regular this will be fine, if you don\u2019t and you still want to give it a shot, the relationships are otherwise strong and unproblematic, so as long as you avoid the two rape scenes used to jumpstart the otherwise implausible romances, you\u2019re probably okay. I will also note that at a certain point in the middle I just started skimming, because the level of violence and drama was both high and... boring?... so I skipped fifty or so pages somewhere in the middle and floundered my way to the ending. Over all, though, a fun experience, I really wish more authors were writing medievals with all of the research and less of the creepy. ",
            "While I enjoyed the passion between the hero and heroine, I just couldn't get behind the heaviness of the historical details. I would have been happier with a simplified version of it all.The best scene for me was when Constance rose up to take back her kingdom. Hiding behind a supposed identity is nothing new, but I was left shaking after finishing the chapter. The whereabouts of Julien, that cur, is going to nag at me.This book was an easy way to pass a couple of days. Overall, this author didn't disappoint me. I will strive to read more of her works.",
            "The best of the series. Rich in historical detail, you really get an idea of how many classes lived in the middle ages. Cenred and Constance have a interesting courtship, and the author brings my favorite medieval tale into the plot: the story of Abelard and Heloise. The author reveals Abelard's cruelty, and the depth of Heloise's love. What would you do for love?",
            "This was an amazing book. Despite the cheesy cover, there was a lot of historical detail and I really was able to dig into the book and envision medieval life by way of the author's descriptions. The passion between the hero and heroin was intense and I thoroughly enjoyed. This book is a keeper on my historical romance shelf."

Good news for my bookshelves (digital, of course), bad news for my bank balance.The Character of Dr Steven Dunbar is incredibly well written, he is both human and clinically concise, compassionate and driven, talented and down to earth. I cannot wait to see how the character progresses and grows, and how he will react in the different situations he will undoubtedly find himself in.",

Doctor Dunbar manages to get to them, but how much truth lies behind their suspicions.There is heartbreak as parents struggle with coming to terms with their children needing organ transplants to survive. Imagine how you would feel. If there is something going wrong behind the scenes, you would want to know about it.Dr Dunbar puts himself in real danger as he continues his investigations. Even his own bosses are challenging him.The pace of the story is great, and the tension is high, but what makes me like this book so much is that it is believable. That is scary!The mystery rolls on until the closing pages, and the ending is worth it.Highly recommended.",
            "This is a really interesting medical thriller. It focuses on a new private hospital which is losing money and costing the taxpayers in government funding. The transplant unit is the only department in profit but there are concerns about 2 unexplained deaths so Dr. Steven Dunbar is called in to conduct an undercover investigation. There are 2 whistle blowers, both ex-nurses, a sub-plot of murder and a new transplant patient to protect.The style is very descriptive and flows nicely, there are clues dropped in everywhere that lead you to think that you know what the outcome will be from very early on in the book. The conclusions you draw will be wrong though as there are 2 very clever twists at the end which once you know what they are make perfect sense. There is also a love story sub-plot element which adds a little extra.I really enjoyed this book and found myself working along with Dr. Dunbar to try and unravel the mystery whereas sometimes with other similar books I find myself just following along rather than feeling actively involved.McClure has a very clever writing style with some good characters, I intend to read more of his books.Personal read 5/5",
            "Very interesting book. To see that young children die after a kidney transplant is interesting in itself but to see that there is something far more cruel going on is amazing. The first chapteer grabbed me and then the book fell a little flat. I must say that the last few chapters and the ending made up for it all. I felt nervous and apprehensive for Dr. Dunbar and Amy. I was hoping another child wouldn't die. It completey immersed me in the events and I was lost in my mind as I pictured everything happening before me. It was GREAT and for my first experience with Ken McClure...I will say I am hooked!",
            "This would probably be a three and a half star read from me, edging towards a four. A young girl is in desperate need of a kidney transplant, but strange and disturbing things are going on in the private hospital where she is admitted. It makes a lot of statements regarding NHS versus private, and the ethical dramas of organ donation which I enjoyed. Overall, a fast paced and easy to read novel which gives you food for thought!",
            "Well what a gripping story, when I started I really thought that this was another Robin Cook wannabe. How wrong was I, the twists and turns kept me engaged throughout. The human side of Dr Dunbar was very evident in the relationship with his daughter, Lisa, yet he can be so cold and clinical in the pursuit of the truth. I need to read the others to discover how Dr Dunbar develops."

            "Spoilers and Rant-The majority of the story was predictable and pointless. The book begins with Charley moaning about her agoraphobia \u2014 she's not left her flat or worked a case for 2 months since she was tortured. Anyway, that changes quickly enough when she takes on a case for a woman who's been tormented by a mystery somebody and just like that Charley's agoraphobia and emotional scars seem to vanish and she goes on her merry way to investigate the girl's tormentor. There were a few times Charley mentioned she wanted to be at home but those just felt like half hearted attempts at trying to show her slowly recovering. I wasn't impressed with Charley's post traumatic stress or how it was handled \u2014 it didn't feel realistic enough.There was a nonsensical side plot about a bunch of bank robbers that added nothing to the story. The actual long running arc in the series of Charley being a portal and Reyes being something or other and demons wanting to use Charley to invade heaven/enslave mankind, felt very much like an afterthought. Instead of focusing on the demon invasion, it's just forgotten about and the bulk of the story is taken up with Charley's 'case of the week' \u2014 a plot that won't add anything to the series as a whole. After 3 books, there should have been more about the demon shit going down and the oncoming war but apart from being attacked by demons sporadically there was hardly any development in that story. None of Charley's investigations matter to the series overall, so why does it always take up all of the book?!-The humour was grating. I initially thought Charley's humour was quite refreshing - I was just tired of all the emo, alpha bitch and angsty heroines but now her humour just gets on my nerves. First of all, her jokes are lame and induce much eye rolling and second her humour is inappropriate and never ends, not even when scenes/situations require gravitas. I can no longer stand Charley's awful humour.Charley-Charley was a dumb bitch..I don't even know where to start because her idiocy was that epic.-After Reyes set her up as bait for his psycho dad, Charley ended up tortured and almost killed. Is Charley mad at Reyes for this? No, well in fairness Charley says she is but she doesn't act like it. No, what she acts like is a horny teenager because Reyes is just that 'hawt'. After a few chapters, she gives up the pretense of being mad at him and stupidly claims that she was never really mad at him to begin with \u2014 she just forgives and forgets because in Charley's head there was actually nothing to forgive or forget in the first place. He did not betray her in any way \u2014 he had every right to fuck her over! -So Charley for some bizarre reason realises that she no right to be mad at Reyes. Not only that, she comes to the epiphany she was actually never angry at him BUT THAT she was actually angry at herself for being tortured by a lunatic \u2014 no, no it's not Reyes fault for fucking her over and setting up his sadistic stepdad to torture and kill her..it was perfectly reasonable for him to use the woman he 'loves' as bait for a psycho\u2026 Reyes did nothing wrong, if anything Charley's in the wrong, I mean she shouldn't have let herself get tortured..bad Charley for being a victim!! How dare she get herself tortured! I also don't know how she dared to be upset that Reyes got her tortured \u2014 the bloody cheek of her!!-Even though Reyes treated her worse than shit, Charley didn't care because deep down she loves when he uses and abuses her, it gets her hot and bothered..So hot and bothered that she starts rubbing up against Reyes every chance she gets and then she rewards him getting her tortured by having sex with him..as you do.-Funnily enough by the end, Charley was somehow made out to be the bad guy in the relationship because she apparently betrayed him (even though she didn't). So, Reyes then proceeds to throw a hissy fit and act like a bitch because naturally she deserves to feel his wrath. But when Charley was mad at him, he acted like she was being a bitch for deigning to be pissed at him, so it's okay for him to get pissed at Charley because his feelings are fwagile and important but it's not okay for Charley to get mad at Reyes because her feelings don't matter..ugh.-Charley believes everything that Reyes tells her \u2014 never mind that he's the son of Satan, never mind that he repeatedly lied to her, never mind that he was happy to sacrifice her life so he could get out of prison, never mind he was a general in hell for millennia, never mind all the evul he's no doubt committed, never mind that he treats her like shit, never mind he's done nothing to earn her trust \u2014 none of that matters god dammit because she's so randy and he's so hot and thus nothing else matters. Charley puts Reyes on a pedestal and no matter what he's done or what anyone else says, she doesn't care because Reyes is her pwecious, sexy, sex-baby-god from sexerton. -Even though Charley being with Reyes will probably cause hell on Earth, she refuses to give up on him because what's the fate of the world matter compared to getting laid by your hot abusive boyfriend?! Reyes even tells her she might need to kill him at some point in order to stop Satan and his gang from fucking over the world and Charley's all 'OMG, no way, your like super hawt, there's no way I could like kill that hawt body. I like can't believe you'd like even suggest that like. The world will like have to totes save itself, I ain't giving up my man, my va-ja-jay like needs you for like sexy times'.-I was pissed that Charley forgave her dad yet again. She just kept making excuses for him \u2014 sure, she was mad for a while but as soon as he gives her hug or says something nice, she forgets about all the times he shat all over her.-I got sick of the amount of times Charley kept throwing up and having to be saved by Reyes and Artemis - she was bloody useless. She's turned into an honest to god damsel in distress.-A lot of Charley's 'quirks' like naming her tits/car/sofa and drinking coffee was less quirky and more annoying.-Charley uses the word va-ja-jay for her vagina..ugh.Reyes-Reyes has been destroyed \u2014 he's a fucker. I can't believe I actually used to like this bastard.-I was hoping that Reyes would do some much needed groveling and begging for forgiveness. Did that happen? No, it was actually quite the opposite. He was mad at Charley for not 'getting the fuck over it' \u2014 he honestly believed she had no right to be upset with him or hurt by what he did. There was an apology but it was without feeling and just seemed insincere \u2014 he genuinely didn't give a fuck that he was the reason she was tortured. He didn't care that she was suffering or scared, he didn't feel guilty AT ALL. Was I supposed to believe that he loved her?! Because him lacking empathy towards Charley's pain and being indifferent to her suffering made me think the opposite.-The way Reyes treated Charley was vile \u2014 he constantly pushed her around and grabbed her throat, bullied her, intimidated her and abused her. The only reason I can think he did that was because he's probably a wife beater and likes to hurt and control her. He wants Charley to be his good little submissive bitch and that's why he's always threatening and hurting her. Oh well, at least Charley seemed to like being abused.-All of Charley's family and friends kept going on and on about how Reyes saved Charley from Earl..they were all hugging him and thanking him and he was loving all the thanks and hero worship, even Charley felt grateful for him rescuing her. Naturally, I was screaming WTF IS THIS SHIT!! It was his fault she was attacked in the first fucking place!! Why does Charley forget that?! And why does Reyes accept all the thanks and shit from Charley's friends and family like he's proud of himself for saving her?! He's disgusting!! He should have felt guilty and awful when everyone was thanking him because it was his fucking fault for putting her in danger and not protecting her but no, he likes his ego being stroked. The dick.-Reyes got angry about the picture she kept of his abuse\u2026 after what he did, it was just bizarre that he got all self righteous about trust and betrayal \u2014 it's not like she framed it or masturbated over the damn thing!! She was keeping it as evidence, it was hardly a betrayal. But Reyes likes making Charley feel like shit \u2014 he gets off on it and so anytime he thinks she does something questionable he starts to make her feel like shit. Nice.-Reyes may claim to wuv Charley but there's no evidence to support that. He's just horny for her because it's forbidden. The only people he has genuine affection for is his pseudo sister and his 2 friends\u2026 And it's bizarre how he cares more for them than Charley since his whole reason for being on Earth is because he wanted and wuved Charley..so why does he show his sister and friends more love than Charley when she's his whole purpose on Earth??-Why the hell did Reyes not pay Charley the money he owed her?! He just wants her to struggle. He gave his sister 50 million dollars which she doesn't even use and then he refuses to give the 1 million he owes Charley! WTF?! He needs to pay Charley and what does it matter if he takes the 1 million from the 50 million that's never been used?! Does he think his beloved sister can't live off 49 million?! His sister doesn't even want the money that's actually rightfully his! Charley has a right to her money but because Reyes doesn't want her to be happy and worry free he won't pay her. He makes sure his sister's comfortable and looked after but he doesn't seem to give a fuck about Charley's well being. It's weird - I actually thought he seemed more in love with his sister than Charley. All he felt for Charley was lust.-I got tired of the amount of times that Reyes lowered his head and looked at Charley from underneath his lashes. Was it meant to be sexy? Because I thought it was actually quite girly.Charley's dad- Where do I start with this fucker?! How many times has this guy fucked Charley over?!1. He let Charley's stepmum treat her like shit all her life.2. He used her on his police cases when she was a child so he could further his career. He didn't give a fuck about traumatising Charley as long as he looked like the top dog at work.3. Like Reyes he set her up as bait to be killed so he could save his wife and other daughter who he loved more.4. When Charley was lying in a hospital bed recovering from being tortured, he called the police so she could be arrested.5. He shoots her not once but twice!! He claimed he wanted to see if she could protect herself or some shit but he actually wanted to kill her.I was pissed that instead of Charley's dad winning back her trust with time and love and shit \u2014 he was given cancer so that Charley would forgive him and see the bigger picture or some shit. It was a cheap way to make everyone sympathise with him but it didn't work on me \u2014 he was a dick full stop.This guy was the biggest mother fucker ever! I was pissed by what he did in the earlier books and I had thought he might try to redeem himself in this one but he didn't he just kept betraying Charley and shitting all over her.I absolutely hated this \u2014 it was rubbish. Charley had no backbone, she was a doormat especially when it came to Reyes and her dad. She reacted like a dolt when they betrayed her by brushing what they did under the carpet. I no longer like the romance - Reyes and Charley have some chemistry but that's all they have, they don't have a swoon worthy or epic relationship because there's no love, trust or affection there \u2014 it's just sex and lies between them which makes them an unattractive couple. I'm not interested in the 'investigation of the week' type plots, I'd rather have read more development on Charley's destiny and the demon war. This was disappointing - I can't say I won't read the next book because I did enjoy the first 3 books so I'm consequently hoping for a miracle in the fifth one."

            "Fourth Grave Beneath My Feet by Darynda Jones is a 2012 St. Martin's Press publication. \u201cI meant to behave. There were just too many options.Time to check in with Charley Davidson again after a brief hiatus. After surviving yet another series of traumatic events, Charley becomes reclusive, spending all her days maxing out her credit cards watching the home shopping channel. Cookie finally steps in and takes matters in hand, and before long Charley has a new case to solve. This time a troubled young woman is convinced someone is trying to kill her. Soon, Charley suspects her new client is holding the key to the mystery inside her own head, in the form of repressed memories. Meanwhile, Charley and her father continue their feud and Reyes can\u2019t leave Charley alone. However, he offers her a few more clues about her many powers and abilities, as their relationship deepens on an emotional level.  I decided to give this series one more shot after book three, which almost put me off the series entirely, because Reyes\u2019 behavior towards Charley made me squirm. I\u2019m glad I decided to give the series a second chance though- although I think it works out better if I space the books out, instead of reading them too close together. The humor is top notch, and the series is certainly outside the box, but the stories also drain my emotions. This installment follows the same format as the first three books in the series. It is action-packed, with big emotional wallops, and laugh out loud dialogue. There is, of course, a very compelling mystery to solve, as well.However, Reyes\u2019 is much better behaved in this installment and his and Charley\u2019s relationship shifted significantly, although Reyes is still too prideful at times. Not only that, this chapter also showed some maturity and growth instead of relying too heavily on the action and sexual tension. Now I am excited again about this series and am looking forward to meeting up with Charley again in the future- just not the immediate future. 4 stars",

            "My fourth adventure with Charley Davidson, the most unlikely Grim Reaper you could possibly imagine. It was an entertaining read but not remarkable.Charley is recovering badly from the unpleasant events of the last book. Fortunately she has plenty of friends, both alive and dead, to pull her out of her misery and get her going again. And luckily for us she never loses her sense of humour.At last we begin to discover a few things about her true background although every word has to be dragged grudgingly out of Reyes. I am not sure whether he has a reason for not telling her or whether he is just a grumpy so and so. I tend towards the latter judging by the rest of his behaviour. There are also a couple of advances towards revealing Charley's full powers. Highlights in this story - Artemis, Angel and Swopes. More of all of them I say!!! Anyway, on to book five.",

            "Excellent book and conclusion to the series. Cameron is at his wit's end. Someone is killing the waitresses at the Cowboy Cafe but whoever it is isn't leaving any clues behind. Mary is worried about her waitresses and now she starts to think the deaths are aimed at her personally. Mary and her son came to Grady Gulch eight years earlier. Shortly after that she bought the cafe and has been running it ever since. While Mary is friendly to everyone she keeps her own life very private. When she starts getting things that remind her of her old life she goes to Cameron and confesses her past to him. I really liked Mary. She took control of her life when her husband's abuse became too much, doing whatever was needed to keep herself and her son safe. I loved the way that throughout the series she was always there to help others who needed it. She has been drawn to Cameron since the very beginning, but because of her past does not allow herself to pursue those feelings. When she starts receiving reminders of her past she realizes that the murders may be related to it, so she decides to go to Cameron and tell him everything. She is afraid she'll end up in jail and also fears Cameron's reaction to her story. She doesn't want to lose his friendship. When those fears are relieved their relationship starts to heat up, but Mary fears that Cameron will now become a target. She also doesn't really trust her feelings and fears risking her heart.Cameron has been attracted to Mary since she arrived in Grady Gulch. He seems to be content to see her every day at the cafe and doesn't try to push a relationship. I liked the way that he has a softer side that shows in his care for the little dog and the way he is there for Mary's son. When the murders begin being around Mary is the only thing that relieves his stress a little. When she comes to him and confesses her past he is stunned. He is also angry at everything she went through and impressed by what she has made of her life. The first thing he does is check into her story and finds that she is not guilty of what she thought she was. He then uses that information to find out if her past has indeed come to Grady Gulch. I really loved his determination to solve the murders and to keep Mary and her son safe. Even when Mary initially rejects his love he is intent on remaining close to her. The suspense itself, of discovering who was killing the waitresses was very intense. Cameron and his deputies are stymied by the complete lack of evidence at the scenes and frustrated by their inability to make progress on the case. As we finally discover the who, the question becomes how. The mind games played on Mary amped up her fear. When the final confrontation came the disclosure of the murderer was an unexpected twist. I loved the way that Mary was able to take control and face him down.",

            "Do not view my rating on this book as an indictment of the science. The story of the discovery of the structure of DNA is a fascinating one and makes for a compelling must-read book. The research behind it merited a Nobel Award... But as any first year science student worth their salt can tell you it is a story mired in controversy. I was enthralled by the continuous advancement of ideas that led to the double helical model that we all are familiar with today, but what is deeply unsettling about this account of those events is the almost casual misogyny that bleeds off practically every page that features Rosalind Franklin. I don't think that one or two paragraphs in an epilogue, to attempt to paint her in a better light after defaming her character for the entirety of what has gone before it, can fully rectify the situation. This book recounts the occurrences during the early 1950s from the viewpoint of James Watson so the question could be asked, does the time period and accepted societal viewpoints excuse his narration of the events? This was a highly educated man. An intelligent man. Surely a man such as that should be held to higher standards and should have been a voice for equality and not one spreading misogynistic ideas?If Franklin had lived it also would have highlighted the quandary over whether or not she would she have been awarded a Nobel prize too? Undoubtedly her work was a key component in determining the structure of DNA. However, a Nobel Prize can only be awarded to a maximum of three people. Who would have lost out? Would perhaps the medical prize have been awarded to Watson and Crick and the chemistry prize to Franklin and Wilkins? Sadly we will never know. Rosalind Franklin died from ovarian cancer before the awarding of the 1962 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine which was jointly awarded to Francis Harry Compton Crick, James Dewey Watson and Maurice Hugh Frederick Wilkins for their discoveries concerning the molecular structure of nucleic acids and its significance for information transfer in living material. (ref. www.nobelprize.org)Has history been too kind to Rosalind Franklin and placed too much gravitas on her scientific work? Do we vilify James Watson and triumph Franklin as some sort of wronged feminist icon? Would Watson and Crick have determined DNA structure as quickly without access to Franklin's research....I know what I believe.Five stars for the science But one star for the blatant misogyny which I cannot condoneA prior knowledge of DNA structure and protein synthesis is best to enjoy this book and at the very least some basic understanding of the various principles of chemical bonding.",
            "The Double Helix (1968) is written by Dr. James Watson (b.1928) an American molecular biologist that only had moderate knowledge of mathematics, genetics, and chemistry when he began his research to uncover the structure of the DNA.These autobiographical accounts for the most part take place between the years 1951 and 1953, during which, Watson, takes the reader though the events, roadblocks, and uncertainties he faced until discovering the secret to life. The sacrifices, Watson, made were mostly fueled by his desire to become a renowned scientists and his dream of winning the Nobel Prize. As a result, Watson, together with his colleague, Francis Crick (1916-2004), from the University of Cambridge and Maurice Wilkins (1916-2004), from King's College London, were awarded a Nobel Prize in 1962 for discovering the molecular structure of the DNA.But it was Wilkins' colleague, Rosalind Franklin (1920-1958), who was marginalized, hence being a woman scientists, as the double helical structure was significantly based on her X-ray diffraction (crystallography image) patterns that were shown to Watson and Crick without her knowledge and consent. Franklin's excessive exposure to radiation was in all likelihood the cause of her cancer that resulted in her untimely death. Nevertheless, their work and discovery was a quantum leap in the field of genetics.But as far as the book is concerned, this first-person narrative was somewhat colorless with only skin-deep descriptions and illustrations of the science behind the discovery. There was also a subtle trace of a discriminatory tone, Watson, employs when referring to women in his stories. I mostly recall the women either portrayed as snobbish or sex objects. To be fair, he does speak very highly and sincerely of Franklin in his epilogue, but she was no longer alive at the time it was written.Also, the only semi-eventful development of the story was the competition between the laboratories in England (underdogs) and the laboratory in Pasadena (favorite) headed by the renowned scientists, Linus Pauling. Where the underdogs beat the heavyweight to the punch and first discovered the two intertwined chains structure that ended up becoming one of the greatest scientific achievements of all time.",
            "\u201cIn the end, though, science is what matters, scientists not a bit.\u201d \u2015 Steve Jones in, James D. Watson's The Double HelixI gave it three stars last night (DNA night, thanks Riku), but that just didn't seem right. The structure wasn't stable, and I felt it probably deserved four stars (one for A, one for T, one for G, one for C, also one for Watson, one for Crick, one for Wilkins, and yes one for Franklin).Short, interesting, personal and important but also sexist, biased, &amp, according to Crick a violation of friendship. Watson's attitudes towards Rosalind Franklin today seem so maligned that Watson eventually had to clarify that these were attitudes and view at the time of the discovery and not when he wrote the book. Still, despite this major and very real issue, the book (along with Watson, Crick &amp, Wilkins contributions) cannot be undersold. The discovery of DNA's structure changed biology and the book catapulted Watson &amp, Crick into that pantheon of fame that is seldom reached by even Nobel-level scientists.",
            "Shows how arrogant, misogynistic, and plain stupid the discoverers of DNA's double helix were. Pros: Emphasizes the importance of being able to access a free, open, creative, in some ways childish state of mind in order to allow for truly creative and defocalized states of mind that allow for scientific discovery. Tunnel vision can be a scientist's worst nightmare.Cons: Shows how childish, pretentious and socially inept the scientific establishment can be. Also shows how a great scientist who suffered in silence due to being surrounded by sexist men in positions of authority was robbed of credit for providing the critical evidence necessary for finding and verifying the structure of DNA. Rosalind Franklin, you will not be forgotten. "

            "Gossip, backstabbing, petty squabbles, arrogance, snobbishness, and misogyny take a front row seat in this personal account of how the double helix structure of DNA was discovered. I expected more from Watson's book. And then there is the question about Rosalind Franklin's contribution to the discovery.While Watson does spend some time in the epilogue to credit Franklin for her work on the subject, it seems too little, too late. He spends the entire book painting her as an uncooperative, dour, argumentative, bossy, frump with an acid smile in a career mostly reserved for unattractive women who have little chance of catching a husband. (He actually introduces her in the book in almost exactly those terms.)Oh, and there is little explanation of the structure of DNA itself. It really is more of an account of his thoughts on girls, stomach pains, and on the personal lives of people Watson encountered when working on the project. ",
            "James D. Watson became a controversial figure later in life, but this story recounts the seminal event in his life: the 1953 discovery of the structure of DNA for which he received the 1962 Nobel Prize in Physiology with his collaborator Francis Crick and another, Maurice Wilkins. Watson is an excellent storyteller, something which cannot be said of most scientists. He successfully ensnares the reader into the drama of the moment, describing the personalities involved and making the science attainable to any reader. The discovery of the double helix as the structure of DNA is perhaps the most remarkable event in biology after Darwin's grand theory of Evolution. Watson and Crick devised the structure using tinker-toy-like models and corroborating their findings with x-ray crystallographs which were surreptitiously taken from the laboratory of Rosalind Franklin. Watson was a wunderkind American who acquired his PhD in zoology at the age of 23, Crick was a 35 year-old boisterous gad-about who was struggling for direction, having earned his BS in physics and unable to get the proper motivation for a PhD. The unlikely duo hit it off and agreed that DNA biochemistry was the ticket to recognition. At this time Linus Pauling at CalTech was transitioning his emphasis from proteins to DNA, setting the stage for a race to find the secret of the genetic code.Watson spins the yarn in dramatic fashion, writing in 1968, fifteen years after the discovery and 6 years after the Nobel. He offers an apologia of sorts to Dr. Franklin, who was taken aback by the use of her xrays without permission. Watson admits that her gender had much to do with the raw treatment she received in the male-dominated world of science. Franklin did not receive a Nobel because she tragically died in 1958 from ovarian cancer at the age of 37, and the Prize is only awarded to living scientists.I cannot believe that I've never read this book before. It's relatively short and remarkably easy to read. I highly recommend this to anyone who has any interest in science, medicine or the history of the 20th century. ",
            "The Double Helix is a wonderfully candid recounting of the scientific process, revealing the interplay of conditions precedent\u2014especially technology, observation and theory\u2014and the human condition\u2014especially ego, competition and teamwork. I can\u2019t help wondering that many, if not all, of the scientists revered through history are really the beneficiaries of much good fortune and coincidence. Of course, they were accomplished and driven, necessary prerequisites to greatness, yet those factors are not enough, for a large amount of their success seems due to pure serendipity."

        "desc": "The book of Deuteronomy is a call to obedience--the proper response to God's faithfulness and love. Consisting primarily of speeches that Moses gave to the Israelites shortly before they entered the Promised Land, Moses' words proclaimed God's covenant faithfulness in hopes of motivating the Israelites to obey God despite the coming temptation to conform to the Canaanite culture.,The challenges they faced then are remarkably parallel to those facing Christians today as we grapple with the issue of obedience in a world that offers other attractive ways of life. We wonder: ,How can we be faithful to God? And how do we help our children and the people we lead to be faithful?, This book tells us how Moses tackled these challenges and, as Paul confirms in the New Testament, Deuteronomy serves \"as an example...written down for our instruction\" (1 Cor. 10:11).,Ajith Fernando unpacks the relevance of Deuteronomy and captivates us with rich anecdotes from his thirty-five years of ministry to first-generation Christians in Sri Lanka. He offers concrete examples of how the truths contained in Deuteronomy can be applied, and he teaches us that obedience is the necessary response to the God who loves and saves us.,Part of the Preaching the Word series.",

            "Deuteronomy is one of those books that many find themselves bogged down in as they work their way through their yearly Bible reading plan. All of the laws, regulations, and endless chapters of do\u2019s and don\u2019ts seem very far removed from 21st century Christianity. Furthermore, finding a commentary that you can connect to and for that matter, one that demonstrates with great clarity the underlying message of the book of Deuteronomy is itself a challenge. Ajith Fernando\u2019s effort on Deuteronomy aptly subtitled Loving Obedience to a Loving God which is part of the excellent Preaching the Word commentary series, is theologically deep while at the same time providing the reader with the necessary connections to the fundamental message God is declaring in Deuteronomy to believers throughout history.A book of the Bible such as Deuteronomy can be confusing and admittedly boring to read unless one grasps what God is saying. Ajith Fernando rightly notes at the outset of this commentary that Deuteronomy emphasizes \u201cThe importance of constantly being aware of the holiness of God and how it influences a faithful life. In fact, in the Old Testament the life of faith is often described as walking in the fear of the Lord, an emphasis that may be needed today when people tend to be careless about sticking to Christian principles in every sphere of life.\u201d Such a statement helps the reader better understand that Deuteronomy is far more than a collection of antiquated rules. It is a book about what obedience and holiness looks like and how we are to respond to God\u2019s grace extended towards us.Fernando first establishes some needed background information on Deuteronomy, noting matters of authorship, historical, and geographical importance noting the reality that \u201cThe fact that Deuteronomy was written to a specific context adds a freshness and relevance to it.\u201d I appreciated the focus Fernando gave to helping preachers, who are after all the target audience for this commentary, understand and relate to the manner by which Moses shared God\u2019s commands and word with the people of Israel. It is important to realize Moses understood the need to \u201cgive the people the word of God that will mediate to the people the health and stability they need in order to face their challenges successfully.\u201d After establishing these vital foundational matters for engaging Deuteronomy, Fernando then begins his exegesis of the text. Since this is a rather lengthy commentary that is replete with salient insight, I will focus the remainder of this review on a couple of notable highlights.In his analysis of Deuteronomy 1:19-33, Fernando aptly discusses the issue of fear versus faith. The people of Israel are camped at Horeb and have been given the command by God to depart in order to finally enter the Promised Land. One can only imagine the tense feelings that permeated the hearts and minds of the people during this time of uncertainty. Recognizing that element of fear, Moses reminded the people the Promised Land is the place \u201cwhich the Lord our God is giving us\u201d, demonstrating in that statement the certainty of the outcome. The first step towards entering the land of promise was faith in God and His promises. Fernando rightly notes \u201cThis passage shows us that fear is a reality that we should combat with our belief in the sovereignty of God. And to encourage us to believe, we have a whole history of God\u2019s glorious dealings with his people. Fear is a reality, but it does not need to overcome us and lead to defeat. We can overcome it with our faith in God\u2019s sovereignty.\u201d Such a concept is something pastors can and should include in their sermons and Fernando does an excellent job of relating how the situation facing the people of Israel and their penchant for fear is nothing new. Such fear can only be defeated by faith in our sovereign God.Another excellent portion of this commentary is Fernando\u2019s discussion of Deuteronomy 5:18, namely the command \u201cAnd you shall not commit adultery.\u201d In an age where sexual promiscuity truly permeates all of secular society and unfortunately even within the church, it is as important as ever to declare from the pulpit God\u2019s commands for righteousness when it comes to matters of sex and purity. Fernando correctly states \u201cThe seriousness of adultery lay in the fact that the family was an absolutely vital aspect of the covenant relationship of God with the community of Israel.\u201d He further avers \u201cThe Bible takes the principle of commitment that lies behind God\u2019s covenant relationship with humans and the covenant relationship between a man and his wife very seriously.\u201d A violation of that covenant is a violation of God\u2019s commands which of course is outright sin. Throughout Scripture, God continually demonstrates His abhorrence of adultery. Whether it was in the life of King David or Paul\u2019s command to the Corinthian Church to flee sexual immorality, the covenant of marriage is something God takes very seriously meaning it is something His people should take with the utmost seriousness as well. There is no wiggle room with adultery. In order to combat the temptation of sexual sin, Fernando rightly reminds the reader to find an accountability partner and to \u201calways remain on guard against the enemy. It is dangerous for anyone to think that he is above temptation in this area.\u201dA final aspect of this commentary I enjoyed was Fernando\u2019s discussion of the pilgrimage festivals outlined in Deuteronomy 16:1-17. I have long found the Feasts of the Lord to be a fascinating study of God\u2019s faithfulness to His people. They are far more than simply dates on the Jewish calendar or something completely unimportant for believers today to read and understand. As Fernando rightly states, \u201cThey were occasions of great joy and of affirming truths that bonded the community together.\u201d Furthermore, these feasts carry great importance in God\u2019s salvation history calendar as the spring feasts have been fulfilled by Christ and the fall feasts in large part have yet to find their complete fulfillment. In fact, when we partake of communion for example, we are remembering Jesus as the Passover Lamb. The Feast of Pentecost was fulfilled with the giving of the Holy Spirit of God in Acts 2. The Feast of Booths or Tabernacles reminds us of God dwelling with His people. Ultimately, these feasts speak of God\u2019s faithfulness, sovereignty, and the need for community. They remind us of God moving throughout history on behalf of His people and Fernando does a great job of explaining that very truth.I highly recommend this commentary for all believers but especially for pastors. The outstanding exegesis, valuable application, and recommendations contained throughout on how pastors can share the underlying message found in Deuteronomy of loving obedience to a loving God is what makes this volume well worth the read. It will become a valuable tool for developing sermons not just on Deuteronomy itself, but also in regards to the many topics Deuteronomy touches on that are repeated throughout Scripture.

Basically all of the below still applies, don't remember if I noted the humor last time as much as this, because some of the exchanges, especially that Kate has at the end when she's freaking out\u2014so hysterical!! And is always a nice change when it's the hero who is in for the long haul and upfront about his feelings, as opposed to being a commitment-phobe, haven't read Roberts in a while, but if I remember correctly, that is more common with her heroes. Anyway, all around great read. Kind of wanted to slap Katie at the end there, but whatever.

Holding the Dream is book 2 in the Dream Trilogy and I haven't read - and don't plan on reading - book 1, just because Margo doesn't really appeal to me as a heroine. Kate was wonderful, however, and Byron was terrific - they were also great for one another, with Kate being so practical, logical, abrasive, etc. and Byron is smooth, a Southern-gentleman charmer, easy-going, friendly ... lol, they're just great together.

Unlike Margo's story, Kate's was such a fresh breath of air!In the second book of the Dream Trilogy, Kate Powell, Laura's cousin and the practical one of the trio, is having some health issues. Issues that she repeatedly ignores and makes worse. But her health isn't the only thing going downhill in her life currently. After finding out that her father stole from his company when he was alive, she takes an even bigger hit when she's reported for practically the same thing. As she's trying to bring her life back to its former balance, Kate is about to find out that not everything has to be part of a plan - and trusting her body in the very capable hands of Byron De Witt seems like the most logical first step.I have to say, I immensely enjoyed this one. Unlike Margo, Kate was spanky and feisty, with a good head on her shoulders and tons of dry wit in her arsenal. She didn't dream of fame and all that crap the blonde bimbo wanted, instead she wished for stability and intended to work hard to get it. Now that's the kind of female lead I can totally relate to in a book!Next to her, Byron was the perfect man to stand and thrive - seriously! Because the guy was no Josh! (yes, I hate Margo's man, too) He was sweet, and gentlemanly, and used his heart in wonderful equality with his mind. Not only that, but he was also man enough to let Kate take the reins when he saw it worked out better, and yet go all caveman on her when she crossed the line. He was perfection and then some! And when he seriously started courting her - honestly, there's no other way to put it, judging from what he did to and for her - I nearly melted on my seat!Together, they were a badass duo. He took care of her health and her relaxation, she made sure he wouldn't slack off - not that he often did. And they had so much in common, although it was subtle. I'm telling you, the perfect relationship! One that was meant to happen and spelled forever bright and clear! (if you're hesitant to believe me, just read this line of Byron's: \u201cYou're not beautiful, he said in a quiet statement that made her brow knit. Why do you look beautiful when you're not?\u201d - the man clearly loved her for what he saw inside, not because she was a fuckable piece of meat!)I'm so glad this wasn't like the first book. I wouldn't have been able to take it had it been the same disappointment the previous one proved to be... Now, to review the third one...\u201cI'm a mess. I'm insane.

            "Holding the Dream, the 2nd book in Nora Roberts Dream series continues with the story of Kate Powell, cousin and adopted daughter of the Templeton family.Kate is smart, focused, totally goal-orientated and practical and nothing like the beautiful and glamorous Margo, who we met in Daring to Dream, now happily married to Josh and expecting their baby and not a dreamer like the sweet Laura, who finally divorced her cheating and thief of a husband and struggling with bringing up her two beautiful daughters.Kate\u2019s work is her life \u2013 neat, tidy, organized - and is looking forward to her promotion in the auditing company she works for. So who cares that she forgets to eat or that she eats Tums like \u2026a lot of them. It\u2019s all part of her dream. Making the family proud of her accomplishments.Finding out the truth about her dead parents and accused of embezzling her clients, suddenly finds her world crashing around her.Trying to deal with all the fall-outs, she begins working at the boutique that she\u2019s a partner with Margo and Laura, and soon driving them crazy with her \u201cmanagement\u201d style of the store.

            "Orphan at a young age, Kate Powell was raised by her aunt and uncle, Susan and Thomas Templeton, the heads behind the Templeton hotel chain. They treated her like their own daughter and she never lacked for anything, but it left her with the feelings that she owe them everything and must always be the best. When the hardworking and pragmatic accountant suddenly find herself accused of commiting fraud by her employers, she find solace at Templeton House and Pretense, the retail store she co-own with her two best friends. And no one is more surprise than Kate herself to also find comfort in Byron De Witt's arms, Templeton latest manager. Byron see Kate as an enigma. One he intend to resolve and he doesn't hesitate to tell her. But he still can't understand why his attraction to her is so strong when she's the total opposite of his type. As for Kate, she sworn off men after an ex played her for a fool. The first time Kate met him, she found him annoying but it's only because she wasn't ready to deal with the awareness he make her feel, a strong feeling she never felt for any man before. But Byron will push down those walls with his understanding about Kate's prickly personality, her smart mind but her fear to show vulnerability. But the blunt woman who like to stay in control might be not as predictable as we thought and could still surprise everyone with her spontaneity. While I liked this book, I totally get why it was my least favorite of the series. Could be because at first, Kate and Byron was both more brainy characters (nothing wrong with that but I prefer when the MC have opposite personality traits), but it's also for the fact they didn't have Josh and Margo's history nor did I felt the same potent sexual tension between them as between Laura and Michael. Like Margo, Kate was not your typical perfect heroine. I understand why some people might think Kate's attitude was annoying but maybe it's easier for me to forgive her flaws because I saw myself in her outlook on life and love, like how she doesn't deal well with strong emotions and prefer to walk away than put up with the confrontation. To me, Byron was like an old-fashioned hero, you know, like the ones in those classical romance from the 1800 (you know the ones I'm talking about ,p) but he was not as stiff or too proper. So saying it was my least favorite does not mean I didn't have a great time with this book."

            "The theme of the Potter\u2019s Field is betrayal. The reference to the potter\u2019s field stems from the Gospels according to Matthew. When Judas returns to the priests the 30 pieces of silver he was paid for betraying Christ, they use them to purchase a potter\u2019s field, a burial ground for the indigent. When the Mafia deliberately slices the body of a traitor into 30 pieces, it is sending a warning message to others. In this context, Andrea Camilleri understands to mention Umberto Eco\u2019s theory of semiotics. Camilleri does not consider his detective series featuring Inspector Salvo Montalbano great literature, but he places the adventures in a broader cultural context. Thus, in the Potter\u2019s Field the author makes literary, artistic, and scholarly references not only to the Gospels and Eco, but also to Freudian dream interpretation, the painting \u201cThe Blind Leading the Blind\u201d by Pieter Bruegel the Elder, Dostoevsky\u2019s novels, a quote by Bertolt Brecht, Homer\u2019s Odyssey, Shakespeare\u2019s \u201cmethod in my madness,\u201d and Machiavelli\u2019s \u201cthe ends justify the means.\u201d He even playfully alludes to one of his own works. My dear erudite fellow-readers, is this an example of meta-fiction?",
            "Camilleri is an acquired taste. This one starts out in amusing fashion when Inspector Montalbano has to be driven to a suspected crime scene by Catarella who normally doesn't leave the police station. The sergeant can hardly move without breaking/falling over/banging into something. The pair pull up alongside the police Jeep and don't see anyone. Because it is pouring rain, the Inspector he really doesn't want to get wet tells Catarella to honk the horn but it doesn't work, so the two sit there waiting. Eventually Catarella offers to go look for the other officers, opens the car door, and promptly vanishes. Worried that Catarella has drowned, Montalbano gets out of the car and walks around to the driver's side where he finds himself in a freefall. When he gets to the bottom, he spots Catarella on the ground looking like a fresh mud sculpture. A few pages and a few slippery adventures later, they manage to locate the garbage bag which has moved as fast through the mud as they did containing a body cut into pieces.This series is set in Sicily so there is always a little corruption, the everpresent Mafia, lovely women and police of various sorts. Camilleri is quite expert at making it work. His photo at the beginning of the book shows a man in his seventies with a cigarette in his hand, scowling at the camera. As his aging hero Montalbano laments in this book, getting older isn't a lot of fun. But the food, wine and setting sure are for the reader."

            "If you're into stuff like this, you can read the full review.I always look forward to a novel by Andrea Camilleri. His Mediterranean sense of lightness, of the quirky fun of a life lived well is very hard to find in literature (I live in a Mediterranean country myself). This novel has everything I\u2019d expect, being situated in the Crime Fiction Landscape. But then, being a Camilleri novel, everything is different. It starts with a cut-up body, moves on to a missing husband, and then comes the Mafia. Upon finishing it, I was left with a vision of the sun, sea, nasty crimes, beautiful women, and pasta with sea urchins, which is pretty much what I remember from all of his novels. But what\u2019s important is not the plot. What really matters is what happens on the sidelines.You can read the rest of this review elsewhere.",
            "After a couple of meh entries, Andrea Camilleri returns with an award-winning volume of his series focusing on Inspector Salvo Montalbano, set in fictional Vigata, Sicily. This book opens with the usual comedy, then a murder, then comedy as his band of misfits operate like the Keystone Cops, ludicrous yet entertaining. . . . unless you have read thirteen of these books and you realize there is no character development except in the main character (who is grumpily aging and worried about it). So I thought at the first that it was just another ho hum book to read super fast, then began to see better writing and possibly deeper purpose. The crime solution itself is not memorable, but the meditations surrounding it are thoughtful and well done.The title Potter\u2019s Field is a reference to the story in the Gospel of Matthew, where Judas accepts thirty pieces of silver to betray Jesus. And a body is found in a muddy clay field (perfect for potters) cut into thirty pieces. Is it a mafia hit? And why is it Salvo\u2019s own Lieutenant Mimi Augello (the ladies man) wants to take over the investigation? Then Salvo finds that the man who was killed was the husband of a woman Mimi may be having an affair with. Betrayal of Mimi's wife? Of the police force? Of Salvo?This focus on betrayal works its way through the book on the large and small, public and personal level. And Camilleri weaves in more literary references than usual, from Shakespeare to Machiavelli. Salvo even makes playful reference to a Camilleri novel he has been reading, which is fun.Some popular phrases get repeated in every book, now multiple times: Everyone to Salvo his \u201cbusting his balls,\u201d Catarella says \u201c personally in person,\u201d Salvo \u201cpricks up his ears,\u201d when an interesting thing is said, in every book. If this gets tiresome, another theme in each book that is not so tiresome is the celebration of beautiful women, this time a Colombian woman who makes every man fall all over each other, in Buster Keaton fashion, fainting with admiration. Will every man betray his wife or or girlfriend with this woman? (Sad, deplorable. . . but have you seen her??!!) Is there something in the food or wine or the extreme heat that will lead to an answer?Ah yes, food. I wondered: Had anyone begun to write about the Sicilian food being described in each of these books, and sure enough, here\u2019s one (of many, I suspect) study from The Paris Review, complete with recipes:https://www.theparisreview.org/blog/2...Camilleri didn\u2019t even publish the first (of 26!) of these books until he (a famed stage director for most of his life) was sixty-nine, but at his death in 2019 (at the age of 94) was one of the most beloved public figures in Sicilian history, writing books that were attempts to entertain and prod readers to reflect on serious issues. He even took on the mafia and political corruption, a dangerous enterprise on that island. I didn\u2019t think the actual crime was equal to all the literary/philosophical/moral weight given to it, but this is better writing than usual in the series.",
            "Another neat trick by Camilleri. It seems so simple and obvious in the first part of the book, I wondered where the twisty subtlety had gone. Well, I found out it hadn't.  The subtly twisting heart of this book comes from the idea of betrayal, big and small, in private, public and police life, against others or oneself. Some so small as not to matter, others that can ruin a career or end a life. Or save any of these. Why on earth does a writer of Camilleri's gifts write mysteries - though I am so glad he does? How this writer/thinker moves from surface comedy into things so deep the soul begins to rise and the understanding of the world focuses just that little bit more, is beyond me. But he does it in simple vocabulary suitable to the genre. Beautifully enjoyable mysteries with equal amounts of puzzle, character, atmosphere, philosophy, intellectual history -- and escapism. Would that I could share Inspector Montalbano's veranda by the sea. His meals at Enzo's. His fertile brain. His capacity for coffee.  One of the best things about this Sicilian series is how un-Sicilian it is in terms of the established cliche. The mafia is there. And Montalbano is a cop. Yet much of his life is full of sky and sun and sea, of honest co-workers, and normally idiosyncratic people. All of which yields great plotting and reading. ",
            "Inspector Montalbano is getting older, closing in on 60. He is tired and achy but he still enjoys good food and wine. And he can still solve a complicated murder case because he is always thinking. He does multiplication tables when he is waiting. He uses Freud to interpret his dreams. He gives his boss statements to defend his actions using only the titles of Dostoevsky novels, knowing the commissioner will never pick up on it. He was too ignorant to have read them. A body is found in a muddy clay field cut into 30 pieces. Montalbano and his detectives must figure out the identity of the murder victim and who killed him. He connects the murder to biblical references and possible mafia involvement. And ultimately a link to one of his staff. This was one of Camilleri's best Montalbano mysteries to date. Not only a good mystery but with hilarious conversation between the characters. Sort of a cross between the Thin Man and the Sopranos. When Montalbano almost loses patience with a banker who hesitantly tells him a story. Montalbano senses a breaking in the general vicinity of his balls but he holds his temper as this later turns out to be a vital clue in his case. It never falls into slap stick, as there are dark moments as well. Molto Bene! ",
            "What's there not to love about this series? The food makes me salivate. The way he manages his team while playing pranks on them is inspirational. His constant battles with Livia humanize him and endears him. And on top of that, he's truly a brilliant man.A body, hacked into 30 pieces and placed in a black bag, is discovered when the heavy rains wash the soil away from the shallow grave. Mimi is acting very strangely and seems to be under a great deal of stress. An extremely sensuous Colombian woman seems to have all men who cross her path enthralled, including Montalbano. And what is murder in Sicily without the mafia being involved in some way?In this novel though, he's appearing wearier than usual and I'm afraid he's really going to make good on his threat to retire one day in the not too distant future. ",
            "series 8 episode 1 in 2011 did deliver this story to the small screen with Luca Zingaretti as Montalbaon in this long running TV series from Italy, when I say series I mean collection of TV movies that are generally excellently changed into TV movies rather faithful to the writing of Andrea Camilleri. When Montalbano wakes up it is not to the sound of the telephone heralding some awful crime, this time it is Caterella at his front door who is coming to take him to a body discovered in a Potters field, where the local man who found the package with body parts works and finds the clay he sells.Mimi and Fazio want him there and the weather, heavy rainfall, does nothing to improve Montalbano's mood.A second story line is Mimi having trouble with the relationship with a secret mistress and taking it out on the personal of the police station, which requires a lot of wheeling and dealing as Livia, the love of his life, is also meddling in the matter without knowing anything about a love affair.A third story line is the disappearance of an husband whose missing is being reported by his wife who of course is as beautiful as women can be.This book is easily one of the better Montalbano mysteries and in it we learn how well an investigator as master tactician is who does anything to protect his people, the story makes sense and is actually quite brilliant. An excellent instalment of the series and great fun to read."

            "While I have generally and indeed sometimes even absolutely loved the flavourful and scrumptious featured recipes of Kathy Patalsky's 365 Vegan Smoothies: Boost Your Health With a Rainbow of Fruits and Vegetables and have tried and also much enjoyed, savoured the majority of them over the past year or so, I simply cannot fully understand why almost ALL of the delicious (and nutritious) fruit and vegetable based concoctions usually tend to contain (sometimes copious amounts of) additional, of extra sweetener as part of the main list of ingredients (not white sugar, not honey perhaps, but really, even adding maple or agave syrup is only very marginally better than adding processed white cane sugar and still for all intents and purposes just a total carbohydrate spike with not much if any added nutrients). For honestly, since these smoothies are all and sundry fruit and vegetable based, they already and by necessity and nature do contain rather much naturally occurring simple sugars already and therefore (at least in my opinion), adding additional sweeteners will or at least should not be all that necessary, except for perhaps as a very rare treat, if one wants to imbibe a smoothie as a replacement for a sweet and decadent dessert. And personally, I have indeed generally omitted any or at least most of the additional sweeteners suggested in the 365 Vegan Smoothies recipes when I have made them for myself (for my personal consumption and enjoyment). And yes, I have generally found the end results not only exceedingly tasty but for my own private palate in fact considerably superior flavour-wise to the few times, I have actually followed the recipes to a T and have added the agave syrup, maple syrup etc. suggested by the author. I guess this is all first and foremost a matter of personal taste and personal likes, but really, considering that it is becoming more and more obvious and even scientifically proven that simple carbohydrates, that especially simple sugars are not only a major addiction, a major craving for many people, but also a real and problematic long term health concern and issue, in my own very humble opinion, I truly think that Kathy Patalsky should NOT have included agave syrup or other sweeteners in her 365 Vegan Smoothies as part of the main ingredients list (that she should have made ALL sweeteners, syrups and the like wholly and totally OPTIONAL, as that much added sugar should really not be promoted as being all that healthy, especially considering that 365 Vegan Smoothies very specifically claims to totally be thus).",
            "Great book! So many different smoothies, easy to make with easy to find ingredients, nutritional info for each recipe, great photos, a nice section with substitutions, etc!",
            "Smoothies, nom! :)One thing I always pay attention to in books is the formatting of the text - font, size, boldness, space-related formatting, etc.This book is formatted very well, so it makes it a delight to go through the pages. It provides an abundance of recipes and some instargammable photos of smooties - to boost your appetite. Can't wait to try more of them.There are 10 types of smoothie recipes included: Green smoothiesFrostyFrozenWhole food smoothiesGrain, nut or seed smoothiesProtein smoothiesShakesCooler or TonicCruncher smoothiesBasic smoothiesThe book is divided into 12 sections, each devoted to a different area of wellness: Detox, Energy, Slim down, Strengthening, Calming, Brain-boosting, Digestion, Healthy Heart, Anti-aging, Mood, Immunity, Beauty.Most of the recipes are with fruits and I'm more interested in veggie smoothies. I still find this book helpful - it gives lovely ideas. For example, the section for creative ice cubes was pleasing. There are some smoothie myths revealed too.We can debate if breakfast is the most important meal of the day - it depends on the person's habits. For me, it is true, but for my intermittent-fasting friends, it's not. Anyways, I'm sharing the argument about it:This is because it helps not only steady metabolism and replenishes one's energy stores, but also because healthy choices made early in the day will beget more healthy choices. Start your day with nutrient-dense vitamin-rich foods, and you'll be less likely to turn to junk foods.",
            "Love this book! I have found so many amazing recipes by Kathy. I love being inspired everytime I pull it off my shelf. ",
            "wonderful book. the best smoothie book I own, and I have a lot! so many flavor combinations I never even thought about!!",
            "Decent on ideas, most are not low calorie. It isn't a good idea to drink that much soy, unless you are trying to make hormonal changes and even then there is debate. Not all of the smoothies need nut milk either. Just extra calories in my opinion. But overall if I am trying to think of what to make its good enough for ideas. "

The place is a remote ranch where nothing is as it seems. You will know who the grand villain is about halfway through the book, but he has helpers, and those will keep you guessing until the end.

            "When Lindsey Hall's outrageous behavior causes more than a few political feathers to get ruffled, her father, the Vice President of the United States, seeks to have her committed to rehab once and for all. Sensing something more than a drug or alcohol addiction is the trouble with Lindsey he has her sent into seclusion under the watchful eyes of six Secret Service agents on a 100-acre ranch in the middle of Texas.Now all the agents need to do is make sure that while Lindsey is under going treatment for her addictions that they keep her safe as well. Seems since Lindsey's behavior has made the news channel there have been death threats issued against Lindsey. It seems they will stop at nothing to make sure that she is silenced one way or another, even if innocent people and agents die in the process.Special Agent Meghan Connors has a personal interest in wanting to see Lindsey make it through her rehab successfully. Her adopted sister also had substance abuse issues and between her and her mother, were always unable to get her to stay clean. Meghan believes that she can reach Lindsey where others have failed if only she can get her to open up and trust her. But it seems no matter how hard Meghan tries, Lindsey is keeping something hidden that she believes no one can stop.In charge of the operations at the Texas Ranch is Ash Zinders, whose abrasive personality doesn't seem to win him much favor from those that work with him. He is working on keeping Lindsey safe while on his watch and will stop at nothing to ensure that happens. Waiting for him if he succeeds in this endeavor is the promotion to protecting the president, and he won't let anything come between him and success, not even Meghan Connors, whom he feels is a wasted agent on this case. Ash feels that a women should never be allowed to work for the Secret Service since they are simply too big of a distraction to completing any mission.I received Attracted to Fire by DiAnn Mills compliments of Christian Fiction Blog Alliance for my honest review and must say I really enjoyed it. The entire time was spent trying to figure out, who did it and kept coming up short. Glad I don't work for the secret service! My favorite character is Meghan Connor and not just for the strong women character that comes across in the book. She does have a soft side but feels the need to keep that hidden especially when Ash makes his displeasure for her being on the case known. I think that would be difficult to keep up especially when on duty full time, secluded away at the ranch.For those of you that love criminal suspense mystery's, then this one is a must read for you. I rate this one a 4.5 out of 5 stars and look forward to more books from DiAnn in the near future.",

            "Secret Service Agent Meghan Connors is assigned to guard the rebellious drug and alcohol addicted daughter of the Vice President of the United States. But drug and alcohol are only the tip of the iceberg of Lindsay's problems as someone is forcing her to undermine her dad's policies by death and terror. This story sizzled with suspense and intrigue along with lots of possible suspects from start to finish. A plausible story line for this day and time when so many in government are not the trustworthy people they seem to be. Lots of great characters from the Secret Service team, to the ranch foremen, to Lindsay, the VP's daughter. I especially like the relationship between Meghan and Lindsay. Meghan's past gave her great insight into Lindsay's problems. The relationship between the Secret Service Team members was well developed and I particularly like how Ash learned to overcome his prejudice against women in the Secret Service and gain respect for Meghan's abilities. Their growing relationship was well developed too. I did figure out who was behind everything about halfway through the book but that didn't keep me from enjoying the remainder. Recommended for fans of Dani Pettrey, Irene Hannon, and Dee Henderson.FAVORITE QUOTES: Unhappiness leads to coping mechanisms that have the potential to kill us.It takes realization that God is always in charge, and He will heal our hurts if we let Him.Ignoring God gives man a one-way ticket to heat hotter than Texas. So don't be tellin' me I can be goin' .(to church)**I received a complimentary copy of this book to review. I was asked to give my honest opinion of the book - which I have done.",
            "Meghan Connors has been assigned to the Secret Service detail of Lindsey Hall, the alcoholic and drug-addicted daughter of the Vice President of the United States. As the only female on the team, she has to battle the prejudices of Ash Zinders, the Special Agent In Charge, who is famous both for his attention to detail (his nickname is \u2018A2Z\u2019), and for his belief that women do not belong in the Secret Service. However, death threats and a series of inexplicable incidents at their supposedly confidential location mean they have to work together to protect Lindsay from an unknown fear that is bigger than her addiction problems.I really enjoyed Attracted to Fire. I would have read it all in one sitting, except that actually had some paid work to do, so I managed to put that first \u2013 then raced home and cooked dinner so I could read more. Attracted to Fire had excellent characters, good pace, and some real suspense, particularly around the nature of Lindsay\u2019s fear, and (once this was disclosed) how the characters were going to overcome the person who was conspiring to bring down the presidency by manipulating Lindsey. There was also the growing romantic relationship between Meghan and Ash - despite their efforts to the contrary. The story had an underlying Christian tone, but this formed a backdrop to the main plot rather than being the central theme.I have read several previous books by Diann Mills, including Breach of Trust (my personal favourite), which won the 2010 Christy Award for Romantic Suspense. Attracted to Fire is not quite as good as Breach of Trust \u2013 but it is close, and it is probably the best romantic suspense novel I have read this year (which is a lot more of a big deal in September than it would have been in March, for example!) Although I received a free ebook version of Attracted to Fire (courtesy of Tyndale House Publishers and NetGalley), I have also ordered it in hard copy \u2013 to reread my favourite parts, and for my friends to borrow\u2026",
            "Attracted to Fire is another of DiAnn Mills riveting c0ntemporary novels that feature various branches of law enforcement. In this one, the primary characters Meghan Connor and Ash Zinders are special agents in the Secret Service. The pair meets when they are both assigned to protect the Vice President's daughter as she once again goes through drug and alcohol rehab because of repeated threats to her life.Because of past events, hard-nosed Ash has no use for female agents on his team and is unhappy with Meghan's assignment. As dangerous incidents escalate, Meghan demonstrates her skill, insight, and dedication time and again. Not only does Ash begin to change his mind about her value to the team but begins to view her in an even more personal light.With expertly developed plot and characters, Attracted to Fire kept me turning the pages. The story contained ample action, danger, suspense, and drama to hold my interest and the romantic elements were an added bonus. Twists and surprises abound. Although the person behind the threats is revealed to the reader fairly early in the narrative, it is still interesting to learn how the agents finally solve the identity of the culprit and accomplices.I recommend Attracted to Fire as well as the other novels of DiAnn Mills.This book was provided for review by Tyndale House and NetGalley.",
            "This was my first book by this author and I was not disappointed. This book had me turning pages and holding my breath to find out what happened next.What I Liked: I liked the two main characters. They were very detailed and I grew to like the gruff Ash\u2014knowing he had a story behind his short and to the point attitude.I guessed who was behind everything right before the book stated who it was, but I won\u2019t tell you if I was right or not. There are lots of twists and throughout the reading of it I couldn\u2019t wait to get to the end so that justice would be put into place.What I Didn\u2019t Like: I can\u2019t remember much that I disliked, but I wouldn\u2019t recommend this story for teens as this book deals with some heavier topics.I give this book 4 stars for a good suspenseful story."

I would not read this book for story time, but I would read it one-on-one with caregiver's discretion. Some kids may have lost their grandparent or not even have one, so it is important to ask caregiver's permission before reading the book. I would read this book to little ones, but no older than 2nd grade. The illustrations are lovely and simple, which I liked.

The grandpa either has Alzheimer's or dementia, resulting in them getting lost or forgetting who their grandchild is from time to time. Readers will enjoy the playful illustrations in the face of a tough topic and the emphasis on the importance of love. However, there isn't representation of the anger and frustration that those suffering from Alzheimer's or dementia express, which could give an idealized picture where the grandchild makes everything better with love and hugs. Conversations will need to follow with the child, but this book will help facilitate that. For: readers wanting a book to help discuss old age, Alzheimer's, or dementia.Possible red flags: an aging loved one, Alzheimer's or dementia (not being recognized by a loved one)."

            "Very sweet story for Leo and Stuart. However, the writing suffers from lack of editing and fact checking:- Sentence such as Micah sighed, took out his wallet and gave Micah a five. from the very first page made the reading confusing, and gave a bad impression from the beginning. (Other thing I remember was a HOi instead of Hi somewhere)- Repeated mention of swimming in the Thames. I don't personally know of the condition of the Thames is in Chiswick, but what I know of the river in London is that sewage gets dumped into it, and it has busy traffic. - A comment by Dune at the airport suggested that they were using euros for their time in London. Again, never tried this myself (considering since some major stores have euros on their price tag), but with how confused the cashier gets when handed Scottish pounds, I cannot imagine them being happy when given euros....those are the most glaring points that remember. Lets continue with something more pleasant.Similar to Micah in the previous book, it was great to see how the main characters grew throughout the story (for me, the award gotta go to Stuart though). The interactions between Leo and Stuart were believable, and made you appreciate how the two could enrich each other's life. The main characters from the previous books also featured heavily in this one. I'm glad to see Dune recovering from the end of the previous book, and Micah was still being his awesome self.(Browser crashed, then GR error page? It's like this book doesn't want to be reviewed)",

            "This was so well done. A girl is looking at this book in the library about the coral reefs. As she is reading it, her imagination takes over and all these facts about the ocean begin to appear and the room fills with water and she and her book are swimming all over the ocean. We learn about fish cities, the coral reefs and how they house most of the life in the ocean. This book is packed with facts and we see how it all looks in the head of the girl.I like that when she is done, she is wet on the steps of the library and all the kids want to read the book for the experience. It\u2019s a wonderful blend of whimsy and how coral reefs work. It\u2019s a great way to tell a serious story. The nephew was even interested in this story. He thought it would be cool if the library filled with water like that. I said it would ruin all the books and he looked at me and said it\u2019s all pretend, silly. He would like to go scuba diving someday. He gave this 4 stars. He thought the sharks were a bit scary. ",
            "An effective and novel introduction to the nature and ecology of coral reefs, Coral Reefs which has been both written and illustrated by Jason Chin, is both engaging and informative, presenting not only general and specific information and details about coral reef communities and their environs, but also demonstrating the unfortunate fact, the unfortunate truth that coral reefs are not only vibrant and diverse marine communities, but that many of these communities are increasingly being endangered by and through human encroachment, overfishing, pollution, climate change etc.Now the entire concept of Coral Reefs, of a young girl going to the library to read a book about coral reefs and then having both herself and her surroundings (her local library, her local city) literally become part of a coral reef community is quite visually stunning (and some of the illustrations, some of the scenes feel almost reminiscent of a lost city under the sea, like Atlantis). However, first and foremost, Jason Chin's gloriously bright, descriptive pictures provide not only a successfully rendered mirror of and to the presented narrative, they also reiterate one of the main messages, one of the main points of Coral Reefs, namely that coral reef communities are in many ways like huge, underwater cities. And like our own cities, these coral reefs, while vibrant, diverse, and constantly on the move, are also vulnerable and can be threatened by both natural and man-made, artificial phenomena. And finally, regard to age suitability, the actual text of Coral Reefs is pretty dense, wordy and rather involved, and I would therefore tend to recommend this book more for older children above the age of six or even seven. For while I do in fact believe that even younger children would likely enjoy the brightly descriptive illustrations, the narrative flow is definitely a bit slow moving and detailed at times (and thus might be a bit distracting and difficult for the very young, not to mention that the featured threats encountered by coral reefs are or at least could be a bit hard for toddlers, for children up to the age of six or so to adequately fathom and comprehend)."
        ],
        "positive_reviews": [
            "First things first. Let's just get something out the way here before I go any further. I am not exactly a disinterested party when it comes to this book. No, I don't know the author personally (though we did meet once). No, I never saw an early manuscript or offered helpful criticisms when the text was still young and unformed. No, I am not a coral reef myself. See, the thing about this book is that it takes place at a very specific location. The bulk of the story happens when a kid enters a library. And not just any library. My library. And by my I don't mean my local branch. I mean my employer. So you see, I'm not sure I can be trusted to review this with an impassive eye. There's something that makes a gal go all giddy when a book features her place of work. Never mind that Chin has already established himself as a master of the magical realism nonfiction form (see: Redwoods) or that the book covers material rarely presented in such an imaginative fashion. Nonfiction books for kids are usually such dull, dry affairs. Clearly an author has to get a little bit wet sometimes to make them interesting. And compromised though I might be, I'm recommending this puppy with all my heart.A girl stands in a library room and removes a book from a shelf entitled Coral Reefs. As she reads we see the text below each image. The book explains how reefs are formed, who lives in them, and what their future may be. As we read along we see the girl's library suddenly flooded. New York City is now underwater and the girl observes firsthand the lagoons, the feeding grounds, and the food chain at work. By the end she stands on the library steps utterly wet, and some other kids get to read the book world beneath the sea for themselves. The back of the book features an author's note on the threats the coral reefs now face as well as additional facts and a small bibliography of useful books and websites.The Stephen A. Schwarzman branch of New York Public Library (better known to the bulk of the world as the library with the big stone lions out front) has appeared in various works of children's literature for years. From a significant appearance on the dedication page of James Daugherty's Andy and the Lion to the The Inside-Outside Book of Libraries (by former NYPL employee Julie Cummins, no less) to Hilary and the Lions by Frank Desaix, there is no end to the number of titles that have displayed it in some way. Of course, only a few of those books actually give glimpses of the inside of the library itself. This book not only glimpses the inside, it fills it with saltwater. I expect a lot of kids are going to find our rooms a bit disappointing after they go on the oceanic journey of Coral Reefs first.Naturally Chin spoke about this book in my library not that long ago to two classes of second and third graders. Lest you believe kids of that age range cannot take interest in anything that doesn't involve princesses or Star Wars characters, allow me to say that the children who saw the man speak took in, processed, and retained the information here. After reading the book and explaining how he wrote it he asked the kids what it is that parrotfish eat. When he called on a girl with her hand in the air she said, with no hesitation, Polyps. I exchanged glances with the grown-ups seated around me. Heck, I couldn't have told him that and I'd been listening the whole time. Kids: 1. Grown-up librarians: Zip Zero Zilch. Now I should note that the text in this book is very straightforward. The girl's journey doesn't enter into it. Chin is telling you about coral reefs straight on without prettying it up or doing much more than giving you the facts of the matter. Be aware.When a kid gets an assignment in school to do a report on coral reefs, they're going to go to their local library looking for one of those perfectly nice but relatively dull books with lots of information and the occasional photograph of an octopus or a grouper. Chin's idea to couple his facts with a kid exploring them firsthand was one he used to great effect in the previous book Redwoods. Like this book, that one showed a kid reading a book in a New York City (in that case, on a subway), emerging from the station into a world of enormous trees. Here our heroine is in NYPL's Rose Reading Room (meticulously and accurately rendered) when she is swept into an underwater world. For the images Chin uses the most delicate of watercolors. He's a master of them too. It can be no easy task to show what the underside of the ocean looking up might be, or to pinpoint what shadowed underwater light looks like. From the endpapers of the fishies to the animals you spot around the reef, Chin has taken his time with this book to make it absolutely marvelous. I think it took me several readings before I realized that like the squirrel companion in Redwoods, here we have a crab companion for our heroine who crops up in various pictures from time to time.I once gave a tour of the Rose Reading Room (the place where everything in this book starts) to a group of kids familiar with this book. I led the kids to the place where the book occurs so that they could stand there themselves. I held up the images, drawing the attention of children and tourists alike. If there is a flaw in the book it's that it shows the girl getting this very same book out of the Reading Room to read. That is untrue. To read this book you will have to go three floors down and enter the Children's Center. There you will find a copy ready and waiting for you. A copy that will tell you everything you ever wanted or needed to know about the vast, amazing, entrancing world of coral reefs and the creatures that make it their home. Gorgeous work. Great facts. A singular title.For ages 5 and up. ",
            "Like Chin\u2019s book Redwoods, this book has a fictional story within the non-fiction book and marvelous illustrations. When a young girl in the NYC public library pulls a book about coral reefs (this very one) off the shelves and reads it, she falls right into the book, into the coral reef. The page where this first happens elicited a huge smile from me, that illustration is so much fun.There are many interesting facts about coral reefs but even in the book proper, the information detail and vocabulary have me thinking this is for readers 9 and up. Younger children who have interest in marine biology and coral reefs might enjoying viewing the book and having it read to them, but I think it will best be appreciated by those 9-13.There is a two page spread in the back that has additional information with great emphasis on how coral reefs are vulnerable and about some ways humans can protect them. The author is definitely ecologically minded. He reveals in his author\u2019s note how as part of research for this book he traveled to the Belize barrier reef. (Lucky man, who made the most of it, and gave back to his readers.) He also lists books and websites he used.",
            "Great illustrations, along with interesting descriptions of coral reefs and the animals that depend upon them. Includes several animals that I'd never heard of (such as the frogfish and the scorpion fish). My kids were both fascinated by and disgusted by the neon gobies that eat parasites and dead skin off of tiger groupies. The gobies even swim inside the groupers' mouths to clean their teeth. A great example of a symbiotic relationship. The book compares coral reefs to cities...great cities under the sea. The book includes some additional notes on coral reefs, including the threats to them and how we can protect them, the partnership between the coral polyps and their algae, and a note about his research. Well written, this held the interest of my 7 and 9 year old completely and my 4 year old paid attention through most of the book (but then wandered off to play quietly with barbies, still listening but not looking at the pictures any more).Could be used to discuss coral reefs, symbiotic relationships, animal adaptations, the food chain, and conservation. ",
            "We recently read Redwoods by Jason Chin and we really liked it. I love the way that the book informs but still tells a secondary story through the illustrations. So when we saw this book about coral reefs, we just knew we had to read it. The story is long and the information is fairly detailed, so I would recommend this for older children. But, as we saw withRedwoods, the colorful illustrations are absolutely gorgeous. They create an underwater world right inside the Stephen A. Schwarzman branch of the New York Public Library. At the end of the story we even see the famous library lions, Patience and Fortitude as the little girl shares her discovery with some other children. We loved the details, especially the ocean-themed designs in the ceiling and the sushi restaurant. The additional information about the threat to coral reefs is very enlightening and explains what children can do to help the environment. This story was selected as one of the books for the September 2012 - Ecosystems reads at the Picture-Book Club in the Children's Books Group here at Goodreads. ",
            "Using the similar combination of nonfiction and magical realism as he did in Redwoods (Flash Point, 2009), Chin presents a beautiful look at the ecosystem of coral reefs. A girl enters the New York Public Library and pulls out a book from the shelves, careful readers will note that she selects this same book, Coral Reefs.xa0 Soon, coral begins to grow around her on the tables and the floor. Water puddles appear on the floor. A crab scurries past. Suddenly, a wave crashes through the window and sweeps her away, filling the library with water, animals and of course the ever-growing coral. As the illustrations carry this magical story, the text presents straightforward nonfiction narration about the ecosystem of coral reefs. The information is clear, but without typical features of nonfiction text like section headings, captions and definitions, the text is best for children who are already quite familiar with the topic. All readers, however, will be enchanted and engrossed by Chin\u2019s vibrant, detailed watercolors. The rich hues, dominated by the turquoise water and the colorful fish, pull readers into the ocean world."

            "Another atrocious piece of garbage to add to the Deadpool pantheon. I had higher hopes for this one, since it starts off with a decent premise (Deadpool has been institutionalized and is being treated for his particular breed of insanity).

They abandon that plotline pretty hard for, oh, the 1000th story about a woman who falls head over heels in love with Deadpool for no discernible reason other than that he is a man and they are needy/crazy. Also, for good measure, Deadpool beats her up a couple of times because he isn't interested in her! So, if you were hoping for a hilarious romp about a man beating a defenseless woman because she is too ugly, here's your book!If you have ever thought comics don't have a woman problem, please read this and explain to me why any of the way this character is treated is ok. She's introduced as Deadpool's psychiatrist, who plans on using innovative techniques to cure him of his mental illness. Ok, fine. But then, right out of the gate, every man in the comic starts talking about how ugly and fat she is? Seriously, almost every man comments on her looks. It's presented as a joke of some sort, but it made me physically angry. I was hoping there'd be some sort of redemptive moment that made all these weird jokes okay, but there isn't. It turns out she's actually just completely insane, which I guess is meant to make us retroactively say Sure am glad they made fun of how fat she is (the artist's version of fat is just a normal human woman, by the way).Oh, and the hitting. Deadpool kicks this woman at one point because she dares to hit on him. Then, later, he punches her because she tries to kiss him. There's a weird scene where she goes to the hospital and a doctor asks her if she has an abusive boyfriend, and she says Yes and then just leaves to go find Deadpool again. I think the point of this scene, however, is to further establish how crazy she is for thinking that Deadpool is her boyfriend, rather than deal with the fact that this woman (who is not a superhero or fighter or anything!) has been beaten up by a man.This, along with David Lapham's completely atrocious Deadpool Max, are seeking to permanently tarnish my view of this character. I mean, I can't really get behind a guy who beats up defenseless women (or any defenseless person at all, for that matter) and then expects me to laugh at his stupid burrito joke two seconds later. I'm trying to just view this as the fault of a few (impossibly shitty) writers, but it's getting to be kind of hard to do. Marvel continually allows Deadpool to function as one of the most vile characters in comics, and yet we're still supposed to root for him. I'll finish the Deadpool comics I already own in hopes that this stuff goes away, but if I get through them and this hasn't made a drastic improvement, I'm done with this character forever. Thanks for ruining something that was once great, Marvel.",
            "After the Hulk doesn't kill Wade, Deadpool is brought up on charges and defended by Jennifer Walters (She Hulk). Unable to be housed in The Raft because of a technicality, Wade is instead sent to a mental institution for superhumans and is placed under the care of Dr. Ella Whitby. I didn't enjoy this book at all. Like most of Way's Deadpool run, it isn't funny in the slightest. Most of the jokes revolve around Whitby's figure and appearance. She's not drawn particularly big (yes, she is plump, especially in this comic where Jennifer is drawn with boobs that defy gravity and wearing to court a skirt so short that you can almost see her butt), but she looks rather average, which somehow translates into hideously ugly for most of the characters in the book. And even though Deadpool is hideously ugly due to his scars and his healing factor taking on his cancer, it's let's make ugly and fat jokes about the slightly overweight doctor-palooza. No thanks.Getting really tired of your sh!t, Marvel. No wonder I don't read many superhero comics anymore.",

            "If I told you that Deadpool was in a mental hospital, and his psychiatrist is an unhinged woman who falls in love with him you might reasonably assume that it was the title engaging in some of it\u2019s typical meta-satire of the genre to poke a little fun at DC\u2019s Harley Quinn, right?Unfortunately, instead of doing anything clever the entire story is an extended gag about how she\u2019s not a supermodel so DP finds her disgusting. This is a guy whose face would let him play Freddy Kruger without using make-up, and he was recently hooking up with a disgusting alien during his space adventure. But hey, this chick is UGLY! They could have done something with this if they would have played up the angle of it being a twisted version of the Harley/Joker story, or if the main point was that this woman is just too crazy even for Deadpool. That\u2019s actually touched on, but you always get the impression that if this lady was hotter than DP would be totally into the whole thing. Even though there\u2019s actually a few good moments where the shrink is making some valid observations about DP\u2019s mental state it\u2019s all tossed aside for the lazy and cheap stuff.Disappointing.",

But... while not being as funny as the staple Daniel Way Deadpool story, this actually echoes WAy's other explorations of MArvel's psyches, namely that of Wolverine. Way gets into Deadpool's head while throwing at him an fugly(I don't see it. Blame the artist. He's too good to make a chick ugly) professor of psychiatry who's hell bent on curing Deadpool.

            " Deadpool has been sent to a maximum security prison where he's being held in the psychiatric ward. His doctor, Dr Whitby, thinks she can save him. She tells him that she became a doctor because of his case and wants to help him get better. Her treatments seem to help but are also making Deadpool really sleepy and unresponsive. When he first arrived at the prison Deadpool thought the other inmates were laughing at his scars so he best all of them up and secretly damaged the face of one of them. That guy ends up getting reconstructive surgery. Whitby spends most of her time trying to fix Deadpool and that makes the prisoner with the facial injuries jealous because he's in love with her. He's also upset because he's up for parole and he wants to stay in prison to be closer to Whitby. He takes out his anger on Deadpool.The guy gets paroled and Deadpool is sent to solitary confinement. When Whitby goes to check on Deadpool she immediately realizes something is wrong and runs out of the prison after the recently paroled prisoner. She throws herself at him and confesses her undying love...to Deadpool. Since they both wore masks (Whitby let Deadpool wear his to hide his scars), the two of them easily switched places and got what they wanted. Deadpool soon realizes that Dr Whitby is seriously unhinged, not just because she loves him but also because she wants to be like him and had been going around murdering people. Deadpool tries to get away from her but she finds him, revealing herself in an unflattering Deadpool costume. He goes to her apartment after she leaves for work to find some proof that she's a murderer and finds his own body parts -- enough to make another Deadpool -- chilling in the fridge. Totally freaked out, Deadpool goes to stop Whitbys plan to kill the persons Warden. She gets blown up by her own hand but somehow survives the blast. When Deadpool tells her he loves someone else she shoots herself in the head and dies. Deadpool throws out his assortment of body parts."

            "Dittkos Spider-Man has shaped my childlike idea of \u200b\u200bsuperhero comics, and as a recent Doc Ock acted as a Spidey, I had to raise a lot of tolerance, not to pay out the idea of \u200b\u200bthe idea as absurd. According to me, first, the question of whether I really want to read the Ultimate Spider-Man. As you know, Marvel has started this series to modernize the Stories of the Old Haudegen and make them accessible to today's, no longer so childlike / childish audience, and then above all, too, to stabilize the sales figures in a difficult phase, if not to increase. In the last night, it was Bendis' name that had to grab me to this omnibus, and I did not regret it. Afterwards showed it over four decades, in which direction the journey would go, Bendi's Peter Parker's history was aimed at Tampled new to tell, to avoid dead ends and redundancies and prepare the teeth to the modern marvel universe. The Cold War, Vietnam and Communist Angest were eradicated, as well as other denominations, which were arrested to the 1960s. Bendi's character has held at Peter Parker's character, the The insecure high school student stays and at least so much with his private life struggling like as a spider -Man with the bad guys, a sympathetic, tragic teenager, with which young people can identify today. The school and the Bullies have changed, of course, but the mood situation has remained largely the same. MJ and Gwen have had to swap their roles and the fighting with the most balancing super scores will be spidely spared (one of my favorite scenes is that, as a spidey again a lot too late appears to stop a super scores and Iron you've been donoring that you have long been constant Everything again: humor, tragedy, also a portion of pathos, and of course tension. Above all, Spidey has always been the humanest of all superheroes, and that's exactly what he stays with Bendi's happiness too. Mark Bagley's drawings go little to the cartoon-like, but just in this way it succeeds great to conjure emotions in the faces of our heroes . And at all, his page division is convincing and has its own narrative rhythm, sometimes slowly when it comes to important dialogues, then quickly and interlocking when hard action is pending. I also liked the coloring very much, which wants to mean a lot in a SW fan. Only the cover did not like it at all. They convey nothing from the charm, which the artwork has in the stuck.",
            "Not a big Spidey fan, but I have loved a lot of Bendis's stuff(Torso, Daredevil, Powers) in the past so I gave this a shot. Really struggled with all of the teen angst. Probably would have enjoyed this more in the 90's. Definitely getting old. Mark Bagley does a decent job with the artwork, but not enough for me to strongly recommend this title to anyone who isn't a Spiderman fan. ",
            "As a mediocre fan of graphic novels and a 80\u2019s child it was cool to read through this reboot Omni-bus. I enjoyed the back story and behind the scenes info as much if not more than the actual story line. This feels like the best way to read comics to me, the full story in one edition with author\u2019s notes and drawings. I have really come to love this version of the Spider-Man universe over all others and that is largely due to reading this collection.",
            "Taken as a whole this a superb run, not least because of its sheer length. Clocking in at around 150 issues, it's difficult for anything to keep up anything approaching such a high level of quality. The other Ultimate tentpoles are good in most places: Fantastic Four, X-Men, even Ultimates to some extent, and they all have at least one thing in their armoury which Spiderman doesn't: numbers. Here, it's pretty much just Spidey as a constant lead, which simply makes his continued appeal - with apologies to Xavier's school - astonishing.So, during the course of this you get a speedy origin story, Peter Parker's closely protected home life, a rolling array of villains major and minor, and a gradual and credible interweaving of other Marvel stalwarts. There are a few things however which elevate this above perhaps any of its stablemates.First, Parker's enemies are pretty much all products of his own life (with the exception of Vibro, who hilarious pops up every so often only to be slapped down effortlessly). They overlap with his history, his family's history, and his own mistakes and triumphs. This grounds the comic book unreality, and instantly open the door to powerful allegories. What comes back to haunt him, whether deserved or not, resounds in his personal life as well as the pugilism of the heroics. Some of it is absurd - the Sinister Six don't exceed the sum of their parts, and by the end I'd even had it up to here with Otto Bloody Octavius and his Fucking Metal Arms That Won't Die.Second, he is a smart kid. The story doesn't shy away from the fact that Parker cherishes his not quite genius-level intellect even though on the surface his powers are basically super-athleticism. And with the smart comes the tragedy of the Spiderman: the recognition of a responsibility to do what you can with the powers available to you. If only there were a snappy aphorism to convey that.Third, the lines spark with zing and sass, beyond any top bantz which Johnny Storm and the Thing can produce with the possible exception of Dude, you fantasti-suck... The supporting characters feel real, and the writers capture the speedy if not entirely profound wit of the highschooler.Fourth, its about youth, and the painful desire to cling to innocence as well as an urge to develop maturity. There are plenty of sexy bodies on display, some absurd and sexist along the way, but perhaps (I can't say) balanced by a fair share of opportunity to ogle the Spiderman physique. The girls in his life are minor roles, but then again so are the boys, and at least the girls fight their own good fights.Fifth, his internal monologues save pretty much any story, by turns undercutting the ridiculousness and pomposity of villains, breathing life into exposition, and just riffing off whatever came into the writer's head.Sixth, the Marvel heavyweights who crop up - Fury, mutants, Fantastic Four, Ultimates - do so pretty much always in service of Spiderman's storyline, and while it feels like a definite power up when they share the action, they work alongside him to varying extents in a way that never feels crowbarred in.It's a long read, and best taken at a run, but it's never les than fun, warm-hearted and willing to treat its youthful leads seriously.

            "Ultimate Spider-Man Omnibus Vol.1!!! I know, I know, I'm late to the news. Frankly, I'm not really much of a fan of Peter Parker/Spider-Man. Looking at my collection, I have more books on Venom, Carnage, Spider-Man (Octavius), heck, I even have 1 Spider-Man (Ben Reilly)(though unfortunately, I have yet to encounter a good collection of Spider-Man 2099). Anyway, I've been hearing such great reviews about Ultimate Spidey, and I found an Omnibus edition on sale some weeks back, so here we go! Being part of the Marvel Ultimate timeline, this is an updated re-telling of Parker's story. The Peter here is a 15-year-old nerd high school student, already best friends with MJ, and working as a IT/Tech-support for the Daily Bugle. We also get revamped origin stories for his menagerie of villains! Venom is a synthesized genetic suit, Kraven is a reality TV celebrity (a la Steve Irwin), and Doc Oct and Green Goblin were results in the same accident when they were trying to replicate Spidey's case on Norman Osborn. It all feels like a fun coming-of-age story for Peter, with a different perspective than what we were used to. You see him dealing with high school romance, living with Gwen Stacy (who's a punk girl, with daddy issues), getting a job to support Aunt May, or even just simply having problems escaping school to go save the day. Reading this series feels like reading an old favorite, yet finding something new with each page. It has good pacing that would have you continuously engaged or interested. But boy, Peter really doesn't get a break in this one. It's one event after another with him.Ooohhh... Didn't know that this started the whole Ultimates series. Wonder if/when the 2nd volume will come out?",
            "This omnibus is really good. Great story arcs, phenomenal writing, and awesome art from start to finish. This story essentially recreates spiderman within 21st century America. Bendis puts parker in somewhat more believable settings and circumstances for a 15 year old high school kid. The characters throughout have their own unique persona and traits which makes things really work well in this run. My only gripe is that there is not another continuing omnibus to complement this one. Ultimately though, Bendis has created something really special here. "

All it had left were desperate measures--commando raids, intelligence coups, feats of derring-do. Any such novel enterprise, wrote Admiral John Godfrey, Director of Naval Intelligence, required an officer with drive and imagination of the highest order. He found one in Commander Ian Fleming.,In ,Ian Fleming's Commandos,, Nicholas Rankin tells the exciting story of a secret intelligence outfit conceived and organized by Fleming. Named 30 Assault Unit, the group was expected to seize enemy codebooks, cipher machines, and documents in high-stakes operations. Assault unit commandos fought in the North African campaign and the invasions of Sicily and Italy, poked over the bones of bombed Pantelleria, and liberated Capri. Rebranded '30 Assault Unit', they went ashore on D-Day, heading for rocket-sites and radar-stations. They helped liberate Paris (including the Ritz Bar and the Rothschild mansion) and then set out to steal scientific and industrial secrets from the heart of Germany.

            "This book supposedly tells the story of an Assault Unit founded predominantly due to the promptings of Ian Fleming - the man who went on to write the James Bond books.That's what it says on the blurb anyway - what it actually does in reality is anyone's guess.Firstly and foremostly, this is an incredibly poorly edited book.Compared to the likes of Ben Macintyre, Stephen Ambrose and Cornelius Ryan, who already occupy the space that this author is trying to co-habit, this is very poor fare indeed. The three champions of the genre manage to weave diligent research into coherent, readable narrative, this offering by Nicholas Rankin splutters like a misfiring engine. Every once in a while, a very readable piece of narrative prose appears, which just about drags this book from the very bottom of the barrel, but far too often the narrative is at best disjointed, with one paragraph bearing little relation to what has preceded it, or to what follows it, at worst, it simple becomes elongated bullet points, facts fired staccatto at the reader, leaving him slightly bemused, confused and often utterly bored.On at least three different occasions, long inventories of almost half a page appear in the book - a simple umbrella term such as German manufacturing output would have sufficed every time. I compared two of the lists - they were around 66% identical. I lost the will to make any further comparisons. The plot jumps, often completely inexplicably, to an entirely disconnected set of facts - and that is what a lot of this book is - quite simply, a lot of facts that have been put down in virtual note form, then copied on to a page with little or no effort to make them attractive to the reader -leaving you with the sense that there are some interesting stories to tell here - if only a bit more effort had been made to tell them interestingly.The author also tries to weave references from war events into reasons behind events in some of Fleming's novels - but the following passage sums up the strain the reader is put under with some of this cross referencing....A Canadian scientist....called Dr CH Noton seems to have been a source of complaint about 30AU. If Ian Fleming heard about it, it is possible that the name may have later resurfaced...as Dr No. An equally feasible explanation might have been that Fleming went to his doctor, asked him for a prescription, and the Dr said No. My imaginary explanation would appear to be based on as much fact as the authors' - though arguably my explanation is a little more realistic. These annoying flights of fantasy pepper the book liberally - and make an already frustrating read even more annoying.A good editor really should have sifted a lot of these fundamental weaknesses out - but if this had been edited diligently, I wonder if there would have been very much left?

            "This book tells what Ian Fleming did before he wrote the James Bond books, and shows the influence his years as a spy had on the books he wrote. He helped to organize a British commando unit during World War II whose job it was to collect intelligence. The small groups often went into battle zones and behind enemy lines and collected literally tons of information during the war. Among other things, this unit helped the allies crack the German Enigma systems for sending coded messages. If you can't find out what the enemy is doing you're fighting with a blindfold. As an aside, the wife of a friend of mine worked with Fleming. The friend once tried to get her to tell some of the things she did and she freaked out. Spies were restricted in what they could talk about by the Official Secrets Act and similar laws, and woe betide those who spoke out of turn."

            "This was an interesting book, if a little bit scattered now and then.In essence, it's the story of how one Ian Fleming, using his charm and wit and fascination with gadgets, managed to help fight the war of bureaucracy on the Royal Navy and successfully create a force of commandos, tasked with gathering German military secrets and ciphers during the big push by the Allied forces in the West throughout 1942-1945.Following early intelligence blunders in Norway and France, the British military establishment figured they needed a different approach to major offensives. Hence, the idea of deep-penetration intelligence-and-reconnaissance teams is born. SBS, SAS and 30 AU are the result of these bloody lessons, and the book focuses mostly on the last. The early missions are in North Africa and Sicily, and there, the commando learn the hard lessons, but then, they become an efficient and effective force after the Normandy landings.The bulk of the book deals with the last year of the war, following the 30 AU through France and Germany, and it's a very compelling piece of work - full of anecdotes, absurdities of war, daring missions, crazy situations, and curious people - a German general who wears a Scottish kilt, Ernest Hemingway getting drunk in Paris, Churchill taking a wee in the Rhine, a buxon freulein trying to set fire to the Kreigsmarine archive and being threatened with spanking, art and booze being stolen, tiny units forcing the surrender of large armies, the hunt after Nazi criminals, and more.The backdrop to this story is Ian Fleming. He is a curious character.An egocentric megalomaniac alcoholic with suicidal tendencies, a flair for politics and a penchant for writing. This book does not portray him in a brilliant light. If anything, it makes James Bond less glamorous, especially since it would seem 007 is a very linear combination of Ian and the various WW2 missions that he oversaw. Kind of underwhelming in that sense. He was also notoriously patriotic and slightly kinky, so Bond being somewhat of a closet wife beater is almost a requirement, and everything British being absolutely the best is also a given. The movies moderate this message quite a bit, hence their international success.Ian Fleming was also distanced from the ordinary soldiers - he did want to be part of the commando, but not quite involved in gory details. He still is one mad bloke, and his contribution to the war effort cannot be denied, but there are some rather gray areas to his actions and personality, and this book explores them well. I like the non-obvious approach to storytelling.This is also one of the flaws of this book - sometimes, it feels like too many conflicting sources were used to compile some of the bits and pieces. The author also has a plummy approach to writing - he never omits to mention who's who - Churchill's uncle, this and that's nephew, rotary club, sir this, lady that, very high society, very posh, with frequent quotes from fiction books, so this sometimes feels almost like a medieval bard paying homage to his patrons. Very English country club with some Jamaican rum in that 5 o'clock tea (it's 5 o'clock somewhere in the empire).It's one of the more unusual history book, for sure, and I liked it quite a bit. It could be a little more polished and cohesive, and the message around Fleming is ambiguous. Which is nice, but then, I wonder if that's not just the result of him not really being able to decide who he wants to be. For that reason, James Bond is also a troubled, unhappy character.Through that lense, it is obvious that Timothy Dalton pulled the best personification of the secret agent. In fact, T Dal is THE BEST Bond evar. There. It had to be said.Recommended, just make sure your brain has an extra cog to spin all the plot lines, curiosities and side stories. And be prepared to have your 007 glamor shattered some.Igor",
            "There are the makings of several good history books in the Nicholas Rankin' s Ian Fleming's Commandos. And for all the meticulous research none of those possible history books are completed.We do eventually get some information about the World War II history of 30 Assault Unit, a.k.a 30 Commando. We do get occasional sightings of Reserve Navy Commander Ian Fleming but up until the end of the book there are very few complete and completely connected narratives.We get something of the usual story of Bletchley Park and decoding the German Enigma machine. There is a little of Alan Turing. This is nice except neither Fleming nor his commandos were read into the secrets of Alan Turing and his code breaking. This is according to the footnotes in the book. There are bits about commando training the formation of what would become the Special Boat Service and a few asides about America's OSS and its Chief Wild Bill Donovan. But at least in these cases there is some evidence that these people had occasional contact with 30 Commando or Fleming.To his credit Rankin mentions several specific achievements by German Intelligence, code breaking and tactical targeted intelligence gathering. This is one of the few books I have read that speaks to these kinds of successes. The text will make the point that Fleming got the idea to form small group commando units for the purpose of targeting and seizing, called pinching, important enemy documents and devices from active battlefields. The more technical term for this approach is given in the preface as TARget EXploitation, TAREX. The term will not be used again.The units within 30 Commando would eventually consist of a few technically trained individuals supported by commando trained Royal Marines. Their job was to go if possible, in front of attacking forces in an effort to overrun radar stations and command bunkers with the intention of collecting papers, codes and secret equipment before they are destroyed in the course of the fighting, as defensive measures by the retreating Germans or the usual souvenir hunting and casual destruction by the indifferent attacking allies.In general I like Rankin's writing style and there are several good individual stories within the larger text. The problem is there's just too many scattered, short, and poorly connected bits of history cobbled together to make his book. Better editing and a tighter focus and Ian Fleming's Commandos would be another good book about a relatively obscure operation within World War II",
            "When you are fighting a strong and well organized enemy- in both military and espionage battles- the fresher your intelligence is, the better off you are. If you can grab information from your enemy without them even knowing- even better. This was the brilliant insight that led the British Intelligence Services and Military Commands to create No 30 Commando, a special unit for Smash and Grab operations- grabbing Axis technology and especially codes at the very frontlines of the action. The unit was husbanded along by none other than Ian Fleming, the future writer of the Fantasy Espionage series of books and movies about the character James Bond. Nicholas Rankin, the author, tells us the story in a fun and compelling way- along the way showing us the fictional events and characters taken directly fom this war service and dropped into the Bond Books.Once created- out of the Commando and Intelligence traditions already extant in the British hierarchy, the unit was thrown into the action right away. Early on in the slow moving Tunisian, Sicilian and Italian Campaigns, the action takes a little while to get going- but when the Normandy Breakout happens- events truly begin to fly. These blokes formed little Jeep columns, attached themselves to Allied Divisional commands- and raced all over Europe grabbing technology and information. As the war wound down- their pace picked UP- as now they had to grab things before the Soviets could. It's a fun ripping yarn, fairly well told.There is some gore- and a lot of adult concepts, office political, and carnal, that makes this book best for junior readers over 11 or 12. For the Gamer/Modeller/Military Enthusiast- a Really cool book. I think it will spawn interesting scenarios for gamers (grab the radar before the germans can blow it up-style)- and great Dioramas too. The Military enthusiast will like this book as a complement to the many others on Ultra and Code-breaking, showing how intel was USED- and Snatch jobs for enemy technology sped up interpretation back at HQ. There are also plenty of gun battles and deft maneuvers and tricks to add to games for effect. At first I got annoyed with the constant mentions of how this material showed up in the Bond books- but by the end I was interested in how Fleming used the books to express himself about that time in his life. A solid rec.",
            "Ian Fleming born into a rich and well connected Scottish banking family was recruited in 1939 into the Royal Navy intelligence division as a personal assistant to NID\u2019s head, Admiral John Godfrey. Fleming had the rank of Commander. He played a key role in the secret world of spies during World War II. He suggested schemes and ideas some of which were taken up and proved notable covert success.I was surprised to learn a fact about Winston Churchill I had not come across or if I did the fact did not stay with me. Rankin stated that after the disaster at Dunkirk Churchill suggested creating commando units. The commando units were created by all the services and are still a key part of the military forces today. Rankin states that the most remarkable and lasting ideas by Fleming was his suggestion that a special group of Royal Marine Commandos be set up. This small group of intelligence gathering raiders who would attack and plunder targeted German establishments---radar stations, Kriegsmarine offices, naval installation, stealing anything useful such as code books, movement orders and so on. It was called 30 Assault Unit. The Unit proved invaluable in North Africa, Sicily, Italy, Rhodes, Yugoslavia and the invasion of France. It was most effective in Germany during the last days of the Third Reich. It stole the entire archives of the German Navy over 500 tons of material.Rankin tells the stories of the unit\u2019s raids, describing the men and their exploits. After the war Fleming wrote the James Bond novels. Rankin tells a bit about Fleming\u2019s personal life and problems after the war to his death. The 30 Assault Unit of the Royal Marines is still in existence and fought in Iraq and Afghanistan.  The book could have benefited from the services of a good editor. I read this as an audio book downloaded from Audible. Napoleon Ryan with his base voice narrated the book. I would have given this book a four for the content but the book needs an editor therefore I could only give it a three.",
            "Quite a fascinating read. I started reading books on WWII aged 12 and have continued reading them. Of course, now there are no auto-biographies coming out and few biographies or studies about the period, so I was pleased to see this one, and even more pleased that it was in the bargain book bin at the Warehouse (my wife was buying clothes, so I wandered off bored).The title could be misleading if you thought that Ian Fleming was the action man James Bond was, but Fleming was a desk warrior and ideas man. The material is very well researched and the bibliography is extensive for those who want to follow up on the contents. Rankin did manage to interview some of the survivors of 30 Assault Unit and weave their thoughts into the text. The Unit's job was to pinch German and Italian technology and secret papers, often working ahead of the army in enemy territory and that was often a very risky job and needed men with nerves of steel. There is an interesting under story where the author gives examples where deeds and characters in the James Bond novels are based on fact (and a lot more so that one would think). Of course, the Bond films are no where near as credible as the novels, even those based on novels.I was interested in the amount of blue on blue incidents related and the number of blunders and lost opportunities, many caused by bureaucracy and/or lack of communication.The Brits are not shiny white, but the American forces are the subject of much criticism, especially by those who were there with their cowboy behaviour or tendency to not be willing to get close to the action.Again, an fascinating read.",
            "If you want to learn more about World War 2 and you are a James Bond fan, this is the book for you.This fact filled work gives a good insight into the use of Commandos for gathering much needed intelligence from the Germans. It illustrates how far behind the Brits really were. While the Germans built new and cutting edges technologies, communications and deadly weapons, the Allies were sacrificing lives at Dunkirk and Dieppe. The book reinforces the debt owed to all those who fought to free Europe and other countries from the Grip of the Axis powers.",
            "Very well researched and easy to read (well structured). I didn't realise that Ian Fleming was so central in the creation and further development of the special No. 30 Commando unit which undertook covert infiltrations into enemy territory by land, sea or air, to capture much needed intelligence, in the form of codes, documents, equipment or personnel. (as Wikipedia describes it). Exciting read definitely, better reading than the James Bond books on fictional agents."

            "Barbara Strong caught the bridal bouquet while everyone watched. Including the sheriff. Since she had moved to Dry Creek with her children it seemed that people did not trust her or accept her in their midst. Actually Sheriff Wall had asked the citizens of Dry Creek to let her get settled in her home before asking her for favors, to be on committees or do odd jobs for social functions. He also asked the ranch hands not to date her for a year. In the meantime, he had her under surveillance. Barbara's ex-husband was in prison for his part in a robbery. But the money had never been recovered and the FBI hoped Barbara would lead them to it or at least one of the other robbers. What they did not know or believe was that she was trying to forget Neal and make a new life for herself, Amanda and Bobby. Life for Barbara took on new excitement and purpose when she agreed to help Sheriff Wall with his reelection campaign. He really did not feel the need of a campaign but liked the idea of meeting with Barbara and becoming better acquainted with her. Soon Linda at the cafe in town and Mrs. Hargrove were helping Carl in his efforts to date Barbara, even though she said they were meetings, not dates. She was not interested in dating or marriage again. She just wanted to be a good mother for Amanda and Bobby. Someday, too, she hoped the people of Dry Creek would include her in their events-maybe even ask her to pour coffee at a social. The sheriff and ranch hands in the area found that she was a caring and enjoyable addition to their townMs. Beth, 2008"

            "This was another cute installment in this series. I read the last one, and this story features some of the same characters. The two children are back but this time it's their mother who is the focus of the story. Barbara just got out of an abusive relationship and she is finally getting to a point where she and her kids are in a good place and a few wrenches are throw in. One of those wrenches is the Sheriff of the town Carl Wall. Enjoyable and cute. A quick read. Quote: 'Folks around here just know me as the sheriff.'Barbara smiled. 'But what if you weren't the sheriff, then?'The sheriff looked at her as though she'd suggested the unthinkable. 'I've been the sheriff here for fifteen years-ever since I was twenty-one'(p. 393). ",

            "This is a sweet, light weight romance. However, the author needs to check some of her earlier books. She adds details that conflict with books 1, 2 and 3. The discrepancies in several characters were both confusing and somehow annoying. For example, Mrs. Hargrove has had three different first names in these books. Then, in this book, it says she moved to dry Creek after she was married. However, into previous books, it says that she lived in Drycreek before her marriage and during her cording. What gives? Still, it's a sweet romance if you can overlook the details."

            "Written in 1933, this book did not age well. At first, Blinky Bill seems to be about a koala family living in the bush of Australia. However the moment you turn the page to chapter two, all the cute innocence of it being a kids book fades away. Mr. Koala is shot three times before dying curled up with his wife and son. It took Mrs. Koala a few days to understand why her husband wasn\u2019t moving, then just left him dead in a tree while her and Blinky Bill move. I\u2019m 22 and I sobbed. It was so descriptive for no good reason. I would never let a child read this. Later on the book there is a group of frogs that fat-shame a larger frog, literally calling him \u201cfatty\u201d and then Blinky Bill accidentally commits murder and just pushes the little frog body into the lake and leaves. Also Blinky\u2019s character changes from a cute little joey to a complete asshole. It\u2019s mischievous and funny, but horrible behavior to display to children.I\u2019d give it one star for a kids book, but I have to give it two stars. Solely because Blinky Bill is a National icon in Australia and perhaps there is something I\u2019m missing here. It\u2019s not like a lost in translation kinda issue, but perhaps it\u2019s a lost in culture and lost in time kinda issue.",
            "Perhaps if I had read this as a child and had the glow of nostalgia upon me, I would have liked this better, but reading it as an adult, I find it rather pedestrian. While there are some nice touches--e.g. Wall is occasionally concerned with providing what I guess you might call conservationally-oriented messages about human predation on Koalas and other creatures, and I am always happy to see a children's book that confronts death as frankly as this one does (Blinky's dad is killed by hunters early on, soldier ants ambush and skeletonize a couple of predators, etc.)--Wall's writing is competent but no more, the plotting, especially in the third of the three books collected here rather loose--especially in the third book, and there's not much in the way of characterization, beyond Blinky Bill being repeatedly and irritatingly very naughty, as the plot requires. The third volume, especially, feels like it was an afterthought. The sequence in which Mrs Koala decides to start running a guest house is especially unimpressive, despite a few nice jokes (e.g. Mrs Koala not knowing what a double bed is). Wall's art is also perfectly fine, but not exceptional. Inessential.",
            "Remember reading these as a child! Loved them very much",
            "In my opinion, the author of 1001 Children's Books You Must Read Before You Grow Up put this book into the wrong section. In my opinion, it should be in the 5+ section, not in the 3+ section. The book is much too long and too wordy for most pre-school children, unless only a few pages (not even a whole chapter) are read at a time (though it might be good for putting a child to sleep). I read the first 5 chapters of the book, which were the first stories about the naughty little koala. I did not like the stories enough to continue on with the other two stories in the book (Blinky Bill Grows Up and Blinky Bill and Nutsy), each of which also have several chapters. It would work as a transitional chapter book for youngsters growing out of beginning readers. As noted, the stories are very wordy, much more wordy than most pre-school picture books of today, but they are illustrated, sometimes an illustration covers an entire page, but most are small illustrations, scattered here and there around the text. The illustrations do capture Blinky Bill's mischievous personality perfectly. "

            "Written in 2001, following the 1999 de facto end of the author\u2019s Pennyfoot Hotel series, this book starts the Manor House series.This first book capably answers the five major questions for a mystery series:(1) WHO the series will be about \u2013 Lady Elizabeth, Major Earl Monroe, USAAF, Violet, Lady Elizabeth\u2019s housekeeper, and Martin, Lady Elizabeth\u2019s senile butler, (2) WHAT the series will be about \u2013 Lady Elizabeth\u2019s inherited role, following her parents\u2019 deaths, in the mental, emotional and physical survival of her manor\u2019s tenants and the neighboring village during an era of drastic change, (3) WHEN \u2013 during WWII, (4) WHERE \u2013 Sitting Marsh, a coastal village in Great Britain, and (5) WHY Lady Elizabeth becomes involved in the murders \u2013 to help heal the emotional wounds of her tenants and the villagers during a time of war.The author\u2019s style is one that flows page-by-page and chapter-to-chapter. The book is a quick but involved read. Paying attention is a must or the clues to the murderer\u2019s identity will just slip right by.This book has a more comfortable feel to it than does the Pennyfoot series. However, the time line begins at least 30 years after the end of the previous series and takes place during the 1940\u2019s, a time more of us will be familiar with. I do not know the age of the author, but, perhaps, she has/had relatives who lived through that era and were able to impart first-hand knowledge to her. I know that my own father was USAAF stationed in Britain during WWII and much of what I read felt familiar, based on his stories of that time.I look forward to the next book in this series \u2013 what mystery will need to be solved, what events of war will affect the Manor and how will Lady Elizabeth help the villagers, and herself, emotionally through the situation.",
            "Fun! Fast and breezy with endearing characters. I particularly like the old butler, Martin. I also like how Lady Elizabeth isn't a naive, twenty-something. The only off-putting thing was the constant use of the word Yanks, but I wonder if that wasn't an authentic depiction of British sentiment at the time. I'm glad I bought the entire series and can't wait to jump into the next book. Thank you, Selah, for the recommendation!",
            "Cute cosy series set in England during World War II one of my favorite settings. Plot, characters are average - easy to read...escape.",
            "Overall, an enjoyable period cozy. There were a few attitudes and ideas held by characters that irked me, although they are accurate to the time period. Martin and Violet were great!"

Sarah Iles Johnston does a very good job at contributing to this field however, and I found it rather enlightening, especially because Hekate in general is not treated very well by academia for the most part, and you can tell that this text, along with her Iles' work in The Restless Dead is looking to remedy that.

            "This slim volume is an edited version of Sarah Iles Johnston's doctoral dissertation on the role of Hekate in the Chaldean Oracles. It is thoroughly researched and well-presented discussion on how a Greco-Roman goddess came to occupy a crucial position in this metaphysical system. Johnston does an excellent job of explaining the ideas of Middle Platonism and the Chaldean Oracles as well as the scholarly issues with their study and interpretation. Non-scholarly readers should still be at least somewhat familiar with Platonic metaphysics and religion of later antiquity as this covers beliefs that will be unknown to the general public's perception of Hekate and Greco-Roman religion. Overall, it is an intriguing read, though repetitive at times, that describes a fascinating instance of how religious and philosophical ideas combine and change over time.",
            "Exceedingly well researched and supported. It is not a light read.",
            "Upon re-reading this book recently, and being much deeper in the literature now, I find that it's not quite as good as I'd remembered it. It's a valuable contribution to a troubled field--the study of the Chaldean Oracles--but it really shows just how badly we are in need of a careful, systematic study of the Oracles. Majercik's edition of the fragments, The Chaldean Oracles: Text Translation and Commentary, is very good (one wishes, of course, that it was more easily available), but can do little to synthesize the material, while Lewy's Chaldaean Oracles and Theurgy: Mysticism Magic and Platonism in the Later Roman Empire, the preeminent attempt at synthesis in English, is way off base much of the time. One is better off with G.R.S. Mead's Chaldaean Oracles, which, though outdated to be sure, at least has the benefit of Mead's superior understanding of the fundamental goals of such literature. Johnston does her best, but taken as a study of the Oracles, this can only be considered a preliminary foray into the material, taken, rather, as a study of Hekate, it fares somewhat better, insofar as Johnston steers clear of the erroneous generalizations endemic in authors who treat of this Goddess in passing or, worse, use these generalizations as the grounds for further erroneous inferences, e.g., about the Oracles. All in all, then, a book from which one need not be warned away, but which is best approached with limited expectations, and with a healthy caution with respect to some of the inferences Johnston regards as self-evident, particularly when her principal justification for them is the unanimity of the previous literature on the Oracles, the shortcomings of which she is well aware of. ",
            "This was so interesting, but it opened up more questions in my mind about Hekate than it solved. It's a shame so much information has been lost in history!",
            "It was interesting to review arguments in favor of Hecate's intermediary role and representation of the Soul in Chaldean Oracles. It was also intriguing to review the early representations of sympathetic magic and the correlation between theurgy and philosophy of the early Greco-Roman literary period. She focuses mostly on Iamblichus, Proclus, Psellus and a few others in this book. I would say that her style is a bit frustrating. The argument is redundant and a good editor could have reduced this thesis by about 50 pages. Additionally, I would have liked to have seen more of the original texts in the Appendices (rather than just those she selected for review...and repeated). "

Despite their numerical disadvantage, General Joseph E. Johnston's Confederate forces successfully ambushed one wing of Sherman's army on March 19, 1865 but were soon repulsed. For the Confederates, it was a heroic but futile effort to delay the inevitable: within a month, both Richmond and Raleigh had fallen, and Lee had surrendered. Nathaniel Hughes offers a full-length tactical study of the battle of Bentonville, the only major Civil War battle fought in North Carolina and the Confederacy's last attempt to stop the devastating march of Sherman's army north through the Carolinas. In careful detail, Hughes lays out Confederate and Union troop movements and places the engagement within the larger military framework of the last months of the war. Analyzing the reasons for the initial success and eventual failure of General Joseph E. Johnston's offensive, Hughes maintains that Sherman showed great restraint by remaining committed to the larger goal of reaching Goldsboro rather than stopping to pursue or destroy the defeated Confederates.",

            "Bentonville was a battle which should not have been fought. This is the conclusion reached by Nathaniel Cheairs Hughes Jr., and it is difficult to argue against that conclusion. Hughes narrates the events in such a way that the reader is not cheering for either side in the battle, at least I wasn't. I was left with a feeling of sadness that anyone - Union of Confederate - had to die in such a massive battle only a month before the war ended. The pitiful condition of the Confederate Army of Tennessee is skillfully described throughout the book, and I particularly admire the courage of those soldiers who continued to fight for their country, even after their once-proud army of 60,000 had been reduced to 4,500 troops. Sherman is not much of a presence in the book, despite his portrait featured on the cover. Certainly he performed his duty as an army group commander, but it was a battle that he did not expect and did not want. Sherman wanted to spare his own army any additional suffering, and he, along with Johnston, seemed to know that the end of the war was near. The chapters rapidly advance through the events and alternate in their perspective - Union, Confederate, and Union again, bringing a good balance to the narrative. The author also has a talent for describing the terrain, which is especially helpful considering the few maps contained in the book. The Battle of Bentonville is generally overlooked, and Hughes brings long-overdue attention to this last major battle of the Civil War's Western armies. If you are interested in Sherman's campaigns through the Carolinas, this book is a must-read. ",
            "This is a very enjoyable book to read and offers a detailed and well researched account of the final battle between Sherman and Johnston at Bentonville fought on March 19-21, 1865. This was the last full scale battle between the two opposing armies. The book has 9 maps which are well presented and the battle ones are very easy to understand and follow. Overall this book is a well documentated account of this very interesting and bloody battle.",
            "This is an enjoyable book about Joe Johnston's last offensive gasp at in the Carolinas, and of his army as a whole. Johnston chose a strategic location which afforded him the opportunity to strike one of Sherman's two wings while they were separated. The Confederate force by this point was a mixed conglomeration of troops that had survived the carnage at Franklin and Nashville, veterans that had followed Sherman through the Atlanta campaign and the march to the sea, as well as green raw troops. Small units abounded, yet there were a number of senior generals leading to an interesting leadership dynamic. Sherman's power was inevitably too much for Johnston's army to handle, but the book provides solid detail of the tactics involved on both sides of the lines, as well as the impact of the leadership decisions. My biggest issue with the book is that I did not find the transitions between some chapters to be very clean. One chapter may primarily describe the Federal point of view while the next chapter is the Confederate point of view, but the reference to time is not made clear leaving it uncertain where the narrative is picking back up.",
            "Very good tactical study of the battle. There are not enough maps to support the detailed narrative which is why I only gave it 4 stars. Still it\u2019s an excellent study of an obscure battle. ",
            "Joseph Johnston is not generally thought of as an aggressive general in battle. This book does a nice job of showing that he could be aggressive, as he initiated a risky, long-shot battle at Bentonville, North Carolina as the Civil War was nearing its close.This is a well written description of that battle, showing how the battle itself was designed by Johnston, how it was actually fought, who the better and poorer commanders were.For those interested in a detailed depiction of the battle, this is a nice resource.",
            "Excellent book about one of the last battles of the Civil War, with plenty of maps and first person narratives to understand what the battle was like for the soldiers fighting it. The only downside to the book is the format used by the author, a couple chapters would cover a segment of the battle from the Union side only, then the next chapter or two would cover the same period of time from the Confederate side only.",

            "Why do I keep my cookbooks? I don\u2019t use them. Not only are there more recipes on the internet than I could ever find in a cookbook, I never really used my cookbooks even before the internet. But whenever I think about going Marie Kondo on my bookshelves, I give my cookbooks a free pass. And I think I know why. These books tell a story about me. They tell the story of me and food. I became a vegetarian in the late 80s. It was shortly after I got my own apartment and started cooking for myself full-time. One day I was at Hunter College and I saw some anti-vivisection posters and pamphlets. This led me to read Animal Liberation by Peter Singer. I learned about factory farming from Singer\u2019s book. But it wasn\u2019t any argument that persuaded me to become a vegetarian. It was those photos of animal suffering that did it. Since I was new to cooking there was no difficulty in immediately adopting my new diet. I had been a finicky eater since childhood and had no particular fondness for meat. Add to that my squeamishness around raw meat and it seemed like vegetarianism was the perfect diet for me. This was all before the spate of meat-substitutes we see in supermarket freezers today. This was a time when tofu and tempeh were considered meat-substitutes. In other words, it was a good time to be a vegetarian. I learned to eat fruit, vegetables, nuts, grains, and seeds. I drank soy milk and subscribed to Vegetarian Times magazine. Naturally I bought a few cookbooks and received others as gifts. They were all fun to flip through, but the recipes were usually too complicated for me. I had no real interest in cooking and my tastes were simple. Why would I want to hunt down ten exotic ingredients to make a gourmet dinner out of the Moosewood Cookbook, when I could just make a pot of brown rice and steam some veggies? Beans were a staple in vegetarian cooking, so The Brilliant Bean also made it into my library. Although not a vegetarian cookbook, most of the recipes could be made without meat. I considered it one of my essential cookbooks even though I never once made a recipe from it. Its main value to me was the information about soaking and cooking a variety of beans. It did give me some ideas and inspirations, but the recipes were complicated and would not have pleased me any more than good old rice and beans.Another of my never-used but essential cookbooks was The Tofu Book. The cover had the same design as the Nasoya tofu packaging. Not surprising since it was co-written by one of the founders of Nasoya Foods. I love that it has instructions for making soy milk and tofu. Were I to have followed those instructions, I wouldn\u2019t have needed to buy Nasoya tofu anymore. But Nasoya Foods had nothing to worry about. True to form, not only did I not make my own tofu, I also ignored the recipes and just threw cubed tofu into my pan of saut\u00e9ed veggies. The most useful of my cookbooks was Fresh Produce. Created by the editors of Sunset Books and Sunset Magazine, it was actually more of a reference book on fruit and vegetables than a cookbook. But it was just what I needed. For each fruit or vegetable, there are color photos and basic methods of storage and preparation. The information is simple and straightforward. And finally there is my favorite cookbook, Vegetariana. I can\u2019t say I made any of the recipes in this one either, but it\u2019s full of historical anecdotes, quotations from classic literature, and whimsical illustrations. How many other cookbooks have names like Lewis Carroll, Nathaniel Hawthorne, and Percy Bysshe Shelley in their bibliographies? As I thumb through these old yellowed books, most of which I haven\u2019t opened in twenty years, I realize something: My cookbook library doesn\u2019t just tell a story about my relationship with food. It also tells a story about my relationship with my vegetarianism. In the 80s, my diet was often regarded as unusual. I frequently fielded the incredulous question \u2013 \u201cWhat do you eat?\u201d \u2013 posed by people who imagined a dinner plate with a baked potato, a piece of broccoli, and a big empty space where the meat ought to be. While I\u2019m grateful to see tofu and soy milk and many other vegetarian options in even the most mainstream supermarkets, I am not pleased at all with the highly-processed mock meats. I started out as an ethical vegetarian, but over the years I have evolved into a health-conscious vegetarian as well. So my cookbooks stay on my shelves. As I reminisce about my vegetarian journey, I come to suspect that these books influenced me more than I thought. My cooking may be simple, but it satisfies me. If I am in need of inspiration, these books will keep me grounded to my old-school vegetarian roots.",

As Ave Maria reaches into the past to find answers to the present, readers will stay with her every step of the way, rooting for the onetime town spinster who embraced love and made a family. ,Milk Glass Moon, ,is about the power of love and its abiding truth, and captures Trigiani at her most lyrical and heartfelt.,From the Hardcover edition.",

            "The third book in the Big Stone Gap series. While I really enjoyed the first two books in this series, Big Stone Gap and Big Cherry Holler, I found this one to be just okay, a little better than average.The main character of this book is Ave Maria Mulligan MacChesney. In the first two books I really loved her character and her choices in life. This time I wanted to shake her more than once. Instead of the strong character from the first two books she seemed whiney and even shrewish at times, especially within her relationship to her teenaged daughter. I also felt he book seemed rushed, going through years with the turn of a page.That said I still enjoy the eccentric characters, and the beautiful descriptions, especially of Italy. And I love Jack Mac, Ave's true blue husband, even though I think his appearances here were mostly to calm down Ave after one of her outbursts.Not as good as the first two, but still gets extra points for bringing me on another trip to Big Stone Gap, which probably won't happen again, as it appears as if there is another book in the series it will be centered elsewhere.",
            "Really enjoyed this novel, the 3rd in the Big Stone Gap series by Adriana Trigiani. Although I had enjoyed the first book in the series titled Big Stone Gap, I did not enjoy the 2nd book in the series as much. However, this novel was back at the same enjoyment level for me as the 1st book. I love the characters, Fleeta, the stereotypical redneck Southern woman, Iva Lou, the woman who loved men but had finally found true love with her husband, Lyle, Etta MacChesney, headstrong daughter of Ave Maria Mulligan MacChesney, Jack MacChesney, a good man who stays true to Ave Maria through all their difficulties, and, of course, Ave Maria Mulligan MacChesney, the main character of the book. In this book, the reader watches Ave Maria, Jac and Etta go through the challenges of raising a daughter through her teenage years. Once again, Ave Maria and Etta return to Italy this time accompanied by husband Jack, where they spend time with Ave Maria's family and Etta renews her relationship with a young Italian man she had met their first trip to Italy. As always, Trigiani has done an outstanding job in portraying the language and lifestyle of a small town in the Appalachian mountains.",
            "This was pretty much 3 stars....but I appreciated the ending so I am rounding up. I haven't read the other books in this series so I have nothing to compare it to.I did the audio on this and the author did her own narration. I am not a fan of this at all. The author in this case wasn't completely awful, but she clearly can NOT do voices. It was hard sometimes to follow along on who was talking. She did try to place a noticeable pause between the different people when doing dialog, so that helped. But this could have been so much better if a professional had done this.This was about a family, their extended family and their small community. They were following the rhythm of life dealing with the ups and downs. I liked that it covered a lot of different things. I guess I appreciated the 'down to earth' sense this carried. I think this is always a good reminder for me when I get too caught up in problems...because it usually is small stuff not worth the lather.",
            "As always, Trigiani did not disappoint. As much as I disliked Jack Mac in Big Cherry Holler, I grew to love him that much more in Milk Glass Moon. Finally Ave Maria lightened up a little and I didn't find myself being angry with her reactions to the ever present life challenges. I laughed, I cried, I couldn't put it down. It seems that all too often with book series, the author runs out of ideas or just can't quite live up to the first book, Trigiani and the Big Stone Gap series is not in that category. So far I think Milk Glass Moon might be my favorite of the series, but each book has been just as good as the first. I cannot wait to start the final book, but at the same time, I do not want to leave all the characters and Big Stone Gap behind. ",
            "Sometimes, books just don't need a sequel. Hunger Games clearly needed sequels. The Fellowship of the Ring clearly needed sequels. But Big Stone Gap? No. There was absolutely NO need for follow-up. Ave Maria is horrible in this book. She makes her daughter's marriage about her, not Etta. She tries to control Etta, which never works, and she's so unsupportive of Jack that it astonished me how he put up with it. There were no shocking twists or turns, no big moments that needed resolve, and certainly no cliffhangers. I just have a really hard time reading about the first-world, manufactured issues that Ave Maria has, most of which she creates herself. ",
            "3rd in the series, this book\u2019s main focus is on the evolving relationship between Ave Maria &amp, her daughter Etta. Etta is maturing into a headstrong young woman and making life choices that don\u2019t fit with Ave\u2019s idea of how she should live her life. This struggle of wills is handled with insight &amp, intelligence. The novel jumps around between small town Virginia, the Italian countryside &amp, New York, keeps it interesting. All the great supporting characters are back, at this point they seem like old friends "

            "On the cover of this book is a pair of gloved hands wringing out a sponge. This book was about as appealing as that dirty sponge water.The message of the book is fine - Clean living in a contaminated world. I'd agree that as Christians, this is something we should be examples of. The problem is that the message of the book stops at Clean living and doesn't challenge you to anything further, as if clean living is going to make your life with Christ what you always wanted it to be. It will not.The concepts and principles in this book are so elementary it's painful - I would not even recommend this book to a new Christian. The message of the cross is so much deeper, so much more costly, so much more controversial and so much more difficult than the message of clean living. In fact, striving for it seems almost backwards - If you're truly committed to following Christ and getting your hands dirty for the gospel, clean living is only going to result from that - you're not going to have to seek it out. The Holy Spirit is already convicting you on every topic in this book if you only listen.He even uses the poop in the brownies illustration. You know the one.In addition, I was not at all a fan of his writing style. I felt like I was reading a high school essay. I'd say 70% of this book is uninteresting anecdotes from the author's life, 15% is the author asking hypothetical questions that the reader can't answer, 10% is poor illustrations of different sins as toxins or poisons, and 5% is quoted or paraphrased scripture.I realize I'm being entirely brutal, but I forced myself to painfully plod my way all the way to the end of this thing. Go read something by Tozer or Lewis or Bonhoeffer or Claiborne or Plantinga or Platt or any number of other fine Christian authors. Let Craig Groeschel continue to make his cool smartphone Bible apps and leave the writing to folks that can write."

        "positive_reviews": [
            "This is a difficult book to review. It could be a life-changing book for some readers, but it could be harmful to others. Some people need this book, some people should never read it.The author has been rated as one of the top 10 influential pastors in the US. He writes well, is honest and real, and is Scripturally accurate.But this is not a religious book or even a Bible study.As a University student, I had no religious beliefs and was not even sure if God existed. I read widely and had an open mind, just wanting to learn the truth about everything. I took a Psychology course where one topic was taught in each 90-minute class. One long lecture was on forgiveness. I remember thinking that I had wasted 90 minutes of my life because the Bible which I had just started to read said the same thing in one sentence. Once I discovered that the Bible was accurate and concise in this one area, I began reading it for any other truth that I could find, deciding that I would receive anything that was truth and discard the rest. I thought that a lot of the Bible was mythology. After many years, I discovered that the Bible was true in everything as long as it was translated correctly.This book talks about toxic behaviors, toxic emotions and toxic influences. The author gives many examples from real life. He also includes Scriptures but does not use them in a preachy way. He includes them almost as if he is quoting someone whom you know or respect like Einstein or Ghandi. So it is a very comfortable non-threatening book for someone who has had previous bad experiences with religion.I was not going to finish reading this book because it is written at a simple enough level that I thought it could not include something that I did not already know. But I am glad that I finished it. Craig Groeschel is thorough. For example, I know that bitterness is dangerous and is a root that cannot be allowed in my life because it hurts me. But I think I ignored the end of the verse in Heb. 12:14-15 (see that no bitter root grows up to cause trouble and hurt many -- my paraphrase). I never realized how bitterness would hurt others besides me. I would stop bitterness when I felt it, so I did not experience how it poisoned the atmosphere, relationships and the lives of others. This book is worth reading because of its thoroughness and insight.It is simple and could easily be read using it as a study around the dinner table because its examples are easily understood even by young children.But where this book falls short in my opinion is how it deals with people's toxic thoughts, behaviors and relationships.As anyone who has struggled with a problem knows, it is sometimes not enough just to use will power or to be accountable to friends to stop these behaviors. To tell someone who is struggling with self-cutting or pornography or other serious issues described in the book just to stop with the help of friends is setting everyone up for failure and frustration. More than that, it is setting people up to feel like a failure, give up and think that even God can't help. Serious problems need more than will power, they need spiritual power.Where this book falls short, in my opinion, is that the author tries so hard to not be religious that he tells people to ask God for help in some of these things without giving specific instructions on how to get the power of God inside them.I know what it was like before I was born again to ask God for help in something. And I know what it was like after I had the power of God inside me. The first was difficult, the second was much easier. And after I was filled with the Holy Spirit, victories came much more easily often in minutes instead of months.At the end of the book, he says that we need to acknowledge that we cannot keep the laws, we need a Savior, and we can get this only by faith. But he does not tell us how to do it. He says we need power but not will power. But he does not clearly lead people to a relationship with God. I can see many readers reading this book and feeling frustrated because they do not know how to make this final step.To me, there are 3 levels of relationship with God: when God is on the outside, when He is on the inside, and when the person is filled with the Holy Spirit. Even the early church did not understand this, and disciples would ask new believers if they had received the Holy Spirit since the time that they were born again.This is not being preachy. It is simply the difference between paddling a canoe across a lake, using a small outboard motor, or using twin 250 HP inboards. If you make the power available, the job is easier. Being filled with the Holy Spirit gives a person much easier victory over difficult addictions like pornography.This is the reason that I was unsure how to rate this book. It is a good beginning, but it is like teaching a person everything about driving a car except where the ignition and accelerator are... this book can be valuable in the hands of someone who knows how to lead the reader to being born again and filled with the Holy Spirit.But if you read this book and try to make the changes on your own power, you will probably fail and end up feeling condemned.Becoming born again is an easy step, and one that should not have been omitted from this book. I feel that this book is very weak in this very important step. He says Power, not Will Power but he does not show very clearly how to get this power. Even a simple evangelistic magazine will include a few steps in a sidebar or a page at the end praying with the person. This is not a message that should be read between the lines. It should be clear and concise.It is like giving a person a list of ingredients but not telling him what to do with them. If you need clear instructions about whether to add dry ingredients to wet or wet to dry or what oven temperature to use, surely you deserve clear instructions about how to get the power of God inside your life. Step by step.",
            "Truly excellent. I would honestly rate this 5 stars, but it only suffers when placed next to the other books I have read this year. Highly recommend!",
            "This book needs to be read once a year by people who are serious about growing in their faith. It\u2019s just that good. ",
            "Soul Detox breaks down the worldly bad habits we have and then shows how it impedes our walk with God and other Christians. Then the author concludes by telling you to pray about your problems. This book has the characteristics of an opener to a classic christian living guide and then it leaves the reader to figure out the rest on your own. The book's ending is a bit deflating. I am not well versed in modern christian writing so the narration rubbed me the wrong way in a couple places. I was expecting profound perspective from a spiritual leader but only found common sense tales and catch phrases from a motivational speaker type. The buildups and funny life lessons seemed very cookie cutter-ed. The writer's tone made the material feel scattered at times and unnaturally forced at others.The book does make some very good points about life practices, bad habits, and tendencies that people take for granted but it could have been so much more. The author seems like he is trying hard and if he would cut down on the buddy-buddy, cool normal guy conversation points and fill in the gaps with more in depth practical application points this would have become the lifestyle challenging book it was meant to be.My one big gripe is the last chapter. We are reading your book to learn something and gain perspective. I find enjoyment in these books because I am challenged to shift my perspective and way of thinking. This isn't the kind of book that someone would just start reading out of the blue. The last chapter left the impression that the author was not very serious about the book. He congratulates the reader for making it through his small book and then accuses them of wasting their time and missing out on great truths if they didn't take the whole book seriously. Call me old fashioned but I don't think that patronizing sarcasm is the best method to get a point across to an audience that feels deeply connected to the subject matter. The statements cast a negative implication on an otherwise heartfelt conclusion to the book. Overall the book wasn't bad and it's content would probably make a good theme for a study group. I would recommend it to someone looking for a perspective on the christian view of the perils of worldly living. ",
            "Craig Groeschel is a preacher for today\u2019s world. He is the founder of a LifeChurch.TV, with fourteen locations and is on the web. Groeschel has podcasts available through the itunes store, and has written several books. Soul Detox is an excellent choice for many of today\u2019s Christians, who have allowed the world to take over their lives instead for living a life pleasing to God. Groeschel does not preach he merely presents well thought out reasoning pointing out how many of us have lost sight of the kind of life that the Lord chooses us to live. What has today become accepted in the world cannot be allowed in the life of a Christian, because it leads us away from God instead of toward Him as we are intended to move. This is was really eye opening to me, forcing me to begin to make some changes in my life where I had become lax. Groeschel\u2019s term \u2018Christian-Atheist\u2019 really struck home. We know the commandments, yet we choose to break them, since often the world says it is OK. This is an excellent choice for anyone. It is such an easy read, that it would make a great gift for young people, or could be studied in a youth study group. Don\u2019t get me wrong, it should be read by most adults, too. This one book will change your life.Galley provided by NetGalley.",
            "this book was okay and definitely presented some basic truths but lacked overall originality. and if you\u2019ve ever read any of this author\u2019s other books, he recycles so many of his personal stories and illustrations that it\u2019s quite noticeable and annoying.",
            "Occasionally, if one ventures to plumb the depths of Christian pop psychology, it is not unfathomable why so many people cultivate a healthy dislike for the reading of books. There are many who read books that were only written in the last decade or so. If you belong to this majority, and, unless you have taught yourself the use of discriminating taste, the odds are that everything you\u2019ve recently read has been poorly written. But, the degradation of quality writing doesn\u2019t stop there. There is poor quality writing and then there is the imitation of poor quality writing. Pastor Craig Groeschel\u2019s Soul Detox: Clean Living in a Contaminated World is of the latter variety. Such second-hand derivations of secular pop psychology currently fills the bestseller lists of the Christian bookseller. If you are unfortunate enough to be reading bestsellers written within the insular American Christian subculture, then the quality of what you read is going to be improbably bad.I read this book out of curiosity. The image on the cover, consisting of two rubber gloves squeezing chemicals out of a sponge, ought to have given me pause. When you begin reading the English prose of Pastor Craig Groeschel, the air positively begins to reek of bleach. His metaphors alluding to germs and toxins and poisons and \u201cpoop\u201d fly around in this book, at first ceaselessly, but that is before his metaphorical exuberance begins to get rather embarrassing. The images of cleanliness in Soul Detox do not give one the impression of health so much as they give one the impression of the cold, white, sterile, antiseptic padded walls and floors of an asylum that Groeschel firmly believes is in sore need of a generous dose of spiritual Pine-Sol.( You can read further here - http://redemptiosehnsucht.blogspot.co... )"

Her love for him shows so clearly, as does the agony of losing the other half of your soul. My heart almost broke progressing through the book. Anyone who appreciates modern American poetry should definitely pick this up, and savour the 90+ pages while it lasts.",

It was to this impregnable fortress that the Germans sent all those prisoners who persisted in escaping from other camps, such as Stalag Luft III (of THE GREAT ESCAPE FAME). Once within the walls of Colditz, the Germans reasoned, escape was impossible. And yet during the four-year period when the castle was used as a prison over 300 men escaped, 31 of whom managed to complete the hazardous journey home through Germany. Prisoners from 10 different countries formed a truly international escape academy. Skeleton keys were made, German passes forged, maps drafted, and all manner of tools and machinery constructed out of whatever the prisoners had to hand. The ingenuity of the escape artists knew no bounds: they tried everything from tunnelling, to hiding in rubbish sacks, disguising themselves as German officers, and leaping acrobatically from the castle walls.",

I bought it for less than a dollar and as I started to re-read it I realized how fortunate I was!There was something thrilling about the tenacity and purpose of prisoner of war officers seeing their duty as trying to escape this formidable German prison during WW2. Not only were they using the power of their brains and working together but they were fighting the enemy by needing more and more resources to keep them incarcerated. There were many phenomenal escapes and even in event of failure a attitude of doubling down and never giving up the attempts.During Covid times this book seemed to speak to my spirit and mind to find new and resourceful ways to escape boredom and complacency, as well as creatively love my family and friends. It made me was to stretch resources and encourage others. The tenacity as well as the humanity of these prisoners of war was relevant today and inspired and awed me!

            "The amazing true story of the men imprisoned in Colditz Castle, surely the most impressive prisoner-of-war camp in modern history.The prisoners sent to Colditz had all escaped before from other camps and were sent there because it was considered escape-proof - ha! The Germans' mistake, of course, was to concentrate all that energy and skill in one place, so the prisoners were not so much concerned with whether they could escape but whether they could beat their fellow prisoners to the draw.British, American, French, Polish, Dutch and Belgian (and probably others - can't remember if there were any Russians) competed for this privilege and their plans had to be agreed and scheduled by the Escape Committee to prevent clashes and people trying to escape at the same time.Making uniforms and trying to walk out the gate, cutting through floors to gain access to empty rooms, tunneling into the drains and even building a glider in an attic - their schemes were myriad and ingenious.The stories, the men's feelings, the upsets, dramas, German searches and the occasional successes, they are all laid out here in glorious detail. You will feel their pain, discomfort, lack of food, as well as their joy over a game of football or their ecstasy after a successful escape.Pity too the poor German officers and guards, who had the unenviable task of managing hundreds of fit young men, all of whom had nothing to do but plan their escape. They had to try to keep them happy whilst maintaining discipline and trying to keep their Nazi overlords contented, a thankless task that saw quite a bit of understanding and appreciation between prisoners and guards.This is an exciting, entertaining read and a first hand historical account of a fascinating and concentrated event in history, hence five stars.This is a shorter version of Pat Reid's book. The full story has recently been published by The Folio Society.If you get a chance, watch the fantastic BBC series made in the seventies from this book. It stars David McCallum, Robert Wagner, Bernard Hepton, Patrick Troughton and Jeremy Kemp, among many others."

            "Many of the mathematical ideas once considered impossible This is one of those books where I dislike the title, yet love the content. Mathematicians generally go where the necessity and reasoning takes them, so it is a misnomer to claim that they have a yearning for the impossible. Also, to argue that mathematical results are impossible at some point then are considered routine later is incorrect.  As mathematical knowledge has expanded, new discoveries sometimes contradict and in all cases extend previous knowledge. What was thought to be impossible earlier is demonstrated to be possible, so the earlier \u201cfact\u201d was simply a \u201csignificant misunderstanding.\u201d Stillwell discusses several of these \u201csignificant misunderstandings\u201d in this book. They are:*) The discovery of irrational numbers.*) The discovery of imaginary (complex) numbers.*) The discovery of perspective and points at infinity. *) The development of calculus and the use of the infinitesimal. *) The discovery of non-Euclidean geometry and curved space.*) The discovery of the quaternions and the fourth dimension.*) The discovery of the algebraic ideal and the loss of unique factorization. When each of these discoveries was made, that discovery changed some aspects of mathematics forever. The previous ideas were not somehow just rendered \u201cinoperable\u201d but were shown to be restricted cases of a more general result. Irrational numbers were found to be the limits of sets of rational numbers, real numbers were found to be a subset of complex numbers and Euclidean geometry was found to be just one possibility among multiple options. Stillwell does an excellent job laying the historical foundations for these discoveries, he is to be commended for his historical accuracy.  While the word impossible certainly is a powerful word to catch your eye, it is inappropriately placed in the title of this book. However, that is really the only complaint that I will lodge about it. The rest is first-rate.  Published in Journal of Recreational Mathematics, reprinted with permission",

            "Daniel Defoe wrote during the very beginnings of the creation of the novel as we know it. His book Robinson Crusoe was a huge hit and was a groundbreaker in fiction in the way it presented the story. This book, Memoirs .... was quite different in that it was essentially like a James Mitchner Historical Book giving vast detail about the period of history included in the book with the intent of instructing the reader as to the subject matter. In this Mr Defoe succeeded quite well, one can begin this book knowing nothing about the 30 years war in Europe nor anything about the English Civil War and end up fairly well informed about both. An aside about the 30 years war, It could reasonably be called World War I since it involved most of the countries of Europe and killed about 8 million people. I recommend Memoirs.... with the caveat that it is dense with detail to the point of being boring at points, just keep thinking James Mitchner Historical Novel and you get the picture. ",
            "The back cover makes it sound like Defoe wanted to write a fake memoir of a military man to show how incapable someone who was in the middle of great events might be at putting them into a coherent picture with some perspective. In practice that means that this novel seems entirely lacking in structure and comes down to a seemingly endless and shapeless parade of bare names and dates without much narrative fleshing out of characters or scenes. And then... and then... and then... I think I know less about the Thirty Years War now than I did a month ago. The first time Defoe has let me down. Better to pick up Moll Flanders again....",

            " My son loves these books. We started reading National Geographic Kids books when he was about six (he's nine now) and I can honestly say that these books have been instrumental in teaching him to read. One weekend, the child actually read a 300 pg. book (one from the Weird, But True Series) to my husband and I over the course of two days - 50 pg.s three times a day until he'd finished. I mention this because last year my son was sent to a reading specialist because his teacher was concerned that he was reading below his age-level. Although I was happy for him to receive the extra attention from the specialist, I always doubted that he had any real problems reading because he read the Nat'l Geo books to us constantly. Thankfully, I was right. He no longer sees the reading specialist, reads above his grade-level, and even reads out-loud to his classmates at lunchtime.Why is this so important? Because kids are often labeled as poor readers when it's not that they can't read, but rather that they simply aren't interested in what they are being given to read. My teen-age step-daughter grew up thinking that she was a poor reader, too. That all changed when I gave her the Twilight Series. She read the last book, Breaking Dawn, (756 pages) in less than 48 hours!There are several elements that make the Nat'l Geo series so appealing, particularly to elementary aged boys. The layouts are very simple, not cluttered. Each joke (or fact in the Weird, But True Series) is only one or two sentences long. The font is much larger than what you would find in a typical chapter book designed for this age group. And the visual images are excellent - exciting, funny, interesting - they immediately draw the reader in, curious to find out more.The Just Joking Series is one of my son's favorites. We'd previously purchased the first book in the series and my husband and I had each spent several evenings with my son taking turns with him reading the jokes aloud and cracking each other up. We purchased the box set (includes books 1-3) in September for his birthday and are almost through the other two books, as well. We've also pre-ordered Just Joking #4.The jokes in these books are mostly very funny, very clean, and only occasionally so dumb that they merit the buzzer sound (think America's Got Talent). The joke books also include several tongue twisters. Truthfully, our son doesn't really care for these, but the jokes more than make up for this.Of all the joke books we've got, these are our favorites. As a parent, teacher, library volunteer, and chairperson of my son's Scholastic Book Fairs, I can definitely recommend both the boxed set and the individuals titles in the series for lower elementary-aged children. ",
            "Another installment of animal-related jokes, riddles, and tongue twisters, this collection features large, colorful upclose photographs of a host of animals including chameleons, swans, roosters, elephants and owls. Some of the animals' poses encourage laughter. There are a few funny photographs of humans included too, and they, too, relate to the jokes being told. Children won't be the only audience for this title, which is filled with really funny pictures and jokes. One of my favorites ones has to do with the use of Spacebook by aliens trying to keep in touch with friends (p. 14). This is definitely a page-turner, and it won't stay on the shelves for very long.

G. Wilfong traces the lives and careers of individual women and, through them, arrives at an understanding of the reality of women's lives in this place and time. ,Contrary to the submissive, demure ideals for women proposed by the religious writers of Christian Egypt, the evidence from Jeme points to a more complex, dynamic situation. Women were active in the home, but some also played important and visible parts in the religious and economic life of their community. A bishop's attempts to monitor the behavior of the women in his district, the intricate inheritance dispute between an aunt and her niece, one woman's pious donations of murals to a church, three women's agonized decisions to give up their children to the local monastery, and the transactions of a family of women moneylenders--all these episodes paint a vivid picture of life in a Coptic town. ,Although the remains of Jeme have long been known to scholars, little synthetic work has been done on this rich source for social history in Egypt before and after the Muslim conquests. ,The Women of Jeme, is the first book-length study of the evidence. It will be of interest to Egyptologists and papyrologists, as well as to scholars of Coptic studies, early Christianity, social history and women's studies.

            "The writing is pretentious and tries too hard to impress - I'm putting that out there from the start. But I also finished it over two evenings of reading, so there was a compelling pull to the underlying story as well. It probably says more about me than the book that I would have preferred a point of view from the 28 year old rather than the 17 year old. It's divided into three sections - essentially 1) the build-up to the romance 2) the romance and 3) the decline of the romance. There were certainly areas of wonderful clarity and familiarity and I enjoyed the tension and awkwardness in the first part a great deal, but on principle I have a problem with narrative structure that's too transparent, in which the anatomy of the finale is known from the beginning. In this book, the reader knows from the first page that the relationship fails, so by the time I get to the third part of the story, there's no suspense, only a depressing denoument that has no twists and very little internal tension. Nothing happens, it just falls apart. If something had happened that forced a reinterpretation of the first page, I might have had a different reaction. At heart though, this novel is a portrait of the rise and fall of a relationship - simple - and that's a premise that both limits and frames the events within. If the quality of the writing and the insights had been better, this might have been exactly the type of lyrical prose I'd fall head over heels for. Just not this time. It didn't quite pull it off for me, and the characters didn't stick in my head either. The book definitely brought to mind the advantages of other genres though - if a relationship fails, it's not the end of the whole story (as it was here) - there's always plenty of other supporting or overriding plot to keep things going.

            "One word: lukewarm. (Contains spoiler)Beautifully written, Pages for You could have been quite a brutally realistic romance crafted with the omniscient fluidity of Brownrigg's writing, sadly, it wasn't for me. Though given a charming narrative with particularly gorgeous scenes, I couldn't shake the fact that I absolutely hated the ending. It wasn't the fact that Anne ended up with the surprisingly perfecto Jasper who we learn 'had a place' in Anne all along that could not be filled by Flannery or the fact that it lacked in spontaneity or was deprived of some sort of climactic voluptuous rendezvous, it was the fact that it had to be a guy. It irked me because I felt it perpetuated the common misconception that women merely lust for one another when a guy isn't around and then resume to some form of male worship when they get back. It annoyed me a lot and although the ending was respectably simplistic it completely ruined it for me. Another thing that I wasn't fond of: Flannery. Generally, I have this idea that there are some protagonists in Lit that are their story and there are others that are used for their story...and I felt Flan fell into the latter category. I didn't like her at all. After I finished the book I concluded merely that a) she was pretty and that b) she was in love with Anne. That was all. I understand that she was trying to 'find herself' but I would've liked her to have just a little bit more of a personality than just some pretty college girl who we know could have any guy she wants yet is (or is not?) a lesbian who seems to care little for anyone else but Anne. Brownrigg's writing is worth one of those 3 stars, nonetheless. Some scenes she transcribes in a kind of 'watercolour fashion' i.e, in a very delicately exquisite way. It's likely I'm just being really picky but I couldn't help noticing faults here and there (and hating myself for it at the same time). It's still quite a nicely told story and I did swoon over certain snippets (hehe). To prove it I'll finish with some of my favourite quotes/parts in the tale: I'd like to pay your palms the same favor that you pay these pages, searching them for grooves and images and the secret signs of hunger, as you may scan these words for hidden messages. The lines of your hand might be a guide to your gifts for pleasure, or a clue to where you'll take me, or a map of where I might take you.But sleeping: that was a new intimacy altogether and one Flannery often could not believe she shared. It was a secret, wasn't it? Sleeping? What a person looked like when they couldn't help it, what that defenselessness might suggest, what revelations might be conveyed by that loosened, floppy shape, in the unintended words or murmurs of the dreamer?*If she did believe in souls (maybe, who knew, it was something she'd have to grow up a little to form an opinion on), she would say that Anne's spoke to her through her eyes.**It is an old story. One of the oldest. They would not have had to travel so far just to learn it: Lust\u2014open, naked lust\u2014must be named and punished. How else can we hope to keep the world in order? *I never did find that song 'about a woman who learns of her lover's infidelities from the endearments he speaks in his sleep.' If anyone knows I'd be thankful if they told me. **Basically this whole paragraph about her eyes and how she could never describe them. I spent the whole section aww-ing.",
            "Sometimes I really want to write poetry, but I can't because I don't know anything about poetry. And then I think, Maybe I should just write it as prose. You know, just not break it up into little short lines. As I was reading Pages for You it occurred to me that Sylvia Brownrigg had done something similar with this novel. The chapters are quite short, usually only about a page and a half, each chapter clearly has its own theme, and they make liberal use of metaphor, description, and idiom, yet\u2014as their short length would imply\u2014with a certain amount of sparseness and economy.Recently I read Brownrigg's first novel, The Metaphysical Touch, and while I liked it fine, I found it a bit gimmicky, overdone, and overly long. Pages for You is its opposite, a simple girl-meets-girl, girl-gets-girl, girl-loses girl (not a spoiler, it's on the first page) story that succeeds on the authenticity of its emotions. Do you want to hear about the thrill of pursuit and seduction? The self-discovery that accompanies it? The rush of infatuation? The pain of heartbreak? If this all sounds OK to you, you might enjoy this poetic ode to being young and in love.",
            "Although the subject matter is like most romance novels, the writing fools you and leaves you feeling breathless. It's like you are Flannery, falling in love with Tuesday Anne. Absolutely beautiful. ",
            "Very good style of writing. The ending ruined it all. The end. ",
            "It wasn't that she wanted the coffee, no. That wasn't it. Rather, she wanted to be the coffee: she envied the dark drink its chance to taste those lips. -- page 9The first great book I've read this year (and we're only a week into it!), I'd like to thank my local library for recently obtaining a copy of Pages For You and prominently displaying it at their fiction shelves. I don't think I would have otherwise heard of this book and/or author Sylvia Brownrigg.Apparently set just before the Internet / cell-phone / LGBTQ acceptance era of the mid- to late 90's, Pages follows college freshman Flannery Jansen - a tall, blonde, slightly tomboyish small-town West Coast transplant - as she enters her first semester as an 'undeclared' student at a university in New England. Early on she stops for breakfast at a local diner and is thunderstruck by another patron during a brief 'meet cute' interaction. This is Anne Arden, a worldly-looking /-seeming twenty-eight year-old teaching assistant from the same university's literature department. (Anne is described as having cat-like green eyes, auburn hair, and a sly voice.) Flannery is immediately awed by Anne.During the autumn their paths cross repeatedly but platonically in and around campus until the Thanksgiving holiday break. Flannery composes a deeply romantic but mature and well-written poem for Anne (titled Pages For You) to express her true feelings, and slips it to her as Anne departs for New York City by train. A day later, as Flannery is settling into a stretch of boredom, she receives a phone call from Anne - I think you'd better come to New York. Cue the lightning strike!Sparks fly and fireworks explode as the relationship begins with the usual but joyous lust / love. (One chapter starts with The year's coldest days were the hottest she had ever lived. Good Lord!) Very sensual and irresistible without being graphic, tawdry, or overly explicit, Pages For You was addictive reading as Brownrigg details the blossoming affair between Flannery and Anne during the school year. Written in short, spirited chapters, I was completely and immediately wrapped up in the story of these two women. That these characters also intelligently discuss and reference books, poetry, and writing - their shared common interests - in their conversations made said story all the better.But ultimately and unfortunately there is not a generic or standard story-book happy ending to the relationship. Some realistic problems, annoyances, and issues start to creep in and cause trouble, and I think (though some reviewers have disagreed) the book was stronger for going in this direction.This is not the type of book I usually read (but then neither was Patricia Highsmith's The Price of Salt and I loved that one, too) but I found that it simultaneously grabbed me by the heart while also hitting me in the gut and engaging my mind. There are not many fiction book that do that to me.",
            "Oh, where do I even start? This book is utterly amazing. Dare I even say that it's a masterpiece? I just love Brownrigg's style of writing, meticulous use of language and how she brings the sensuality of her words alive in this book. It's simply so refreshing to read. The plot, characters and pace were perfect (maybe partly because I can relate to Flannery and her feelings). I want to talk about them passionately, in more detail but I know that if I do, I won't stop, especially if I start with Anne Arden.I especially enjoyed the book's sense of humour. Also, I went through such a range of emotions while reading this book. Mostly I couldn't stop smiling while I read it and I honestly couldn't put it down! My heart ached deeply for the characters in the poignant parts of the book. I even remember cupping my hand over my mouth, gasping at a certain point and crying out, as if it would somehow prevent inevitable poignancy from occurring. There aren't many books that have moved me in the way that Pages for You has. I feel like my words aren't even adequate to explaining how amazing I think this book is. It's inexplicable.Brownrigg is definitely a very talented writer. Or maybe that's an understatement. I just feel so frustrated that I can't adequately voice how this book and her writing make me feel! I'm so glad and grateful for the existence of Pages for You. It's a truly beautiful, unforgettable and unique book that I will always cherish. Thank you, Sylvia Brownrigg, thank you.",
            "Flannery, a 17 year old college student, falls in love with Anne a lecturer at her university. Split into three sections this novel shows the longing, the affair, and the affair's decline. Sometimes overwritten, I was interested in these two characters, but it was just too much of the same: literature, lust, love. It became a very claustrophobic read, and not in a way that made me think that was clever - just a little irritating. "

            "There are books that seduce you by the first chapter. This book claimed my heart on the first page.There are twenty three poems and short stories that take eroticism and throw it to the winds, letting it fall wherever it may. These short pieces and pearls of poetry take in gay, straight, lesbian and everything in between and craft moving tales and thoughts that both arouse and make you think about what you are reading. To me, it was a love story, a gift to the reader that appreciates fine writing and not your typical episodes of BDSM.The short works of fiction in this collection blew my mind. They are windows into worlds that some of us never imagine we could be a part of. Isn\u2019t that the true gift of reading, or writing for that matter? The ability to read something and go somewhere far, far away from the screaming kids, the endless day at work, or doing the supper dishes. As an author, the greatest joy I have is in writing something that invokes that feeling, and Elissa Wald did just that. This book was one of the most engaging reads I have read in quite awhile. Think brilliant primary colors. Think carnival lights and swarthy men with tattoos. Think sex.From the first story, The Initiation, where we meet Delilah, a budding submissive who struggles with the demons inside her, to the sexy Kim who isn\u2019t quite sure what to make of Delilah\u2019s fixation on pain. This story was gripping and visceral and I couldn\u2019t put the book down, even to sleep. The second story installment is Ruby and the Bull. This is the story of Ruby and Judd. She calls him the Bull, and as the story unwinds, he has found her diary and is about to get a nasty shock when he reads it. Spicy, raw and undulating, this tale is gritty and on edge.The third story in the collection is The Resolution. Full of the glitz and fading glitter of the big top, we meet Lottie, a runaway and Jorge, an outcast in the circus. Teased mercilessly for his gay status, Jorge is bitter and standoffish. When Lottie unknowingly insults him, it starts a winding path down a love that will last a lifetime. This story will bring tears to your eyes and a breath of longing to your heart.Story number four, The Houseboy, is a major head trip and one that had me thinking about it even when I wasn\u2019t reading it. Troy is a boy lost in a sea of high schoolers lost in the fray of his life. When the Sergeant comes to speak, he finds a role model and a curious object of affection. Writing letters and insinuating himself into the Sergeant\u2019s life, lies and betrayals can unravel even the deepest of dreams.Number five, Missing the Boat, is a m\u00e9nage scenario that brings many elements to the scene. Dominance, submission and more entertain in this soul deep take on friendship and fascination when the tables get turned and lines begin to blur.The sixth story, Turned Out, is a beautiful story about hope growing up from a bed of concrete. Nelson has just gotten out of prison and while he is happy, his senses are on overload. He misses the routine and security of the life inside and the domineering partnership he shared with The Axe, the male dominant he subbed to inside. This piece walks you through deep feelings and longings of the heart.The last story, The Illustrating Man, is one that will stick in your mind long after you have read it. Sexy and as intricate as a well done tattoo, this story takes off when a female reporter finds out a childhood savior is wanted for murder. In a beautifully wound tale, the author shows you people that were affected by the artist\u2019s insight and unique method of tattooing. It is sensual and one that scratches down into the deepest part of you and leaves a mark.The poetry in this collection is also inspiring, spiritual and evocative.If you are looking for a book that takes you into the souls of many unique and worthy characters, then you need to read this collection. Rich, lush and full of vibrant eroticism, this book is a keeper on my favorite shelf. You won\u2019t forget any of the characters and how easily this author can slip into the minds of anyone and walk a mile in their shoes. The erotic portions are done very well and titillate the mind as well as the body.For a collection that will have you dreaming carnival dreams of tattooed men, ladies that lust and of heartfelt loves that like life, do not always have a sparkling happily ever after, then you need to read this book.Originally posted at: http://www.longandshortreviews.com/bo...",
            "An easy and entertaining read. Not highly erotic, it's more a defiance to the idea that those who crave affection in a darker way are any less human. A good, light start for beginners to the BDSM literary scene. I could have read it all in one sitting, but paced myself so I could enjoy it. I agree with some critics that some of it isn't entirely realistic, but a touch of fantasy has never bothered me. I've read it twice and I'm sure I'll do so again not too far in the future. ",
            "The intro poem and first two stories are weak, but the rest of the book is pretty solid. Definitely an interesting read for anyone curious about the submissive mind. But the stories themselves are not about simple submission/domination fantasies, they deal with (more or less) believable characters in different positions and that's what makes it a good read.",

            "This book seeks the point of contact between the history of two of the biggest American industries in the seventeenth, eighteenth and nineteenth centuries: slavery and the whaling, particularly in New England. It focuses on dynamics between sailors and captains on whaling ships, and between the sailors themselves. Though whaling was by no means a perfect occupation, demanding endless work under brutal and dangerous conditions for little compensation, it offered one of the few forms of income available to free and runaway slaves and other non-white workers. While most non-white whalers (and a lot of white ones, too) lived a life of daily struggle for survival, some black whalers came to own whaling ships and accumulated quite a bit of wealth. Black Hands, White Sails describes the lives of many who struggled and the few who succeeded.This book jumps around a bit. I think if the organization were more compelling I would have given it a five. There's a lot of important and fascinating information about the multicultural dynamics on whaling ships, the complex relations between white Quaker whaling captains and their often non-white sailors and whalers, and some of freed slaves, relatives of freed slaves, and other non-white individuals who managed to up-end the many obstacles in the way of prosperity and create for themselves an independent means of wealth.

            "McKissack, P., &amp, McKissack, F.L. (1999). Black Hands, White Sails: The story of African-American whalers. New York: Scholastic Press.0590483137Black Hands, White Sails considers the history of whaling in the United States with special attention to the experiences of African American and in relation to major events that have shaped American history. For example, did you know one of the five killed at the Boston Massacre was a mulatto man named Crispus Attucks? That\u2019s a detail I don\u2019t remember being included in my grade school history textbooks.In this Coretta Scott King book, the McKissacks patiently give accounts of multiple escaped slaves, free blacks and supportive whites famous or otherwise and their experiences with whaling. Among those stories included, is a partial account of the famous orator Frederick Douglass.Black Hands White Sails extends out to emphasize the experience of a new sailor or greenie (due to all the sea sickness), where they\u2019d sleep, the jobs they and other crew members would have, the shanties they would sing, the terms and superstitions common etc. While there is a description of the layout of a general whaling ship, a diagram would have been nice. (There are a number of old photos included, however)I found one of the most amusing part of the book was the list of \u201cwhalemen\u2019s commandments\u201d:1. \u201cSteal but not from a friend2. Lie but never about anything important.3. Fight anytime you think you can win.4. Run when you think you can\u2019t win.5. Cheat before you get cheated6. Swear but never in front of a good woman.7. Drink as much as you can hold.8. Love as many women as you can catch.9. Never tattle.10. Never volunteer\u201d (pp. 90-91).I don\u2019t know how I feel about number eight there, but other than that I\u2019m pretty amused. Turns out whalers are just as cool as the old school pirates.Activities to do with the book:This information book can help give a new more minority-friendly perspective on American history. It includes information on the Underground Railroad, the slave trade, the civil war, etc.For young adult students, it could be paired with lessons of Moby Dick, especially since the book spends a number of pages giving accounts of real whaling ships that had experiences that most likely inspired Herman Melville. It could also be paired with some of Frederick Douglass\u2019s writings. For younger ships who are still hooked on the Pirates of the Caribbean movies, the vocabulary and superstition section will probably hold a lot of appealThis would be a good recommendation for students to go through when working on research projects.Fun projects that a teacher could use if they assign students to read this book include researching and making a list of other groups/cultures \u2018 superstitions, write their own sea shanties,Favorite Quotes:\u201cThere is no evidence that the Indians ever endeavored to make whaling a business venture. But the colonists did right away. And black men were a part of the process from the beginning\u2014first as slave laborers, then as freemen\u201d (p. 2).\u201cWhen someone wanted to describe a man who was bold, strong, and wildly daring, they referred to him as a \u201cNantucket Whaleman\u201d\u201d (p. 15).\u201cIt didn\u2019t matter what color the hands were that handled the sails or pulled the oars. The rules were clear. All men had to work together if they were to survive. This reality is what earned blacks respect, or at least they were tolerated, even though they were not always accepted\u201d (p. 16).\u201cIt wasn\u2019t likely that a man who had hunted a creature 400 times his size would not have a sense of self-pride. He usually held his head a little higher and pulled his shoulders back a little farther\u201d (p. 26).For more of my reviews, visit sjkessel.blogspot.com.",
            "This book was very interesting to read. As I read this book it made me think about a alot. Not only African American history, but history in general. Many things happened through time that shaped history arround. The meaning of history through this book became more broad to me. History is in us and we are history. I would reccomend this book to anyone who is very interested in history and who wants to learn more about history.This book is about black sailors who have black slaves working on a ship. These black slaves work very hard on the ship day in and day out. The sailors go through a lot of issues with other countries and other things that are being taken placed. One slave has to learn how to be a good whailor and how to run a ship proper. This ship is full of slaves leaving from the Americans. In the end this slave turned whailor gets respect and friendship from his other peers on the ship.",
            "This is a fascinating book about the history of whaling in the United States, focusing on the role of African American whalers. Some of my favorite parts were the description of life on board the boats, the dangers and back-breaking work, and the pastimes on the ships. I especially enjoyed the description of the typical sailor, with corn rows and tattoos! The book was very interesting, especially learning about the vocabulary we've gained (slang and other) from the whalers. I heartily recommend this book for anyone who enjoys reading the history of everyday lives and events.",

            " Everyone needs some fun every once in a while. Kathleen thinks that she has too much responsibility at home and doesn't have time for fun or time to volunteer as a Pink Angel with her friends. Lurlene McDaniel's Angels in Pink (Kathleen's Story) kept me on the edge of my seat with the constant action and different points of view by the different characters. Kathleen McKensie's home life is not the kind of life that anyone would want to trade theirs for. Her mother, Mary Ellen, has multiple sclerosis (MS) and can barely take care of herself. Kathleen got put as Mary Ellen's care taker at the age of five and never has any time to do anything for herself. She has no time to act like other girls her age do. When Kathleen's two best friends, Holly and Raina, persuaded her to join a volunteer program at Parker-Sloan General Hospital as a Pink Angel, Kathleen thought that this was going to be an awful summer and worried a lot about the health of her mother who was left at home by herself. Later, Kathleen finds out that this program is just what she needs to break out of her shell and have a little fun. Lurlene McDaniel moves from one of the main characters to the next in every chapter. I like this style of writing because the book is not as boring with all of the different events going on with each character. The drawback to this style is the confusion that the reader gets from each chapter. The different chapters confused me because they didn't seem to fit together until I read on a few more chapters and the chapters before were all summed up. Lurlene's type of writing is more serious and realistic than funny. There are a few funny parts in her stories, but most of her story seems very realistic than comical. When i read Angels in Pink, it seemed as if i was really in the hospital and at the characters houses witnessing all of the action because the descriptions of the settings were very elaborate.  Kathleen didn't like talking about her home life to other people besides Holly and Raina. Most of the time, though, she didn't want to talk to them about her situations at home, either. Mary Ellen was my least favorite character because she was always so needy and complained way to much. She always wanted Kathleen to do everything for her and Kathleen had to stop everything she was doing to make her mother happy. If Kathleen came home a little later than planned from the hospital or from running an errand, Mary Ellen would get very emotional. On Kathleen's first day at the hospital, the orientation went a little longer than she thought it would. When she walked in she saw that her mother had been crying. When she saw Kathleen she said I was scared. I - I thought something bad had happened to you. Then she refused to eat unless Kathleen was right there eating beside her.  I recommend this book to people who like books that make the reader feel like part of the story. Also Angels in Pink is a good book for people who have interests in personal, realistic books.",

            "This book was absolutely amazing! I love Kathleen and Carson together and their bond is amazing! I love they work at a hospital because it teaches me new cures and things I have never seen before. Kathleen\u2019s mom disability is a struggle but as a team they help her get through it. This book was incredible, and I definitely want to read the next one!",
            "This book was really good! Spoilers!I don't like that Kathleen is so insecure. I'm glad that Holly was able to be friends with Ben, and that he got better. I didn't like that Holly's dad was so controlling, even though he only is because he cares. I don't like the character Stephanie, because she always seems to turn up when things are going well for Kathleen. Plus, when she shows up, it makes Kathleen insecure again. I like that they (Raina, Kathleen, and Holly) all volunteer at the hospital. I also like that they all help each other through whatever they are going through. I didn't like it that Kathleen found her mom on the floor when she came home. I liked that Carson was able to help her mom and calm Kathleen a little. I don't like that Kathleen's mom is so controlling, but she got better. This book was a quick read! This is also a series. ",
            " This book is about three girls Raina, kathleen, and Holly, who join a summer volunteer program at Parker-Sloan General Hospital. Holly works done in the Childrens wing reading and doing crafts with all the children. Raina works as a runner. Moving patients to surgerys and getting them medicine and food, things like that. Lastly Kathleen works in the office center by filing papers. During the volunteer program Kathleen meets the nauthiest boy namedd Carson and doesn't always want to be attracted to him, but she is.  The Genre of this book is realistic fiction/Romance and the theme of this book is book is friendship/Passion.  Overall, I think this book was really great, but there were a few things that I would change. (1) I think the Characterization was good on the three main charaters Holly, Kathleen, and Holly, but on the minor characters such as Holly's brother/Raina Boyfriend (Same person just to let you know) I would like to know more about his physical appearance. (2) The suspence and foreshadowing in this novel was just okay. I believe that suspence should be a main priority when writing a story, because it takes a part in getting the reader addicted to your book. In Angels in Pink I could predict a lot of things that were going to happen (Forshadowing)and in some novels it is kind of fun,but in this one it was just eennnnnh. (3) The last element I would critique about this book is during the plot, the falling action to be exact, was pretty dull. I wish it was a little more exiting because I put down the book a lot during that part. (I'd like to tell you exactly what happened, but it would give away the entire story.) People who would enjoy this book would be girls of any age between about 13-25. I picked such an older age because there is a lot of drama younger girls, I don't think, would understand. Lastly I would give this book 5 stars because even though I didd critique three things it was very hard to. Overall, I wish every girl between the age of 13-25 would read this book, because it totally, wonderfully, amazingly awesome!!!!!!!!!!!!!",
            "Kathleen is struggling between home and her outside life. She's the main caregiver to her wheelchair-bound mother, her mom has multiple sclerosis. When Kathleen was seven years old, her Dad died in a car crash when hit by a drunken driver, and Mom spent months in the hospital recuperating from her injuries. While Kathleen struggles with guilt when she is away from Mom, She feels like that she should be home taking care of her instead of out having fun with her friends.Holly looks to the volunteer program as an escape from strict but devoted parents. Raina's interest in the medical field comes from her Mom, who is the director of nursing at the hospital. Kathleen doesn't really want to do it, because she says she would rather get a paying job instead of wasting her time at some hospital.She is assigned to the admissions office with clerical duties and responsibility for transporting patients. She meets this attractive volunteer Carson Keifer, who attends the prestigious Bryce Academy. Others consider Carson self-centered, conceited, and unreliable. His parents, Christopher and Teresa Keifer, are cardiologists at Parker-Sloan General, a sister is an ophthamologist in Bosnia, and his brother is a medical resident in Detroit. Carson has no interest in medicine. Kathleen and Carson form a relationship, he takes her out to dinner at the country club, and invites her to the Keifer residence. But there's a rival (so Kathleen thinks) in Stephanie, a drop-dead beautiful model with a 'brassy attitude', who seems to appear out of nowhere. Returning home after a date,Kathleen and Carson notice that all of the lights are off in the McKensie house. Rushing into the kitchen, they find Mom on the floor, with no pulse. As Carson administers CPR, Kathleen calls 911, and Mom is transported to the hospital.This shows the love of Kathleen's friends, their parents, and people at the hospital.This is a fun, interesting book and i think that every girl will be happy reading this. There's a lot of drama involved and its fun because you can relate to it, and you can see which one out of the girls is you. "

So in 1839 as the former Princess becomes the newly crowned Queen Victoria (1837) , ruling England Flashman gets a different occupation also, ruling a saddle, enters a cavalry regiment under the legendary incompetent Lord Cardigan. An unwanted duel with a very unfriendly chap occurs, yet honor must be preserved at any cost. Harry is petrified and can't think of any way to skip this big honor. Soon afterwards forced to marry an innocent , pretty though not bright girl, Elspeth he seduced. Her relatives demand this and wanting to stay conscious ...agrees, lacking fortitude in his character a church wedding naturally transpires. Sent not willingly to India and then Afghanistan to fight a horrific war, sounds familiar ? Flashman doesn't believe in or care about his greatest objective is to remain alive. The British flee Kabul when the local tribes gather in the countless thousands to drive out the invaders, the luckless Harry is once again led by another incompetent General Elphinstone, disaster follows the British army as they dwindle in numbers trying to escape, unfortunately both he and the lord were historical figures, God save the Queen. The exciting vicious battle in a small fort as the desperate Flashman and a few others are surrounded by angry Afghans seeking revenge for the many insults and offences they have endured from the British, foreigners are hated here owing to good reasons.   With swords in hand, Afghans slice anyone in their way, gore is not unknown, somehow through luck or skill survives his many adventures, Harry showing his true colors, becoming sick, tired of fighting... rather be with the beautiful women nearby, he will try to charm. War or peace his nature doesn't vary an iota , lusting for the unattainable . Wishing to be back in calm England, having pleasurable situations, will anyone disparage his sentiments ? Since the adept George MacDonald Fraser wrote twelve of these diverting books you can guess if our friend lives to experience other adventures and boast about them to his family an acquaintances maybe not too accurate but nevertheless quite entertainingly. A sense of fun and amusement flows all through this lively tale of the unlikely protagonist or antagonist if you prefer, depending how you feel about Lieutenant Flashman he is not perfect far from it, but a more realist view of soldiers. An officer and a gentleman they're not, most are tough fighters doing the dirty work the politicians clamor for but keep their own clothes clean. This unchanging custom continues today for better or worse."

            "This is the first book of the Flashman papers, much-loved by many. It purports to be the memoirs of a Victorian officer. In this book, he serves in Afghanistan and India. The cover art encapsulates the plot and tone.A rake\u2019s adventures  Harry Flashman is a self-aware, shameless, shrewd, cowardly opportunist who describes himself as \u201cA scoundrel, a liar, a cheat, a thief, a coward - and, oh yes, a toady.\u201d (Note that he doesn\u2019t mention his treatment of women.) He joins up, fights, escapes, sleeps around, betrays honour, friends, fellow officers, and even his country, beats servants \u201cfor their own good and my amusement\u201d, beds more women, is tortured, duels, double-crosses, takes hostages, is taken hostage\u2026 yada yada\u2026 rinse and repeat - not necessarily in that order. I found it a little dull after a while. However, I guess this is what fans enjoy - especially those who wish, perhaps against their true scruples, they could be Flash. It\u2019s well written, and Flashman is a complex and believable character. He feels authentic for his time and place. I disapprove of him more than intended, but he\u2019s disarmingly honest about his dishonesty, immorality, and other faults. Although I was not charmed and beguiled very much, I was not as outraged as I thought I might have been.The conceit of a real historic record This book claims to be Flashman\u2019s memoirs, written between 1900 and 1905, and found in 1965. Its supposed authenticity is enhanced by footnotes tying his account to real people and events, plus a glossary. One of the notes even says his account clears up a longstanding historical mystery. When it was published in 1969, some thought it was what it claimed - despite Flashman explicitly being the same Flashman as the bully in the (fictional) Tom Brown's School Days! George Macdonald Fraser said he wrote it as entertainment, rooted in history, not as satire. He didn\u2019t disapprove of much his antihero did, and often railed against \u201cpolitical correctness gone mad\u201d in interviews and articles. Daisy chainFirst there was Flashman in Tom Brown's Schooldays, then there was the adult Flashman that Macdonald Fraser wrote. But there are also two brilliant comedic caricatures from British TV.Arnold Ace Rimmer, played by Chris Barrie, in scifi comedy Red Dwarf:And Captain Flasheart, played by the late great Rik Mayall, in Blackadder:Marriage, fidelity, and how gender and money lead to hypocrisyThe final chapter was rather different in tone and content, and by far the most engaging to me, though probably not to fans.The (unjustly) feted hero returns home, to his devoted, pretty, naive, and wealthy wife. But it turns out she is not all those things any more, if indeed, she ever was. Flashman is forced to confront uncomfortable truths. The arch-schemer has to find new ways to get what he wants. I was almost (only almost) tempted to find out what happens next. Quotes\u2022t\u201cA noisy drunkard is intolerable, a passive one may do at a pinch. At least, if he has money, money will excuse virtually any conduct in the army nowadays.\u201d\u2022t\u201cSome human faults are military virtues, like stupidity, and arrogance and narrow-mindedness.\u201d\u2022t\u201cThere isn\u2019t any folly a man won\u2019t contemplate if there\u2019s money or a woman at stake.\u201d\u2022t\u201cAlways\u2026 be civil to anyone who might ever be of use to me.\u201d\u2022t\u201cIf you have money a wife need be no great encumbrance.\u201d\u2022t\u201cThere is great pleasure in catastrophe that doesn\u2019t touch you.\u201d\u2022t\u201cIt calls for nice judgement, this art of bragging, you must be plain, but not too plain, and you must smile only rarely, letting them guess more than you say is the kernel of it, and looking uncomfortable when they compliment you.\u201d\u2022t\u201cI managed to rape her\u2026 I prefer willing women.\u201d He says it\u2019s the only time he raped a woman. Not imo.An objective 3.5* book, with 2.5* enjoyment for me, averaging at 3*.I don\u2019t get on with audiobooks, but I can\u2019t help feeling this might work better listening to a master storyteller\u2026 \ud83d\ude09",
            "How do we distinguish between the author and the characters he writes? There are readers who assume that if a main character does something racist or sexist, that means the author is, too. But then, characters can also transform into cockroaches, commit interplanetary genocide, and die gloriously in a hail of bullets without the author having to undergo those experiences, himself.Even in an autobiography, the author still isn't writing himself--he's writing one biased version, crafting coherent stories and meanings out of the messy aggregate of daily life. But even in works of pure, fantastical fiction, some authors reveal more of themselves than others.For the most inexperienced author, their main character will be a reflection of how they view themselves. They know what the author knows, like what they like, and have the same faults an strengths--or more precisely, the character will have the traits the author imagines they possess (plus a few they wish they had).On one hand, this is an easy character to write, because all the author has to do is place themselves in the situation and imagine what they would do. Unfortunately, this creates a fundamental problem for the author, since they have to create all the conflicts--how do you create a problem that you don't know how to solve? It becomes a game of tic tac toe against yourself--the only way either side could win is by accident. In such books, you can predict that any problem that crops up will be solved within the same chapter.In stories like this, it's common for authors to simply put their own opinions into the mouths of the main characters, and to put opposing opinions into the mouths of the 'bad guys', a la Ayn Rand. This is a silly, unconvincing technique, because the implications drawn are completely false. You can't say 'the villain kills babies and is socialst, therefore socialism is evil', because that doesn't actually demonstrate any connection between the two activities.A slightly more sophisticated author will intentionally create a character who is more naive than them (at least, to start out with). Then they can have the character make the same mistakes the author used to make when they were younger, before they figured things out. Part of the popularity of the bildunsroman ('growing up story') is that it's easy to think up conflicts and solutions for adolescent characters.Authors who operate on this level can't just put their lengthy monologues in the mouth of the hero, because the hero is too naive to have everything figured out. Instead, they leave the speeches to a wise mentor figure, who stands in for all that is good, and who may be recognized in the unremitting slurry of kindly, ironical wizards in much modern fantasy.But if a writer is self-aware and pays attention to the world, they will eventually realize that what makes people interesting is that they are flawed, troubled, and struggle through life. They will start exploring different sorts of people, people who are very unlike them, people who might disagree with them fundamentally, but who are still interesting and sympathetic.But there's still a steep hill to climb for authors who want to write characters unlike themselves. Few authors have the grasp of psychology necessary to write a realistic character who is fundamentally different from them, so most authors just cobble together some strong character cliches and play them up. But even if he is capable of sticking to the personality he chooses, he risks giving himself away in other ways.An author might create a sexist character, who constantly says and does sexist things, but that isn't damning--authors often explore deeply-flawed characters. The real problem is if the narration and structure begin to support those same conclusions. If a character calls someone a 'slut', that could just be an expression of how real people sometimes speak. If the narration actually refers to a character by that slur, we have a problem--where is that judgment coming from, if not the author?It's often a problem with genre authors, who try their hardest to make strong female characters, making other characters speak self-consciously about the power and strength of women, but then completely undermining all of that by never actually having the women do anything active or make any important decisions. Narrative descriptions of women are lengthy, in florid, sexualized terms--even when there is no male present in the story to appreciate them. Men, contrarily, may never have their face or eye color mentioned.In the case of Flashman, we have another complexity at play. Our main character is often despicable, unsympathetic, sexist, racist, and rarely deserves the victories he gets. But the entire story is from his perspective--there is no all-seeing narrator voice to tell us what's going on. All the views, all the descriptions come from Flashman, himself.Whenever an author completely veils himself behind the character, we must decide what to believe--this technique is called the 'unreliable narrator', for obvious reasons. Sure, Flashy is a selfish coward who beats his servants, but does that mean Fraser is for cowardice? Is he arguing for toadyism and self-promotion over all?Certainly, Flashman recognizes that, according to social ideals, he is not a good man, nor a deserving one--but then, he is surrounded by important, influential men who are even worse than he is. It shouldn't be a surprise to anyone that unpleasant people often end up on top of the totem pole, and never get their comeuppance, but that can be a rather depressing message.Luckily, in this tale of rollicking adventure, the message is delivered with thick humor and irony, not dour nihilism. If money and fame are doled out regularly to the most foolish and detestable of our race, perhaps it is because only the foolish and detestable desire them enough to keep seeking them. Most worthwhile people will end up too distracted by positive human relationships and personal growth to continue self-possessed social climbing for long enough.Happily, our dear Flashy has no such hangups. Throughout the ceaseless, rousing, ridiculous tale of Victorian colonial mishaps, he rarely fails to disappoint. Yet I kept finding myself sympathizing with him--at times guiltily. I knew he deserved punishment, but I didn't actually want to watch it administered. I didn't want the ol' chap to suffer.It just goes to show that we'll always feel more attached to the rascal we know well than to the saint we've never met. And while he's not apologetic, at least he doesn't suffer from the terrible mental disability of the average internet commentator, who cannot critique stupidity and hypocrisy without being a stupid hypocrite, himself. Flashman may be many unsavory things, but he's no hypocrite. He not only accepts his cowardice, he clings to it like a lifeline--which in fact it often is. He is not, like all the men he serves under, a fool with grand pretensions--he is merely a fool, and glad enough to remain one as long as life's grip holds.Fraser's Victorian is meticulously researched, and his footnotes are often funnier than his witty banter--mostly because all the most absurd parts of his stories are completely true. Overall, he reminded me of the experience of reading The Three Musketeers--a nonstop adventure full of odd characters and occurrences, with life and death always at the next shake of the cup.Yet there was something of Conrad's The Duel, too--with humor and absurdity often rubbing shoulders with dire consequences and the horrors of war. The return march of the army through the snowy crags of Afghanistan brought me back to Conrad's harrowing depiction of the French invasion of Russia--and the dwindling return of that broken army, immortalized starkly in Minard's famous image.Creating a sympathetic antihero is a difficult task--particularly when they aren't of the violent, ass-kicking variety--but Fraser displays why flawed, unusual characters will always trump a flat romantic hero. Like The Virginian or The Moonstone, this is another exciting, surprisingly touching piece of fun which easily outstrips the limitations of its genre.",
            "The Flashman books are written as satire of the classic Victorian schoolboy / military character. They are presented as the compiled memoir, looking back across his life at the age of around 80, written by Flashman. The original Flashman character is taken from the book 'Tom Brown's Schooldays' by Thomas Hughes, where he was the school bully.Flashman's story here (and the remainder of the series, I understand), is bedded in accurate history. The main characters and events are all real, just with Flashman embedded in them. It is incredibly clever, and well pulled off. No getting around it, Flashman - is a horrible character. He is a caricature of all the bad parts of your typical British public schoolboy. He is vain, cowardly (and a bully), manipulative, racist, misogynistic and self-entitled. He is a true anti-hero. And yet, the saving grace of all these character flaws, is that he is completely aware of them, and in his story he does nothing to hide them. He willingly lies to the other characters, but not to the reader, and this makes him, in a strange way, a subject for pity.This is the first of the Flashman Papers series, and primarily covers the period 1839 to 1842. As the first book, it outlines his expulsion from Rugby School (similar to the story in Hughes' book, but from Flashman's perspective, he irons out some untruths), and his subsequent enlistment in the Eleventh Light Dragoons. There was clear reasoning in his choosing the Dragoons, as they had recently returned from India, and there was little chance of them being sent back in the near future - cowardly Flashman wanted only to draw his salary and look good in his uniform, not engage in any battles! Events of course transpire such that he must be transferred, and he find himself packed off to India, and henceforth Afghanistan as a herald to Major-General Elphinstone. As we know (me from reading Dalrymple's Return of a King), the first Anglo-Afghan war ended with the entire British garrison be massacred. Flashman, of course, finds a way to survive, and becomes one of only two survivors to make it out of Kabul, and is subsequently invalided back to England, and his young wife.I thought the weaving of history and fiction masterful, and Flashman despicable, however hugely entertaining. I own another three Flashman books, and will continue the series.I must also note that the Flashman character almost certainly provided some inspiration for Lord Flashheart in the Blackadder series.4.5 stars, rounded down.",
            "There's a recurring theme to the reviews I've read of 'Flashman' which is that whilst, by his own happy admission, he is a racist, scoundrel, bully, cad and coward, Flashman is also an engaging storyteller who has the happy coincidence to be an active participant in the middle of momentous historical events. George MacDonald Fraser has done a magnificent job of evoking the Britain, India and Afghanistan of 1839 to 1842, and the literary conceit that what we are reading is the first part of a cache of papers, written by Flashman in old age (between 1900 and 1905), is brilliant, as it allows Flashman to add an occasional commentary to events and put them into perspective. 'Flashman' begins with his expulsion from Rugby school, as described in 'Tom Brown's Schooldays' and ends with his unlikely hero's return home to London following a number of memorable adventures during the retreat from Kabul, the Last Stand at the Battle of Gandamak and the Siege of Jalalabad, during the First Anglo-Afghan War. Afghanistan has a history of humbling armies and Empires.Most of the people Flashman encounters were real people and the history in these books appears to be accurate. 'Flashman' is a wonderful way to learn about history whilst enjoying a ripping yarn that is both funny and gripping. I was delighted to learn that there are 12 books in the series:Flashman (1969)Royal Flash (1970)Flash for Freedom! (1971)Flashman at the Charge (1973)Flashman in the Great Game (1975)Flashman's Lady (1977)Flashman and the Redskins (1982)Flashman and the Dragon (1985)Flashman and the Mountain of Light (1990)Flashman and the Angel of the Lord (1994)Flashman and the Tiger (1999)Flashman on the March (2005)I look forward to reading them.",
            "Flashman was picked as the February book for the NeoGAF bookclub. I thought I would like the adventures of Flashy based on the first few pages. Who wouldn't like a story that starts off with being expelled from Rugby school for drunkenness?Unfortunately, after reading 1/3 of the book, I can't continue. Flashy is an unapologetic ass! I'm usually fine with antiheros, but this one takes it too far. Flashy's treatment of women is awful and while this could be the norm for his time and his class, it doesn't seem realistic that women would just throw themselves at his feet like that.My main gripe with Flashman is not that he's a liar, a coward, a cheat, and misogynist. It's that he never gets his comeuppance. Things always seem to go for the worse, but then turn for the better for him. Considering this is only one book in a series of his exploits, my wish that he gets beaten to a pulp and dies will never come true.My low opinion of the book isn't that it's written poorly. The prose is wonderful and I have to admit the first couple of mini-adventures gave me a chuckle or two, but I'm afraid the subject matter just isn't to my tastes. It reads more like male-fantasy. It reminds me of that asshole you always meet at parties who's always loudly bragging about his last lay."

            "The author was uncanny in the way she was describing the unhealthy, heavy-handed authoritarianism I have encountered is churches I have attended in the past. I seriously wonder what type of character flaw I have that causes me to repeatedly subject myself to such abuse? I believe this book would be helpful for all Christians to read.\u201cSome controlling-discipleship churches make a big deal of \u201cbeing different.\u201d Disciples are taught to differentiate themselves even from Christians in other non-discipling churches. The separation from the world, if there is any, is also extended to most of the churches outside the discipleship. A subtle feeling of superiority and condemnation filters into the thinking of disciples in abusive groups. This separation becomes another means of exerting undue influence over disciples.\u201d- page 179 \u201cCertainly there will always be error in our current churches just as there was in Corinth. We will always need brave Christians to stand up and challenge church leaders who are straying. If we habitually see as divisive those who disagree with or challenge leaders\u2019 actions, we may miss God\u2019s leading. Yes, independent thinkers will often create divisions. Because they may be from God, they are deserving of a reasoned response and careful study.\u201d- page 141Often the leaders do not want their followers to even consider information. Attacking the motives and credibility of a critic is an effective way to accomplish this. When members are conditioned by leaders to believe that information is credible only if the source of that information is acceptable, it is unlikely followers will seriously consider anything said by those ridiculed by the leaders. These victims become putty in the hands of these leaders.- page 144",
            "In the genre of spiritual abuse as is occurs in Christian churches, this book is a significant, bold, concise presentation of abuse in that sphere. The author speaks from both personal experiences and extensive study, and from the wealth of insight gained as an exit counselor for those seeking to leave such groups.Strengths: Personal, clear and concise, excellent treatment of particular bible passages that are routinely used in spiritually abusive churches to control and dominate members. Appropriately challenging to the reader. The author shares very wise counsel regarding the departure from abusive churches. Weaknesses: Targeted so specifically to current members of such groups (ie, IF any of these conditions are true of your church, THEN you are likely in an abusive church...), that it can sound at times like a check-off list presented to the reader. I felt the book might have been more effective if it had been more specifically targeting to the reader who has escaped the abusive church, as opposed to the reader who is still in one. (People who are still supportive of their abusive churches do not see them, cannot see them, as abusive, so would not likely be moved by the author's arguments.) Although it is almost a forgone conclusion today in many Christian churches that every member should enroll in some sort of discipleship or accountability ministry in his/her church, this book leads the reader to seriously re-consider that perspective, and challenges those who hold such convictions to defend them, rather than simply assume them to requirements of a healthy church. I highly recommend this work for all survivors of Christian spiritual abuse, particular those forms of it that operated under the banner of discipleship. I am sure it would also be a very enlightening read for families and friends of members who are actively supporting and belonging to such groups, too. ",
            "Chrnalogar addresses issues of manipulation that too often develop in Christian discipleship relationships. It's an important topic that many believers are blind to. This book definitely got me thinking and processing on my own experiences. However, if I suspected a friend of being in an abusive church or discipleship, this is not the book I would recommend. I found it difficult to follow Chrnalogar's train of thought. Most of the time I could not clearly discern what the topic of each chapter was supposed to be. All her thoughts seemed thrown into chapters at random, with sometimes no clear connection between one paragraph and the next. Leaving me, the reader, feeling mentally puzzled and confused. Vitims of spiritual abuse already experience confusion about their experiences. Understanding those experiences should bring clarity not more confusion. The title is also a misnomer. Although the twisting and misinterptationtation of scripture is a repeated topic, the main focus of this book is manipulation in discipleship."

            "Even on vacation, Sophie can't catch a break. Between another scheme hatched by Natasha, a garden party that goes wrong, and finally a resolution to Wolf's missing wife, Sophie is run ragged. This is an entertaining series with a likable protagonist, entertaining secondary characters, a good dose of humor, and engaging mysteries. This book had a lot going on with several mysteries to solve and plenty of plot twists to keep the reader on their toes. I will definitely be continuing with this series to see what the author has in store for Sophie's future. Even Natasha is starting to grow on me a little bit and I look forward to her next hijinx."

            "Oh my! This one centers around the big mystery of Sophie's boyfriend's life, with series-changing results. ",
            "This series is one of my favorites, each mystery keeps getting better and better and the characters are all amazing. THis book was no let down, mixing an old disappearance with a new murder it was action-packed from the get-go!Sophie was once again a level-headed character who doesn't mince her words and for this mystery we get to see a lot more of her friend, and across the street neighbor, Nina, and her next door neighbor and friend, Francie helping her with her sleuthing. I was actually wondering where Francie had been when I read the last book, so I'm very glad the author brought her back and put her in a more prominent role with this book.Wolf was also a much bigger character in this book, because of the simple fact that half of the mystery revolved around him. I actually didn't care for Wolf that much in this book. I think Ms. Davis did a wonderful job of showing how he and most people would act under his circumstances, but I just really felt like he was rude to Sophie at times in this book.The mystery was stellar. It combines old and new and the ending was a total surprise, I never expected what happened until it took place.Overall a very good book, with a semi-cliffhanger ending. I really can't wait to read the next one and see how Ms. Davis ties up these loose ends!",
            "Another good entry in the Diva series. this story takes Sophie and her friends to the home of a wealthy acquaintance where several murders and attempted murders abound. Good characters and a good plot make this a good read. ",
            "The Diva books are not easy to put down, Krista Davis has a way of ending her chapters with just a morsel that has you saying, \u201cwell, just a little bit more\u201d and soon you are up way past your bedtime finding out what Sophie and Natasha are up to.All Sophie Winston wanted was a nice backyard vacation, no work for two weeks. A peaceful and quiet time with her gardening and pets, she works hard, that should not be too much to ask for. All that changed when Mona charges into her backyard and demands that she find her missing daughter.Nope not going to happen, even though Sophie has helped in investigations in the past, she is not a detective. If only life were that simple.While trying to do a good deed and plant a rosebush in her boyfriend Wolf\u2019s backyard, Sophie unearths the purse of Wolf\u2019s missing wife. All along, she has known that Anne just disappeared one day, but the realization that without a body, Wolf is still married has hit her hard. What is she to do? She knows that there is no way that the man she loves could be responsible for this act but there are too many unanswered questions. Add in Natasha\u2019s fame addiction, a home improvement show trying to add a garage to Sophie\u2019s back yard, the curious goings on with Roscoe, his new wife, his ex-wife, his housekeeper, his son and the son\u2019s fianc\u00e9e. I know that sounds a bit complicated, but Krista Davis has no problem keeping everyone straight for the reader. The longed for vacation is but a dream.Another reviewer has called this a transitional book and I could not agree more. We, the readers, are not sure what direction Sophie will take. She loves her family, her town, she loves her friends and her pets, but it is now a time for Sophie to open new doors.I love this series, the characters are developing without any shocking changes, well except for one in this book. Who knew that Detective Kenner could be human? The humor runs throughout the book, and just when you think you have it all figured out, there is a wham moment. The multiple storylines have you bouncing back and forth, without any drag or confliction and with returning characters, the reader has a chance to revisit old friends. Great series that is best enjoyed from the beginning, so grab the books, sit out on your patio and enjoy a taste of Old Town sleuthing.",
            "Well, I suppose if you read this series, you had to see this plot line coming. The mystery about Wolf's wife's disappearance is the focal point of this book, along with the strange goings-on in one local family. Lots of upheaval for Sophie in this book.I enjoyed this book quite a bit. The characters are always fun, always interesting. Personally, I'd smack Natasha into next week if I were Sophie, but I guess every cozy has to have a 'nemesis' these days. I really look forward to seeing the next book and reading about the 'aftermath' of all that happened in this book.",

            "The second year of this Civil War series was even better than the first. In this year the war was going with full intensity and many tragic events. The diary entries and letters to family bring into focus the sacrifices, the pressures and complete lack of adequate supplies, food and equipment these soldiers, both Union and Confederate, had to deal with. The descriptions of horrible wounds suffered, limbs severed and field hospital amputations are very graphic at times. The wounded and dead counts after many battles ran over 5,000, some over 10,000, making the casualty numbers hard to visualize. Abraham Lincoln's frustrations with his generals, particularly McClellan, makes you realize just how tenuous the Union's position was. It was the same for the Confederates being undermanned and underequipped. This is a great account of this terrible part of our history and I look forward to reading year three.",

            "This edited volume provides insights, through diaries, newspaper articles, letters, and so on, about the second year of the Civil War. This work follows on the heels of the first year. We get introduced to the thoughts of Abraham Lincoln, Frederick Douglass, George McClellan, Edwin Stanton, Braxton Bragg, Jefferson David, Nathaniel Hawthorne, Herman Melville, Robert E. Lee, and so on. Through their words, we get a sense of what was at stake and how protagonists in the bloody drama of the Civil War thought.The first entry is from January 1862, with Frederick Douglass' article in his own journal. It ends with a series of comments from different actors on January 1, 1863. Lincoln's Emancipation Proclamation is included.All in all, this is a valuable source of first person reflections on the sanguinary struggle. Going through this volume, entry by entry, provides a vivid sense of how individuals saw what was happening.For those interested in the Civil War, this is a genuinely useful item for one's library. "

            "The Civil War: The Second YearIn commemoration of the 150th anniversary of the American Civil War, the Library of America is engaged in an ambitious project: it is publishing a lengthy volume of source material covering each of the four years of the conflict. The first volume covering 1861, The Civil War: The First Year told by Those who Lived it appeared last year 2011. This new volume, The Civil War: The Second Year Told by Those who Lived it (2012) covers the second year of the conflict from January, 1862 through January, 1863. Civil War scholar Stephen Sears edited the volume, selecting the texts, writing and introduction, and introducing each selection with headnotes. Among other things, Sears has written on pivotal events of the War in 1862: the Battle of Antietam and on Union General McClellan's Peninsula Campaign, both of which receive extensive coverage in this book.The book is lengthy and detailed, consisting of 750 pages of close text together with a detailed chronology covering January 1862 -- January 1863, biographical notes on the authors of the texts in the book, and informative notes on the texts and their selection. There are 148 separate selections of which 11 are published for the first time. The authors of the texts range from Abraham Lincoln and Jefferson Davis to little known individuals.Sears presents the entries chronologically. This approach allows the reader to follow the war as it developed and to see its many interrelated and complex threads. Thus the book intersperses the many important battles, in the eastern and western theatres and on the rivers and oceans, with political events. As far as the military history of the war, this presentation allows an overview of the actions on many fronts. In most studies of the conflict, this perspective is difficult to attain. In addition to the documents describing the battles, the book presents the political and social history of the era. In particular, this volume presents texts related to Emancipation and on how it gradually became a major focus of the war. Woven into the texts of this book are statutes such as the second contraband act, deliberations on Emancipation by the press, Lincoln's cabinet and the president himself. the Preliminary Emancipation Proclamation of September 22, 1862, and the Emancipation Proclamation of January 1, 1863. Other entries include editorials and criticism of each step of the process in the papers, military, and by foreign press and governments. In the final entry of the book, dated January 8, 1863, Lincoln writes to a political general, John McClernand, about possible overtures from Southern military leaders to withdraw the Proclamation in exchange for peace. Lincoln wrote: broken eggs can not be mended. I have issued the emancipation proclamation, and I can not retract it.The various entries in the book consist of letters, speeches, diaries, newspaper and magazine articles, memoirs, poems, songs, military reports, and much more. The battles during 1862 were eventful and include Fort Donelson, Shiloh, Iuka, Corinth, Pea Ridge, the fight between the Monitor and the Virginia, the Peninsula Campaign, Second Manassas, Antietam, New Orleans, Perryville, Stones River and more. Sears presents each battle from a variety of perspectives, North and South, from generals and officers to troops in the thick of combat. Some of the sources will be familiar to students of the Civil War while others will be new. The sources in the book are all eyewitness accounts but some consist of memoirs and articles written years after the events they relate.Reading a book of original source material offers both rewards and challenges. There is a great deal of documentation of the war and of 1862. Even a book of the scope of this anthology presents only a well-chosen sample. The book of course lacks the narrative flow of a secondary source -- such as a history -- that would cover this period. The nature of the book makes it more suitable for readers who have lived with and studied the Civil War for a long time rather than to newcomers. Students of the war will be able to place each document and to think about it in context. Nevertheless, Sears' Introduction to the volume, the headnotes to each entry, and the chronology at the end offer guidance and an overview of where the book is heading. These sources offer good guidance to the new reader.Many of the individual entries in this book are highly insightful and revealing. The volume has a powerful cumulative effect when read from cover to cover. I learned a great deal about a subject that has fascinated me for many years and that continues to move many Americans. I look forward to reading the subsequent volumes in this Library of America series.Robin Friedman",
            "It took a while to get through this one. The dang thing is 750 pages and a hell of a read, all primary sources and nicely bound. I think it focused a little too heavily on the Virginia battles, as most civil war books do...I'd also like to say that there are plenty of common folk's memoirs to be accessed. I find it irritating when I only read the viewpoint of the officer or the wealthy. With those caveats in mind, this is a damn amazing read. ",
            "It took me four (4) weeks, but I finally got through this! Not that it was a bad book, rather just the opposite. There is so much rich detail here that it took me this long to read, savor and appreciate what the words were saying. This is not a book that can be read straight through like a story. Instead, it is poetry, congressional acts, editorials and letters -- lots and lots of letters -- from Lincoln to his military, from the military to Lincoln, from cabinet members, from husbands to wives and vice versa, from parents to children and vice versa from brothers to brothers ... These small pieces of literature have been put together to form a chronological history of what occurred in 1862 in relation to the American Civil War.Also, it is important to note that this is volume #2 in a projected 4-volume series -- one for each year of the war.Some things that struck me:Garland H. White was a minister and personal servant of Senator Robert Toombs of Georgia. He escaped before the Civil War and fled to Canada. Although White received no answer to his letter (to Edward M. Stanton), he would later canvas the intire north and west urging my people to inlist and in 1864, became the chaplain of the 28th U.S. Colored Infantry, a regiment White helped recruit in Indiana. White's letter is inspiring because he escaped to freedom, and yet, was willing to come back (to danger) to help fight for a cause that he believed in.The formality of the letters, even between husband and wife -- I don't know when we lost this art, but it's long gone now. From Gen. George B. McClellan -- Commanding Officer of the Army of the Potomac (north) -- At the end of one of his letter's to President Lincoln -- I may be on the brink of eternity and a I hope forgiveness from my maker I have written this letter with sincerity towards you and from love for my country. -- Another thing that struck me from these pieces of correspondence -- the dedication (and I'm not even sure that this is the right word) to one's religion.Some very important Acts of Congress were passed during the war and the First and Second Confiscation Acts were no exception. On August 6, 1861, Congress passed the First Confiscation Act, authorizing the seizure of slaves used to militarily support the rebellion. After months of contentious debate, Congress adopted a Second Confiscation Actin July 1862, authorizing the seizure of slaves and other property from persons found by federal courts to be inciting or aiding rebellion AND although the Second Confiscation Act was rarely enforced, it did serve one valuable purpose -- its passage demonstrated the increasing willingness of Congress to act against slavery.Abraham Lincoln's Address on Colonization was most interesting to read. While some blacks supported colonization, men like Frederick Douglas said it revealed the President's contempt for Negroes and canting hypocrisy and while the project did eventually die away, it brought forth an idea (good or bad) of what to do with the slaves or how best to help the slaves after they were freed. Salmon P. Chase's journal entry for September 2, 1862 states that the cabinet meeting on this date was the most contentious of Lincoln's administration -- it concerned General McClellan and whether or not he should be trusted with high command. You may remember from Doris Kearns Goodwin's book, Team of Rivals that Lincoln gave new meaning to the phrase Keep your friends close and your enemies closer. I would think with the make-up of this cabinet that all of their meetings would be contentious.In a letter from Robert E. Lee to Jefferson Davis in September 1862, Lee talked about his strategic ambitions behind his invasion of Maryland. The mid-term elections in the Northern states Lee sought to influence were due to begin in mid-October. Even though he and his countrymen had seceded from the Union, Lee still wanted to control what was occurring in his former country.As stated in a letter from Samuel W. Fiske aka Dunn Browne to the Springfield Repulican: the combined casualties of the Battle of Antietam reached 22,717 killed, wounded, or missing (Union 12,401, Confederate 10,316), making it the bloodiest single day in American history!Abraham Lincoln's Preliminary Emancipation Proclamation, Proclamation Suspending the Writ of Habeas Corpus -- this act was very interesting, as was the reaction of Congressional Democrats.The number of great authors who not only wrote about the war, but served as abolitionists, etc. was amazing -- in this book alone are pieces by Herman Melville, Nathaniel Hawthorne, Ralph Waldo Emerson, Emily Dickinson and more!The Debate in the Confederate Senate on Retaliation for the Emancipation Proclamation. When the Confederate Senate adjourned on October 13th, it adopted a resolution declaring support for whatever retaliatory measures Jefferson Davis chose to adopt. In a proclamation of December 23, 1862, outlawing Union general Benjamin F. Butler, Davis denounced the Emancipation Proclamation as an effort to excite servile war and ordered Union officers captured while leading freed slaves to be turned over to state authorities for trial. What is really scary is that a Mr. Henry of Tennessee, said that the resolution did not go far enough. He favored the passage of a law providing that upon any attempt being made to execute the proclamation of Abraham Lincoln, we immediately hoist the black flag, and proclaim a war of extermination against all invaders of our soil. Mr. Phelan of Mississippi said that he had always been in favor of conducting the war under the black flag. If that flag had been raised a year ago the war would be ended now.There were also editorials published in foreign papers about our Civil War, including one in the Times of London in October 1862 -- this on the Emancipation Proclamation.In his annual message to Congress in December 1862, Lincoln states I do not forget the gravity which should characterize a paper addressed to the Congress of the nation by the Chief Magistrate of the nation. Nor do I forget that some of you are my seniors, NOR THAT MANY OF YOU HAVE MORE EXPERIENCE THAN I, IN THE CONDUCT OF PUBLIC AFFAIRS. Yet I trust that in view of the great responsibility resting upon me, you will perceive no want of respect to yourselves, in undue earnestness I may seem to display.Also, at the end of this speech, Lincoln said Fellow-citizens , we cannot escape history. We of this Congress and this administration, will be remembered in spite of ourselves. No personal significance, or insignificance, can spare one or another of us. The fiery trial through which we pass, will light us down, in honor or dishonor, to the latest generation. We say we are for the Union. The world will not forget that we say this. We know how to save the Union. The world knows we do know how to save it. We -- even we here -- hold the power, and bear the responsibility. In giving freedom to the slave, we assure freedom to the free -- honorable alike in what we give, and what we preserve. We shall nobly save, or meanly lose, the last best, hope of earth. Other means may succeed, this could not fail. The way is plain, peaceful, generous, just -- a way which, if followed, the world will forever applaud, and God must forever bless. The only thing that I would have changed in the arrangement of this book (and it's almost trivial in nature) would be to move the Biographical Notes -- a veritable who's who in this book to the front. Unfortunately, it is buried in the back between the Chronology and the Notes and I did not find it until I was most of the way through this book.",
            "This is the fifth or sixth anthology published by the Library of America that I have read, and obviously the second on the Civil War. Increasingly, I am finding great joy and value in these works that provide primary sources covering a wide range within given topics. In this particular volume, the following are of note: Military matters, from the actions of individual common soldiers to grand strategy. All point to, and a few soldiers explicitly mention, the vast difference experiencing a battle from the front line compared to the general's eye view back at HQ or in the history books. Both are extremely important and impart valuable knowledge to average citizens today. The reality of battle is described in harrowing detail which every adult and teenage Civil War buff should remember, these were not chess pieces silently moved off a board. On the larger scale, generals have to deal with the infamous fog of war, and McClellan unfortunately gave repeated examples of a general with victory in his grasp losing the opportunity due to unwarranted fear of the enemy's strength and abilities. The entire Peninsula Campaign saw Little Mac complain of lack of reinforcements and that he was constantly outnumbered, when in truth the Army of Northern Virginia was down in men and just barely barring the side door to Richmond itself. Pope could hardly have done worse at Manassas due to his arrogance and belief that the enemy was weaker than they actually were. Antietam provides another example of opportunities lost due to mismanagement and the lack of coordination (Clausewitz's notion of friction coming into play for both sides). Not that all mistakes were made by the Yankees, Braxton Bragg caps the year off with a suicidal and completely predictable charge against Rosecrans at Stones River. Again, average citizens would do well to learn vital military lessons from these pages that we might better understand the limits and compass of military power.Perhaps more interesting is the political aspect of the conflict. In 1862, Britain and France seriously considered brokering a deal between the belligerents in a manner not too dissimilar from what the United States tries to do in broken countries today. But for the timely draw at Antietam, Palmerston might have brought the British fleet to bear upon the blockage, effectively ending the war. And of course we have the issue of slavery. Of great importance in this work are the Second Confiscation Acts and the Emancipation Proclamation, necessary but undoubtedly stretching the powers invested within the President beyond any reasonable reading of the Constitution. Lincoln's desire to emancipate the slaves over a period extending to 1900 and for colonizing freemen to Africa or South America makes a very, very interesting what if for discussion.Pope's General Orders 5, 7, and 11 should be read and contemplated in light of the enemy combatants controversy raging around the Guantanamo Bay prisoners. Also of interest is Lincoln's suspension of Habeas Corpus. A rich book, covering only one year but raising all sorts of social, political, economic, and military matters. It is no surprise to me that my love of those topics can all be traced to becoming a Civil War buff back in early elementary school. As one who has read a few books on the topic, I would highly recommend this to any Civil War enthusiast and to anyone wishing to read for civic enlightenment. ",
            "The second volume of the Library of America\u2019s primary-source history of the Civil War. What\u2019s great about this series is the variety of voices. There are first-hand accounts of battles and political speeches, but also essays and other things from the likes of Herman Melville, Walt Whitman, Louisa May Alcott, Frederick Douglas, and Ralph Waldo Emerson. (19th century American literature is so amazingly rich.) This volume charts 1862, (spoiler alert) the year of the strongest Confederate advance and the Emancipation Proclamation. (If anyone cynically thinks the Emancipation Proclamation was just a pragmatic tool to keep England and France out of the war, read the essays by Douglas and Emerson reacting to it. American freedom in the sense that we know it was born with the Proclamation.) Also documented here is Lincoln's increasing frustration with General Wishy-Washy McClellan. We've all worked with McClellans--otherwise smart and capable people who constantly pull out excuses why things can't be done--and Lincoln barley maintains his Lincoln-esque demeanor in his letters to him. (Not included is when he finally snaps and tells him, I'm paraphrasing, You're telling me your horses are tired? Really? Tired? What the hell have you been doing to make them tired? You haven't been doing shit.) The soldiers' accounts of battles all follow a similar pattern, no matter what the battle or which side they are on. They begin with tactics and some account of how they got to where they are, but then they all just become a catalog of gruesome horrors. The only downside to this series is that with only contemporary and first-hand accounts of the war there can be a sense of too many trees, not enough forest. Some context is provided by very brief introductions to each piece and some endnotes, but without familiarity with the events of the war, it's easy to get lost. I interrupted my reading of the first volume to listen to the Great Courses lecture on the Civil War to get me up to speed. If you don't know the Civil War backwards and forwards, some sort of overview is very helpful to have first.",
            "OMGG...this book was FANTASTIC. Probably the best book I have read on that period of time since Michael Bulingame's Abraham Lincoln: A Life. An absolute must read for anyone who is a Civil War buff. This book reminded me of another book which told of Lincoln from what was being written about him during his presidency, so this book gives the reader insight to what was being written about the war from many fronts AT THE TIME OF THE WAR versus author's perspective or bias. The other thing that I found out in reviewing this book for the publisher is that there are numerous other books written by the same author on the Civil War that I will be going back and reading. I wish I could give it more stars because it deserves it.Two words of caution, like Burlingame's book, this book is long. On my Nook, it was 898 pages and INCREDIBLY detail oriented. It took me 2 months to complete this book. Second, I personally did not like the way it transferred to the ereader. If you are going to read it, invest in a print copy. I have a feeling that would read beautifully!"

            "Three stars for nostalgia! This was a nice bit of escapism. I loved the original Saddle Club books as a child, and was not disappointed by my return to Willow Creek as an adult. The quality of the writing in this book is slightly better than that in the Saddle Club books, but the book still had that Saddle Club feeling. Stevie and Carole and Lisa are still very much themselves, albeit a little older. There's still plenty of horse talk and riding. The Long Ride addresses some fairly serious themes without getting graphic or angsty about any of it, which also feels true to the original series-- I remember those books never shied away from difficult realities, either (Cobalt's death, Lisa's responsible choice to defer horse ownership, Carole's mother being dead, etc.). That being said-- I found the description of Alex and Lisa falling in love comically absurd, and the whole end of the book felt rushed. After all that buildup the fallout from the accident itself should have been a bigger deal. But hey, it's a Saddle Club book, not Dickens, and that's perfectly fine! ",
            "Perfect piece of nostalgia. :)",
            "Growing up, the Saddle Club series was my absolute favorite books. I read (and owned) them all multiple times! I got the Pine Hollows series when I was in my early/mid teens, but only got halfway through this first book before I put it down. In the mood for horse books, I picked this one up again. Seeing Carol, Lisa and Stevie again was like meeting old friends for the first time in a decade and a half. I picked up where I left off with them, and it was refreshing. Despite that, this book only gets 3 stars from me. It might be that I'm honestly too old for this series by this point, but I also enjoy teen books like this for nostalgia quite often... the writing was well, but simple - almost babyish which made it hard for me to focus, get into and enjoy. That is my biggest hangup. It is a book meant for teens who have outgrown the Saddle Club, but the writing doesn't grow with them.",

            "Georges is well-liked by everyone at his school. He helps everyone feel at ease, but he also keeps everyone at a distance due to feelings of guilt about the lives his father has ruined. Then a transfer student named Robert arrives and begins shaking everything up. Robert seems determined to dislike Georges, telling him that he knows his purity and perfection are only a mask and that he's going to rip away. Even so, Georges is determined to befriend him, forcing Robert to confront the things about his own past that Georges reminds him of.I only bought this volume because I found volume 2 in a used bookstore clearance section - I didn't realize at the time that they were the first two volumes of an out-of-print 7-volume series. This could have been tragic if I'd read this first volume and loved it, but (thankfully) it was only so-so. This was melodramatic Catholic schoolboys shouting at each other and having emotions. I'm not sure why the author decided to set things at a Catholic all-boys school rather than just a regular all-boys school. Maybe for extra guilt plus the whole purity thing? From the look of things, it might even be set in an alternate universe - in the afterword, the author wrote The common language spoken in the story world is (supposed to be) Esperanto. My guess is that the author wanted to avoid setting it in a real-world location so as to not have to worry about accuracy as much. This volume was pretty much nonstop drama. First, Georges met Robert, who seemed to view unmasking Georges' negative side as a personal challenge. Then another transfer student, the son of a duke, arrived, and Georges was made his official friend - yet another character determined to provoke Georges into revealing that he isn't as good and kind as he seems. Except he is - his dark side is just guilt over the lives his loan shark (?) father ruined. After that, it was back to Georges and Robert, but digging more into Robert's past, which seemed to involve a girl whose death he may have been responsible for and who Georges apparently resembles.It wasn't boring, but it was a lot. And unfortunately the artwork sometimes made things more confusing than they needed to be. Georges' friend Henri looked an awful lot like Robert - there were a couple times when I thought Georges was walking with Robert when it was actually Henri, and the primary thing that helped me tell the two apart when they shared a scene together was their ties. Henri kept his neat, while Robert's was usually untied.As far as DMP's Yaoi Manga line on the cover goes: If you're looking for steamy BL, you won't find it here. So far there's some tension between Robert and Georges, and Robert kissed him once (which both he and Georges later passed off as nothing). Unfortunately, I tend to prefer sweeter/more romantic BL, and Robert and Georges' interactions have been primarily angry due to whatever baggage Robert is carrying. We'll see if that improves or gets worse in volume 2.Extras:The volume has a removable jacket. The cover underneath includes some extra artwork and a one-page extra comic in which one of Freddy's classmates teases him by pulling his hair up in pigtails while he's napping. There's also an 11-page preview of the next volume (which confusingly includes several panels from volume 1 - why??) and a 2-page afterword by the author that includes four character profiles. Georges' age at the start of the volume was apparently 14 while Robert's was 17, which honestly makes Robert look even more like a bully.(Original review posted on A Library Girl's Familiar Diversions.)",
            "Angsty slow moving shonen-ai. Not a fav. ",
            "Why do I even have this again? Out. It. Goes!",
            "It's listed as yaoi, but there's little of that stuff yet, just mostly character development, though I appreciate that. Instead of it all being about the characters hooking up, we're finding out who they are and getting some hints that their personalities will evolve. Georges, who is probably the intended uke by being shorter and blond, is an innocent but not an idiot. He's angsty at times but thankfully not fragile. Robert is still too much of an asshole and prone to literally yanking Georges around, which I find disappointing and hope doesn't last since the series is aiming on pairing them up. Maybe Georges can change him. This series hasn't been standard yaoi so far, so it's possible. We also have Henri, someone who's looking out for Georges' interests and doesn't like Robert much either so far, though some of that is jealousy, and Sir Freddy, the spoiled noble the dutiful Georges has been assigned to as official friend by the school.But can we declare an end to the plot device as the uke reminding the seme of a lost (and often dead, often somehow by his hand) woman he loved? It's a cop-out that's becoming a cliche. "

            "Premise: sorry for possibile mistakes, I happen to be Italian! Review of the whole series here.I read 1-5 volumes up to now. I didnt use to be a big fan of Shounen-Ai / Yaoi series, but as others have stated, this story is actually about the charachters finding out who they are, which involves that none of them is aware they are not straight at the beginning of the series: they simply discover their feelings for the other person as the story moves on. Its like the love story comes to be the natural consequence of their process of discovery, and not just an excuse to write down cute lovey-dovey scenes between boys. The story is there, and it gives sense to everything. There are mysteries that come to be lightened up to the very end of the series, or as the series moves on, there are people struggling with their feelings and their sense of guilt, there are beautifully constructed sequences, there are well built secondary charachters. I recommend this to anyone who likes good stories that dwelve into people's emotions. I am not very into Shounen-Ai (I already said that?) but when a story is oh-so-good, its Just Good. The charachters being two boys adds even more to the story and its kinda necessary to the plot because of the *spoiler* about Robert's past. So, not the usual Shounen-Ai.UPDATE: I finished the series. Volumes 6-7 were extremely good, actually the best of all: the author became more and more confident, the drawing gets better, but most of all charachter development is fabolous, especially Georges' (but really, all of them). And of of the scenes in the Finale... the one in which Robert's mum is involved... OH THAT SCENE was incredible. Chigusa Kawai was really incredible there.Note: it's a bit funny the fact that the spoilerthat the author had made at the end of the first volume, with the scenes-to-be from the volumes yet to read, is completely changed: it has nothing to do with the way the series actually ends. I think that's because she changed her mind on her way. But that's not a problem, its just a bit funny, and its like having read two versions of the same story (cute ^*).",
            "The mixed story of a boy school in the cathedral.When a new pupil arrives at school, who does not care about stringent rules, affects other pupils, especially as an angelician known to Georges, greatly. The story contains interesting elements, but Manga has been made unclearly and difficult to follow that there is a difficult to follow the lines of origin. The same number of different characters complicateThe understanding of the story too much, and many pieces had to read more times that they realized what is right in it and the characters are right.It may be that the story deepens during the following parts, but at least now I am not reading this series more.",
            "Read all 7 volumes &amp, I was pleasantly surprised by how much I loved this series seeing as I normally don't like reading anything that's heavy on religion. But I loved the story, the art work, &amp, most importantly the characters. They were all funny and had real history behind them. I do wish we had gotten to see more of the side characters (mainly Josh). ",
            "So far this manga is more shonen-ai than yaoi, with a lot of innuendo and no substance to any relationship really. It centers around Georges, a young man who seems as troubled inside as he is happy outside. He has made a pledge to himself that to only way to live with himself is to make others happy even at the cost of his own suffering. So naturally the young man is very popular at his all boy\u2019s high school that we\u2019re to assume is for the wealthy.Enter Robert, who just seems flat out troubled. He takes an instant love-hate relationship with Georges. He refuses to believe anyone can be this good and both wants to rip off the kindly mask Georges wears and yet seems to want to make Georges his.As the story goes on, we learn that Georges odd pledge comes from the fact that his father was a powerful man who destroyed a lot of lives. He\u2019s terrified of being the same as his father. Robert may have been involved with the death of someone. Other character flow in and out of the storyline, including the son of the country\u2019s ruler who resents Georges being assigned to be his \u2018official friend.\u2019 Overall, I wasn\u2019t really grabbed by the storyline. Robert is a little too the alpha male, \u2018you will be mine whether or you want to or not\u2019 type but at least he hasn\u2019t really forced Georges into anything yet which seems to happen all too often in yaoi with that type of character. Robert at least seems to begin to care about Georges. However, it\u2019s not really my sort of story. I picked it up at the Half-price book store since it was a well-known yaoi title and cheap so\u2026 I do have the second volume which I\u2019ll read. I\u2019m not expecting too much but mostly that\u2019s because it\u2019s too contemporary without supernatural elements which is more my thing. My mistake there. ",
            "Review of 1-4One of the first yaoi (boys love) titles I read when I started getting into the genre last year.It starts out with a lot of promise, has a nice atmosphere and the backdrop of having the setting at a Catholic boy's school is fairly nice, compared to many yaoi manga where it just kind of happens in a featureless void that's entirely set up just to get the two main characters together. (ok, so not that bad, but you get the idea.)The characters are fairly well done, even if having one boy being the dark angsty one and the other one cheerful and feminine is beginning to look a little standard. Unfortunately, after volume 2, the plot was going nowhere fast. I liked parts of the character's inner monologues, but the plot (or lack of it) was nonexistent and wanders quite a bit.By volume 4, the mangaka's tendency to draw the character's mouths squished up against the nose in the middle of the face was really bothering me. I know many early volumes of series start off with rough art, but come on- they were really starting to look kind of monstrous and that kinda ruins the whole lovey-dovey vibe for me.If you are a yaoi/shounen-ai fan, you might like this title, but everyone else, stay far, far away."

            "marvelous book mainly on account of following following points1) Incredible insight into much famed and little known Blitzkrieg by master himself2) Unparalleled account of Axis PoV of African campaign. 3) Intricate details of desert warfare4) Most important of all, timely pointers explaining how conduct of war (both strategically and tactically) is changing because of advancement in technology5) An amazing example of how a leader should lead his/ her followers from the front and set up an example for them to follow when going gets tough.Book as I have mentioned above is an extremely well written account of North African campaign in 1941-42. It becomes a little drag towards the end when author shifts his focus to topics of Italian and Invasion battles. But that can possibly be because little Rommel written material for that period was available.A must book for not only people who are interested in WW II, but also a suggested reading for someone who wants to have a deep insight into working of one of the greatest modern time army leader.rating:- ****",

            "THE ROMMEL PAPERS is a definite read for those who have interest in World War II. Rommel, The Desert Fox, was the ultimate military tactician as well as consummate leader of men.Had the powers that be thoughtfully listened to and followed the input of Rommel, it is quite possible that WW II may have ended with a different winner. It\u2019s hard to justify the loss of ground and troops due to constant lack of fuel, food, and sufficient supplies. Germany\u2019s failure in Africa and Normandy was due to the interference of political objectives and a madman versus sound military planning and implementation. Cue the scapegoats when it finally became clear that Germany was losing the war.It is tragic that a Rommel, revered by his troops and officers, was tagged as said scapegoat. Of course, it could never get out that he had continually advised the Reich of tenuous situations that were not addressed. Cowards demanded their pound of flesh. Rommel was presented with a choice: take your own life or don\u2019t and we will take the lives of your family and staff. What a choice to have to make.The input by Manfred Rommel, the 14-yr old son of Erwin &amp, Lu Rommel at the time of the Papers, is especially enlightening and touching.I definitely recommend this book, but know that it is heavy on military tactics used by both Rommel and his opponents on the battlefield."

THe bishop had been trying to understand with his mind Who God is, and the lesson was that our minds can not comprehend God in His fullness, and we must believe what we know.

It actually allows us to see the much wanted interaction between the original and Next Generation Star Trek crews on a level that we never have before. While it is totally absurd, it actually mirors the characters and concepts so well, that it almost reads like a real Star Trek story in some ways. The speach patterns of the characters are perfectly mirrored even though they are saying rediculous things. It deftly points out the differences of the two series and goes for their flaws. It is a humore akin to Mad Magazine and Weird Al Yankovic both in their heyday of the 80s. This does bring up the issue of datedness. It clearly came out around Next Gen's second season. The whole concept of these two crews meeting may be dated to many also, but for old school fans, it is perfect. It catches the Trek-mania of the late eaighties and very early nineties. The story is mostly focused around eighties dieting culture, which is a great source of ridicule. Like pretty much all parodies, it has a tendency to get kind of stupid and drawn out, but it is a very quick read. It also is a kind of fun and humour that should appeal to Hitchhiker's fans, but it is not nearly as dark, mind-breaking, and confusing, or packed with philosohical agenda. I actually didn't know that these books existed until I found them at a thrift store and had to grab them. They deserve more recognition among Trek fans. I am looking forward to book 2. ",
            "This is basically a MAD magazine TOS/TNG spoof in narrative form. It's mostly amusing, but not as great. There are fat jokes that sound like they came from 1983, so it doesn't really work as well. The writer certainly tries to spoof all the TNG (season two!) and TOS characters in their own way. It's a quick read, so it does it's job. Not great, but a Trekkie should crack a smile or two.",

It was Jones, the inventor of Nautilus exercise equipment, who first discovered that short, intense workouts could produce better results than the long, high-volume workouts then in vogue.,Even though research into Jones's methods has proved them correct, a number of high-profile strength coaches use HIT to train their athletes, and the bodybuilding magazine Ironman does HIT-based features every issue, there still are no major HIT books in stores. This new book-by champion bodybuilder, exercise researcher, and best-selling author Ellington Darden, who is a Jones disciple and friend-shows lifters how to apply the master's teachings, along with some new HIT concepts to achieve extraordinary results.,At the heart of the book is a complete, illustrated, six-month course for explosive growth. Exercise by exercise, workout by workout, the reader is shown precisely what to do, and perhaps even more important, what not to do. Charging that too many bodybuilders follow a more-is-better approach-too many exercises, too many sets, and too much frequency-and rely on steroids to compensate for depleted recovery ability, Darden shows why HIT, steroid-free and healthy, is the best way to safely build muscle. Finally, the exercise religion Arthur Jones founded, and Darden fine-tuned, has its bible.",

            "This was my non-fiction book so don't expect much of a story. It is about a man named Arthur Jones who created a training style called high intensity training. He trained a teenager named Casey Viator who would later end up as the youngest Mr. America (Mr. America is a body building competition in America). The author Ellington Darden describes all of the workouts and how they are to be performed in depth and other things such as diet, days off, etc. I believe that this is an amazing training style, but it has its setbacks. 1) You need a trainer that can push you hard enough to do the workouts with high intensity. 2) You need all the equipment it asks for. 3)The Miami Dolphins used this training when they went undefeated in 1972, what I am unsure of is if they used any other workouts to supplement their sports training. If you are offended by body builders with no shirts on then you shouldn't be looking in this book, let alone the cover. I absolutely would recommend this book to people serious about muscle gain.",
            "There is a common more-is-better philosophy that permeates American thought. It spills over from everything including money to bodybuilding. The common popular training approach in bodybuilding is more sets+more reps=bigger muscles. Well anyone who is familiar with High Intensity Training realizes the idea that a muscle only has to be stimulated to maximal effort during one set and allowed to rest in order to grow. As you read the book you'll come into contact with the writing and thoughts of Arthur Jones who was perhaps the first person to start expounding on H.I.T. concepts. This philosophy just makes rational sense and is fascinating to read about. I don't know you'll find anything new in this book but Darden certainly does a nice job of tying everything together and comparing this shorter but harder more intense type of training with the usual longer lower-intensity high volume training. One area I got annoyed with was Darden's implication that very few people can develop BIG muscular growth. He seems to think most all of us are limited by lack of genetic potential to get a really big physique. One of his methods of determining this is to have a subject measure the gap between his flexed bicep and his elbow joint. If you have a 2-inch gap for instance you have very poor genetic potential. This is a bogus method of assessing muscular potential. Obviously the already big guys are going to have less of a gap since their arms are already filled out. If you were to look at Dorian Yates or Markus Ruhl before each of them started training you may have assumed they had little potential as well. However, we know the kind of mass both of these men eventually added to their frames. Anyhow, the rest of the book reads nicely with some bodybuilding history, illustrations of exercises and sample HIT routines to try for the beginner, intermediate or advanced athlete. There's a little discussion on nutrition but not much. At the very end there is a little question and answer section, which is helpful to gaining a better understanding of some of the book's ideas. I recommend it to people who think they know it all...to expand their minds a bit and open up to achieving more of their muscle-building potential. ",

I know it's for men and I'm obviously a woman, but I think a lot of it can be used for my fat loss/muscle gain as well- the numbers are just off. Everything he says is completely contradictory to what everyone else says, but it just rings true- without even trying it, I just feel like it's going to work! If nothing else, it has given me my fire back.",

            "This doorstopper of a novel (about 900 pages) is an excellent 40 year overview of the growth of the US Intelligence structure as seen through the stories of a few men and women who started with the beginnings of the CIA after WWII and grew with the Company to hold positions of leadership. The method of using factual history as the backdrop for many of the plotlines was intrinsic to keeping the interest level high while Littell flipped through the decades. I'd be remiss in not saying that at times (say after 600 pages and still having a third of the book to go), I didn't think hmm, couldn't just wrap it up here, but the continual growth in the direction the company took through the cold war and foreshadowing the beginnings of the fundamentalist ismamic terrorism that is now considered our greatest enemy called for the scope that was presented. One further point - after a brief break, the next book I picked up was a modern political suspense book (First Patient). The banality of this one along with just the poor writing makes me think even higher of Littel's opus. Anyone who enjoys the suspense and spy shelves in the library should definitely treat themselves to The Company.",
            "Robert Littell is no Tom Clancy and I mean that in only the best sense. Littell\u2019s style and subject matter are probably closer to that of John le Carre than to the over-the-top action/adventure novels that Clancy &amp, Company crank out. Just as le Carre\u2019s George Smiley bore little resemblance to fellow Englishmen James Bond, Littell\u2019s Jack McAuliffe bears little similarity to Clancy\u2019s Jack Ryan. Don\u2019t take this as a knock at Clancy, whose books I happen to enjoy. It\u2019s just that like Ian Fleming did with his most famous creation, you can\u2019t really take any of Clancy\u2019s novels as a serious look at what \u2018real\u2019 intelligence agencies are doing.While Littell\u2019s CIA may use their fair share of high tech toys in their efforts to protect the homeland, McAuliffe and his fellow veterans of \u201cCockroach Alley\u201d spend most of their days sitting in dinghy little offices going through the translated radio and phone messages of their counterparts in the Soviet Union. Beginning at the very beginning of what would become known as the Cold War, Jack and his fellow recruits into the newly created Central Intelligence Agency, find themselves in the very center of events that would make headlines and history. From the construction of the Berlin Wall, through the planning of the Bay of Pigs and on to the downfall of the Soviet Union, Littell shows us the inner workings of the CIA.Not only does Littell introduce us to these Americans, he also allows us to see what may have been going on in the opposite camp. Along with Jack, Ebby and Leo (Littell\u2019s Three Musketeers), we also meet Yevegny Tsipin (a second-generation KGB operative) and the mysterious spymaster Starik (the Old Man), both of whom believe that it is their role to bring down the U.S. for the glory of Communism and the Soviet Union. While the CIA sends Jack and the others around the world on various assignments, Yevegny finds himself secreted into the U.S. where he assumes several identities over the years as an undercover agent.Littell shows us two generations of Company employees as they each make their mark on some of the incidents that shaped the later part of the Twentieth Century. We see Jack, Leo and Ebby marry and watch as their sons and daughters each take their turns working to \u2018make America safe from its enemies.\u201d Whether you believe Littell\u2019s version of events is up to you, but he certainly has done an amazing amount of research, leaving the reader to feel that things should have happened this way, even if they didn\u2019t.Along with his own cast of characters, Littell shows us glimpses of such actual American personages as JFK and his brother Robert, William Casey and Allen Dulles. We also get to meet more notorious folks such as Sam Giancana, Kenneth Philby and Vladimir Putin. Whether fictional or factual, Littell brings to all of these characters a sense of reality showing us human beings capable of the vices and virtues we all share. In some cases it doesn\u2019t really matter if the person is real or not, as they all leave an impression and impact on the story. The novels\u2019 800 plus pages explore the Cold War and the personalities who helped shape several generations. Littell doesn\u2019t soft-pedal nor vilify the CIA, as much as he shows us how human beings, usually attempting to do what they thought was right (or at least prudent) to move the political, economic and social events for a \u2018greater purpose.\u2019 Whether or not we believe in that purpose, isn\u2019t important in the end. Littell rightly uses quotes and allusions to Lewis Carrol\u2019s ALICE IN WONDERLAND through out, as the world in which these characters move about truly is something from the far side of the looking glass."

            "\u201cHigh over the city, a rack of clouds drifted across the hunter\u2019s moon\u2026On a deserted avenue near a long wall, a dirty yellow Fiat mini-taxi cut its light and its motor and coasted to the curb at Port Angelica. A lean figure wearing the rough ankle-length cassock and hood of a Dominican friar emerged from the backseat. He had been raised in the toe of the boot of Italy and was known as the Calabrian by the shadowy organizations that from time to time employed his services\u2026\u201d- Robert Littell, The CompanySo opens Robert Littell\u2019s insanely ambitious, 896-page novel about the CIA. In Littell\u2019s precise, hyper-specific way, the date is Thursday, September 28, 1978. The Calabrian is in Rome, and he is making a late-night visit to Pope John Paul I. You know Pope John Paul I, right? He died of a heart attack just 33 days into his papacy. Or so we\u2019re told. In the alternate reality of The Company, the Pope actually fell victim to the Calabrian. Who the Calabrian is, who ordered the hit, and to what end, is a \u201cmystery\u201d that will not be resolved for another 600 or so pages. That does not really matter, though. The Company may begin with this interlude in Rome, but it does not end there. Indeed, the Calabrian and the Pope play a relatively small role in this massive undertaking, which seeks to give us a fictionalized history of the Central Intelligence Agency from the 1950s to the early 1990s. It\u2019s hard to know where to start with a book this big, this entertaining, this problematic. Thus, it helps to start at the beginning, especially since this opening section gives us a good idea of what to expect in the pages to follow. It is shadowy and mysterious and parses out its clues in a restrained and careful manner. It sets up a long-game, at which Littell specializes, one that will eventually pay off but requires some patience beforehand. It is also a seamless and confident melding of historically accepted truth with fringe conspiracies that creates an entirely new reality that feels real, since all the puzzle pieces are suddenly snug, but which is decidedly not. (Conspiracists will love this, because in Littell\u2019s universe, there are no random occurrences, everything is controlled by a man, somewhere, hiding behind a curtain). This kind of conflation is endlessly entertaining, intellectually dangerous (a bit more on that below), and also thematically perfect, as it adds to the \u201cwilderness of mirrors\u201d aura that Littell successfully cultivates. Littell\u2019s novel follows a handful of characters, both American and Russian, as they fight the Cold War in the dark corners and blind alleys of the world. On the American side, we have the fictional Harvey \u201cthe Sorcerer\u201d Torriti, Jack McAuliffe, Leo Kritzky, and Winstrom Ebbitt, as well as the real-life James Jesus Angleton. They are opposed by the Russian agent Yevgeni, who goes under deep cover in America (ala The Americans), and the all-powerful and mysterious Starik, who has a mole deep in the CIA, codenamed SASHA. (Unfortunately, Starik\u2019s most defined trait is his pedophilia, and we are treated to many, many sequences of him and his \u201cnieces\u201d in disgusting situations. This subplot, in which Alice\u2019s Adventures in Wonderland is used as a singularly blunt metaphor for spying, is both gratuitous and unnecessary). In terms of characterizations, the dramatis personae presents a very mixed bag. The best, by a wide margin, is Torriti, a fat, double-chinned alcoholic who is nevertheless eminently suited for his job. His introduction is quite memorable: The Sorcerer was dressed in the shapeless trousers and ankle-length rumpled green overcoat of an East German worker. The tips of a wide and flowery Italian tie were tucked, military style, between two buttons of his shirt. His thin hair was sweat-pasted onto his glistening skull. Eying his apprentice across the room, he began to wonder how Jack would perform in a crunch, he himself had barely made it through a small Midwestern community college and then had clawed his way up through the ranks to finish the war with the fool\u2019s gold oak leaves of a major pinned to the frayed collar of his faded khaki shirt, which left him with a low threshold of tolerance for the Harvard-Princeton-Yale crowd\u2026Nobody in the Company bothered consulting the folks on the firing line when they press-ganged the Ivy League for recruits and came up with jokers like Jack McAuliffe, a Yalie so green behind the ears he\u2019d forgotten to get his ashes hauled when he was sent to debrief Torriti\u2019s hookers the week the Sorcerer came down with the clap\u2026Clutching a bottle of PX whiskey by the throat, closing one eye and squinting through the other, the Sorcerer painstakingly filled the kitchen tumbler to the brim. \u201cNot the same without ice,\u201d he mumbled, belching as he carefully maneuvered his thick lips over the glass. He felt the alcohol scald the back of his throat. \u201cNo ice, no tinkle. No tinkle, schlecht!Frankly, after Torriti, everyone else seems pretty much a cardboard cutout (I'm not using cutout in the espionage sense, either). Jack, the young Yalie who steadily rises up the ranks, is described mainly in terms of his \u201cCossack mustache,\u201d which is referenced enough to make it into a drinking game. He is the stereotypical hero who plays by his own rules. When told not to fall in love with a source, he immediately falls in love with a source. When told not to land on the beaches at the Bay of Pigs, he promptly lands on the beaches at the Bay of Pigs. When asked to explain the Cold War (and the characters, irritatingly, always refer to it as the Cold War, even early in the book, when the phrase probably wouldn\u2019t have been so widespread), Jack says: \u201cIt was about the good guys beating the bad guys.\u201d This is about as boring a sentiment as you can imagine, and leaves one wishing for the moral complexities of Le Carre (who Littell, through his characters, gently mocks). Littell does a fairly decent job with the real-life personages. Most of these are cameos, though some are quite brilliant, if not quite fair. This includes a sexually distracted John Kennedy, impossibly entwined with the Mob, and a clueless, dementia-addled Ronald Reagan, who keeps forgetting his own decisions. (The Company doesn\u2019t really have a political point of view, unless you count its soft anti-democratic leanings. In Littell\u2019s telling, foreign policy is better left to the intelligence men, rather than elected officials, a view at odds with both democracy, and the many failures of the CIA). Littell\u2019s fictionalized Angleton, the famed CIA mole hunter, is extremely well-crafted. Right up until the end, you are not sure whether he was an addled paranoiac, haunted by his onetime friend, the British spy Kim Philby, or whether Angleton was right all along about the extent to which the USSR had penetrated western democracies. (Interestingly, despite being exceedingly pro-CIA, it is the Russians who seem to get the better of the U.S. at every turn. While the American agents keep getting caught, the Russians go free. While American plots fizzle, the Russian plots explode. At the end, you will be almost surprised that the USSR fails, and the U.S. remains). The Company is wildly inconsistent, a testament to how much story it is trying to tell. The early scenes set in Germany, with Torriti and Jack playing their version of the \u201cgreat game,\u201d are superb. In fact, they are the highlight of The Company. Try as it might, the book never recaptures the early magic it found in the noirish dividing line between East and West Berlin. After Berlin, The Company makes big jumps forward in time. There are satisfying set pieces aplenty, including the aforementioned plots to kill Castro, the Bay of Pigs, the Hungarian Revolution, and a surprisingly intense retelling of the attempted coup against Gorbachev by hard-line Communists in 1991. The temporal leaps are necessary, in order to get to all these momentous events. The downside, though, is that you lose the carefully modulated tension Littell meticulously builds. In a way, The Company is a series of rising and falling arcs. Once one arc is finished, Littell moves on and starts all over again. This can be a bit frustrating, and more than once, I found myself wishing that he had chosen one storyline and stuck with it. Of course, that would defeat Littell\u2019s Mailer-like attempt to swallow and digest the whole of the CIA.Another downside to Littell\u2019s ambition is that his initial characters, the ones that we become most familiar with, even if they are a bit flat (e.g., Jack), cannot remain in the same place. As time moves on, they get old, and they have to be replaced. The biggest loss is Torriti, who disappears for most of the novel, only turning up now and then. In rather simplistic fashion, Littell replaces an aging Jack and an aging Ebbitt with Jack\u2019s son, Anthony, and Ebbitt\u2019s son, Manny. It\u2019s saying something that Anthony and Manny are even less developed than their fathers. Littell is at ease with the spycraft. He is awkward to the point of being cringe-worthy when he attempts to flesh out the personal lives of his characters. When two men are talking about spying, the dialogue sings, especially at Littell ladles out the lingo, using great phrases such as \u201cbarium meals\u201d and \u201cwalking back the cat\u201d to describe the process of flushing out a rat. But when a man attempts to talk to a woman\u2026Well, it\u2019s not good. You might ask, at this point: What about the women? Well, for the most part, women need not apply. Littell has a weird habit of introducing a potentially-interesting female character, one who is dynamic, capable, driven, and then forcing her on a short, dull journey to the middle. The main role for any woman in The Company is as a wet-blanket hausfrau, relegated to nagging her man about his devotion to the job, only to be put in her place by her man\u2019s patriotic blandishments. In terms of writing, Littell is no Le Carre. He is not a prose stylist or deep philosophical thinker. Rather, he is a plotter. The genius of The Company is how it takes the paranoia of Angleton and allows it to infuse every page. You do not know who is who or what is what. Is this character loyal or a turncoat? Is that a defector or a dispatched agent? Every single occurrence might be a genuine event, or it might be a ploy, or it might be a genuine event that is a ploy to make you think the genuine event is not genuine. The plot is an Escherian staircase, it expands and contracts, folds and unfolds, loops back on itself. There is a long con at play, interrupted by a series of shorter ones. At times, Littell loses the thread himself, and has to resort to the Mossad to cut the Gordian know (deus ex Israeli). For the most part, though, things pay off quite satisfyingly. At the start, I mentioned the blending of history with fiction. This is worth mentioning because Littell's third-person narrative is entirely self-assured. He describes made-up events with the same authority as he does the historical elements. He takes fragments, such as Kennedy\u2019s alleged mob connections, and uses them to build impressive edifices. In many respects, this really is an alt-history of the Cold War, with the conspiracy theory given prevalence at almost every turn. It\u2019s important to remind yourself: this is a novel. But what a novel! Strange as it sounds, the prodigious length of The Company actually helps dilute its many shortcomings. And Littell\u2019s insistence on keeping things moving forward, ever forward, never allows you time to consider quitting. That\u2019s saying something, too. That over the course of 900 pages, despite some terrible sex scenes, grating dialogue, and limp characters, I was always anxious to find out what happened next, even though, for the most part, because this is historical fiction, I already did.",
            "Back when I was in middle school, I would have given my left nut to be James Bond (as portrayed by Sean Connery, not Roger Moore). I read all the books (they were a link from reading comics to reading actual books without pictures) and watched all the movies about a half dozen times each. The lure of being a super spy was great. I even remember reading that the CIA used to show James Bond films as part of their training.The CIA\u2019s version of Bond, as rendered here (code name: Sorcerer), was an overweight alcoholic who played opera full blast in his office just in case the Commies were trying to listen in on his conversations, so any illusions I might still have about Bondian spycraft (drinking martinis, shagging supermodel villainesses, driving sports cars, fighting lethal hat throwing henchman) have now officially evaporated.This James Michner-like tome charts the history of the CIA from their early days in Berlin up until the Gorbachev-Yeltsin years. The CIA went from a unit who did intelligence gathering and counter-intelligence to covertly trying to topple regimes.The book can be a load at times, but some of the early set pieces work well, specifically the ones dedicated to the Hungarian\u2019s attempted overthrow of Communism in 1956 and the CIA\u2019s covert overt Bay of Pigs debacle in 1961. If true, the way they tried to kill Castro is laughable.* Beyond that featured point in Agency history, this colossus of a book has a tendency to get repetitive - CIA agent in danger/captured, let\u2019s get him out. Didn\u2019t this happen 250 pages ago? Why yes, Jeff, yes it did.Littell populates his tale with historical figures and gamely tries to bring the past to life (\u201cSo Joe, how was Young Frankenstein?\u201d Or \u201cThey made love while listening to new pop music sensation Madonna singing her current hit, \u201cLike a Virgin\u201d\u201d). Yeesh! JFK and his brother Bobby (hubris) and especially Ronald Reagan (doddering) come off poorly, as rendered here. The character that livens up the book each and every time he appears is the above mentioned Sorcerer. The fat man has moxie.If you like spy novels or historical fiction, I would say give it a go.*Bayer aspirin dosed with quick killing bacteria.",

A little bit intimidating, I'm not going to lie. At close to 1300 pages and spanning the period from 1950 until the mid-90s, it was one tackled in bite-sized chunks over about four months. I really enjoyed it and more than once found myself applying the brakes to stick to my reading plan of 11 pages a day.CIA recruitment, post-War Berlin operations, Albanian nationalists, Hungarian uprising, deep-set Soviet infiltrators, Bay of Pigs, Cuba, Kennedy, Krushchev, a papal assassination, KGB, Berlin Wall, Reagan, Gorbachev, reform, reaction, espionage, counter-espionage, inter-agency rivalries, interrogation, torture, capture, Afghanistan, family, friendship loyalty, trust, betrayal and about a gazillion other things.It's an ambitious book and one I really enjoyed. I did find myself thinking about the author's depiction of events and found myself wondering if he had the fast track to inside information or a fertile imagination. For example the death of the first Pope John Paul after about a month in office - heart attack, natural causes or as Littell would have us believe a hit to prevent an investigation into the Vatican Bank laundering money for a foreign agency. Interesting, enjoyable, topical. I enjoyed the way the author used family and subsequent generations to provide some continuity in the depiction of events unfolding over decades. I do like espionage books. I like characters brimming with secrets and duplicity, where you present one face to the world while your real intentions are concealed.4.5 from 5This was my first outing with Robert Littell, but definitely not my last. At least his other books on the TBR pile are all a bit shorter.

            "One of the great cold-war, spy novel epics. Belongs on the shelf next to le Carr\u00e9's Karla Trilogy: Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy / The Honourable Schoolboy / Smiley's People and Mailer's Harlot's Ghost.",
            "Littell provides an in-depth and captivating look at the history of the CIA. The Company incited captivating discussions in my household, and has fostered in me a new found interest in the history behind the turmoil in the Middle East. Littell is a masterful story teller and this espionage thriller is without equal. "

            "Time for some Hard Core Adventuring24 December 2012tYou are a great adventurer and happen to be in a city when rumours of an army advancing from the east reach your ears. Since the city's own army (not that it will do any good in this situation) is elsewhere, you and a bunch of other adventurers are all called together to help. You are then given three choices, stay behind and defend the city (bad choice as you quickly become a corpse), head north to bring back the army (bad choice because you miss out on some important items), or head east to scout out the army (the good choice, but if you head north you end up having to go east anyway, and since you are given necessary items by going east, you might as well do this - anyway, you are the hard core adventurer so you might as well do the hard core stuff).tThis adventure has brought the gamebooks back up a notch, since while it is not easy, you at least have a chance of making it through and not getting lost in a myriad of mazes. It is also easier to work out the correct choices (such as doing the hard core thing of going east) rather than having to constantly guess. There is a maze in this book, but fortunately it is only small, and it doesn't drain any of your time.tOh, yes, there is that thing about time. You only have a certain amount of time in which to complete the adventure. Fortunately I finished it with bucket loads of time left so I don't know what happens if you run out, or get close to running out, though I must say that I probably missed a couple of things by trying to save time. Yes, I do cheat, but that is because I am trying to review these books and working out which ones I would like to waste a lot more time on (though some of the badder ones I would probably like to go through again with pencil and dice, as well as some form of strange map, if it is possible to make one with some of these books).tI guess if I were to give you some hints, I will suggest that you need to locate the reaver's bottle, and also the wound that changes colour (those are the two that I didn't find as I explored this book, but I stumbled across the other things). Some have suggested that it is 'guess the right item' to be able to pass something a few paragraphs on, but I didn't find it like that, but at least it is not like Crypt of the Sorcerer in which you have to collect tonnes of items and hope you haven't missed any when you get to the end. Oh, and the time is only relevant for a part of the book, and I managed to get through the time part with plenty of left, so I didn't need to worry about hurrying all that much.",

Using translation as his lens, David Bellos shows how much we can learn about ourselves by exploring the ways we use translation, from the historical roots of written language to the stylistic choices of Ingmar Bergman, from the United Nations General Assembly to the significance of James Cameron's Avatar.Is That a Fish in Your Ear? ranges across human experience to describe why translation sits deep within us all, and why we need it in so many situations, from the spread of religion to our appreciation of literature; indeed, Bellos claims that all writers are by definition translators. Written with joie de vivre, reveling both in misunderstanding and communication, littered with wonderful asides, it promises any reader new eyes through which to understand the world. In the words of Bellos: \"The practice of translation rests on two presuppositions. The first is that we are all different: we speak different tongues, and see the world in ways that are deeply influenced by the particular features of the tongue that we speak. The second is that we are all the same\u2014that we can share the same broad and narrow kinds of feelings, information, understandings, and so forth. Without both of these suppositions, translation could not exist. Nor could anything we would like to call social life. Translation is another name for the human condition.\"",

            "This review sums up my problem with this book. For what it is, it's a well-written, informative and interesting book about the art of translation, its difficulties and the assumptions you have to make to translate. It reminded me of my experience in trying to translate Wulf and Eadwacer. To translate it, you have to decide what it means, to ensure that you translate it consistently. And there's four or five different readings of it, at least -- and ultimately I was left with the feeling that to translate it with any one of those meanings would be to translate it wrongly. I think the beauty of reading it in Anglo-Saxon, even if you need a glossary and ample help, is that all the meanings are there at once.But as the review I linked says, it doesn't talk about the implications of translation -- the politics and force of it. That in its turn reminds me of a scene in Kate Roberts' Feet in Chains, a Welsh book (which, not coincidentally, I was only able to read in translation), in which a mother is informed of the death of her son in WWI via a letter in English, which she cannot understand. There was a time, really not that long ago, where Welsh speakers were considered uneducated because they did not speak the language of their rulers, the English. Consider the Welsh Not or Brad y Llyfrau Gleision (The Treason of the Blue Books) -- all of that is the reason that I, raised by two Welsh people, of a family that has been Welsh for generations (with the occasional addition of Romani and Irish blood, and probably some English, but we're ashamed of that one), do not speak my own language.There's a certain arrogance to English. Take the Welsh word hiraeth: there is no English translation. The minute I say that, half a dozen English people pop up to tell me there must be. Oh, there are approximations, but they aren't as succinct, as specific. English doesn't hold all the answers.Unfortunately, this book is that bit Anglo-centric, and it isn't the book I wanted to read -- I wanted to read a book which considered the above issues, the political meaning and applications of translation. It's not a bad book for what it is, but it's not what I was looking for."

            "David Bellos, famous for translating Life: A User\u2019s Manual and his compendious Georges Perec bio, writes a comprehensive, semi-scholarly and semi-accessible book exploring translation in its multifarious forms. Covering the complexities of literary translation\u2014from verbatim likenesses to humour to style\u2014into wider world areas such as legal and political translation (less captivating material for laymen), Bellos is a witty and super-smart writer who makes a convincing case for the importance of translation and its unsung participants. For those among you (that means Manny) still convinced a literary work loses too much in translation to bother reading\u2014if this marvellous book doesn\u2019t persuade you, nothing will. Last word from David: \u201cA translation can\u2019t be right or wrong in the manner of a school quiz or a bank statement. A translation is more like a portrait in oils. The artist may add a pearl earring, give an extra flush to the cheek or miss out the grey hairs in the sideburns\u2014and still give us a good likeness. It\u2019s hard to say just what it is that allows viewers to agree a portrait captures the important things\u2014the overall shape as that special look in the eye. The mysterious abilities we have for recognizing good matches in the visual sphere lie near to what it takes to judge that a translation is good. But the users of a translation, unlike the friends of the portraitist\u2019s sitter, don\u2019t have full access to the model (they would barely need the translation if they did). That\u2019s probably why translation raises such passionate responses. There\u2019s no choice but to trust the translator. When it comes to speech and writing, people are an untrusting lot.\u201d (p331)",
            "From the title, I expected this to be friendlier, to be a good introduction to issues of translation. Instead, I found much of it to be nearly impenetrable nitpicking, and much of the rest to be obvious to any student of human nature, any auto-didact of modern psychology. I wanted examples, anecdotes, something a bit like They Have a Word for It: A Lighthearted Lexicon of Untranslatable Words &amp, Phrases promises to be.*Book-darts:Author is guilty of saying Chinese language in every context, instead of acknowledging that there are actually many Chinese languages... the least he could have done is say Standard Chinese.There is a somewhat interesting bit about films &amp, subtitles &amp, voice-overs. For example, Meryl Streep's German voice is that of Dagmar Dempe, for *all* her films.The chapter about Language Parity in the European Union includes interesting bits**I liked learning how Google Translate does (did? the book is several years old) its thing. It looks through established translated documents for the the given text, often finding a pivot language between the two. Popular fiction, for example John Grisham, Harry Potter, is a good source of say, English-&gt,Farsi and English-&gt,Icelandic... giving a user the possibility of finding a match for Farsi-&gt,Icelandic. We all know it doesn't yet work wonderfully, but as of Bellos' writing it is the best available machine translation, at least in his opinion.Good clue to whether a person is reciting a prepared lie or speaking extemporaneously - are they gesticulating? Most ppl can't help but use their hands to help their brain organize their thoughts and come up with words. Bellos gives interesting evidence.I also noticed a distinct absence of So. African, Canadian &amp, Australian mentions. I forgot to mark it, but to paraphrase from memory: If you want your kid to be a highly sought-after and well-compensated translator for the UN or EU, eg, don't raise him in Britain or the US.  Of course Bellos *meant* to say don't raise him with English as his L1.I dunno. Others may certainly get more out of the book than I. Probably not readers who already have studied translation, or readers who struggle with the writing of academics, but surely there's somebody who actually would enjoy, and learn from, this.I'm going to try Through the Language Glass: Why the World Looks Different in Other Languages next.*Howard Rheingold's book was also a disappointment.** I use the word 'bit' because Bellos doesn't explore ideas fully... he starts them out and then either digresses or truncates....",
            "This book ended up on several Best Books of 2011 lists, yet I wonder if every reviewer read past the sexy title and consumed it from end to end. David Bellos is a professional translater (French to English) and has some very interesting and enlightening views on communication and translation. In this book, he doesn't shy away from radical overstatement (such as when he says that nowadays English is the only lingua franca that the various Belgian linguistic communities can still use to communicate with each other). But he is easily forgiven, because he really provides new insight on what a translation is or should be. Unavoidably, this leads to meta-meta-paragraphs about language which can be quite dense at first glance. Other parts are seriously theoretical (such as the Axiom of Ineffability), which make this book's position on the Best Books list rather surprising, as I doubt that many people are interested in this level of theoretical analysis (I am, so I enjoyed it).",
            "There are a lot of things I liked about David Bellos\u2019s \u201cIs That a Fish in Your Ear? Translation and the Meaning of Everything\u201d. He succeeded in reminding me of what I have always found so fascinating in the art of translation and been amazed by while studying applied linguistics and anthropological linguistics, learning various languages, living in seven countries around the world and (mis)communicating with others. Namely, this realisation that translation is what we all do all the time, through various means: language, gestures, facial expressions, and what betrays some of our identities. This book is as much about cultures, identities, philosophy, values and societies as it is about, among other issues, simultaneous interpreting, translation of poetry, other literary texts and jokes, translation in business and law, the importance of contextualisation, and the traps of, e.g. thinking that native speakers know their own language better than those for whom it is not a mother tongue. I liked the global approach (with, however, most space devoted to English and French) with which Bellos tackled the subjects. Translation is, and has always been, the core of our cultures and our existence, and therefore I believe \u201cIs That a Fish in Your Ear?\u201d is a book for everyone who is at least slightly interested in the history of humanity and human communication.

            "*** 4.25 ***A buddy read with the love of my life @ the MacHalo Freaks!!! Elise, what are you doing, girl??? Could you do any more damage to yourself and the people around you with the complete disregard for danger, which seems to be attracted to you like a magnet?!?!? Do you realize you are breakable and mortal, and those around you even more so? How do you have the courage to face enumerable, much more powerful enemies with only a sword and a prayer??? Of course things are not going to be going well when the biggest, baddest, most powerful ancient demons have decided to do away with the world and to do so, they have to go through you! Well, more like the portal to Heaven which you are supposed to be protecting and prevent any demon from crossing.. And girl, how are you going to be able to save the world if you and your bonded male witch James are having a tiff and you are not texting him back... Yeah, he has been a douchebag lately, hooking up with that bitch Stephanie while completely ignoring your feelings, but he is bonded to you with the soul purpose of kicking some demon ass!!! You have to work it out...And why are you stringing this poor Anthony boy along? He is not made for the stress and anxiety the real you brings to the equation. The dude needs a good, normal girl who is going to adore him and let him take care of her... Elise, you can kick his ass and smush him with a look, let him go...Also, what is it about James? He is soooooo not a good dude! He is also a terrible boyfriend (the way he ignores Stephanie is abominable!), and is not a very good with backing your ass up with his magic either. Half the time you end up having to save his skin anyway, what is it with the secret desire for him??? Let it go, girl, let it go!I also strongly recommend that you take a page in the daily Post and worn everyone that just knowing you is not only bad for their health, but most likely will shorten their lifespan very significantly... And forget about volunteering to help Elise in any way!!! The bodies will never be found...So, overall, this was one terrifying, dynamic, nail-biting ride through the destruction of an American city and possibly the beginning of the end of the world. And our girl was right in the middle of the action, of course. And it was frustrating, scary and addictive all at once! So, thank you, Elise, for taking me to the brink of a nervous breakdown and keeping me at a level of adrenaline overdose all the way to the end and beyond!!! I wish you all Happy Reading and may we all be able to eventually relax with a nice, normal book:-)",
            "Everything that happened in this book is a direct consequence of the events in the previous books as well as the actions the characters took or chose not to takes. In that sense, this book feels like the end of a cycle. It wraps up a story arc and a character arc for Elise. Elise's problem has always been her inability to connect with her own emotions, share emotional moments with others, or even to recognize emotions in others. In this book we learn more about her upbringing, and frankly, I'm not surprised that she is so broken and emotionally shunted. I think she is a borderline psychopath. So when she is confronted with deep emotional traumas, like being rejected by James (in flashbacks) or Betty's death, she doesn't the only thing she knows to do - she runs away from those emotions. She doesn't want to confront them. Which creates a rift between her and the few people who are close to her, like James and Anthony, and that rift has been steadily growing in the past books to become an almost uncrossable chasm. It's kinda telling that Elise fells closer to the demons who work at the casino, than she does to her fellow humans. It's sad to see that this rift had been growing between Elise and her aspis almost since the night they performed the binding ritual, since they never addressed the elephant in the room which is Elise's attraction to him. And by then beginning of this book, the relationship between Elise and Anthony can only be called as toxic and unhealthy for both of them. Again, because of their inability to discuss Betty's death and what it is doing to them. It's like Betty was the glue that held those two together, and now that she is gone, everything is unraveling. All Elise has left is her resolve to keep the gates to the garden closed and her pain, so no wonder the book ended how it did... Or did it? That epilogue threw me for a spin. Now I want to see what this is all about.",

And The Descent series is fast becoming part of my top 10. SM Reine thank you. Your mind has spun this magical world, a world I\u2019m now lost in. Lost but loving it!"

            "There's no point to repeating what StM has written in her excellent review, so I'm just going to note a few irritants I wasn't expecting in this book:1. The heroine is a tantrum-throwing machine. I expected the emotionally vacant hero's monstrous selfishness, but where I would usually sympathize with the heroine in these situations, I couldn't because she came across as emotionally unbalanced. There's a flashback to the devastating scene that precipitated their break, in which the heroine, convinced her husband has been out late with the OW, greets him with claws and fists and screeches, then -- after he freezes her out and says he will no longer tolerate her childish tantrums -- she goes crawling to him, begging him to forgive her and attempting to seduce him. Emotional whiplash. In an early scene, when she thinks this monster may have followed through on his threat to take her child away from her if she doesn't cooperate with his plan to convince the duchy that their marriage is strong, she races to the nursery in emotional distress and has hysterics over the toddler. Honestly, her demonstrated lack of self-control scared me, and it continued through the penultimate scene in the book, when she fabricates an assignation between her husband and the OW and throws a glass of wine in his face before fainting. 2. After that scene, the OW calls the duke to express her concern that seeing her may have distressed his wife. I hate OW intervention to begin with, but it's made worse when the husband stands up for the OW, telling his wife that she was concerned and she's really not the enemy you seem to think she is. Stop telling your wife her feelings are invalid, douchebag. (Seriously, was this book written by Camilla Parker Bowles? What the heck?)3. The relationship with the OW, for which our narcissist never expresses remorse, is outright emotional infidelity. He had tried at least a thousand times to make Sofia understand what that relationship meant to him--for it was a relationship he had no intention of putting an end to just because it stirred a bit of palace gossip. (chapter 4)Fiona and I were lovers once, but that all ended four years ago. It ended the day I became engaged to you. I don't deny that, over the years, I've continued to see her from time to time. But not as a lover. As a friend. As a confidante. (chapter 9)There's just so much in these two quotes to unpack. His complete lack of consideration for his wife in the first. This isn't about palace gossip, jerkwad, it's about her feelings and your prioritizing another woman above your marriage. And ended the day I became engaged to you in the second? I cannot erase from my mind the idea of him having sex with the OW the night before he proposed to the 19-year-old virgin. He. Is. Awful.And in case you were in any doubt whether this supposedly platonic friendship encroached on his marital relationship: after the duke reveals the OW is leaving him for some Frenchman and the heroine asks if he'll miss her, he replies, I won't miss her at all. I have no reason to miss her any more. ... I have you, and the more I get to know you, the more I realise you're all I'll ever need.So, yeah, his confidante was filling an emotional role he has now graciously decided his wife can handle. I may have just gagged a little.",
            "What a waste of my time.And I can\u2019t even say that I wasn\u2019t warned\u2026This was bad, all bad.Shallow way to deal with issues.Several inconsistencies.One of the worst couple of characters of all the times.The hero marries the heroine because she was a suitable bride material, he kept seeing his mistress after the wedding.Where did I hear a similar story? \u2026 Ahem\u2026 cough cough\u2026In the beginning all seems to be ok, their second life if wonderful but as soon as she\u2019s pregnant he doesn\u2019t seem to be so eager for sex.Then there are rumors of him seeing his (ex?) mistress again.He never denies or explains.She\u2019s an awful heroine, who shouts and throws tantrum each time she sees ow, even if they don\u2019t do anything more that speak in public.Then they quarrel again and again and eventually he tells her it\u2019s better if they lead separate lives.But after some months he asks her to play happy couple in public and to have another child.When she refuses he threatens to keep their child from her.She accepts reluctantly, and then suddenly he\u2019s all sweet and seductive and he wants their marriage to work.Ow is always on the side though and until the end there\u2019s this thing- her shouting and accusing, him never explaining and threatening with their child- and I really wanted to take their heads and bang them into one another\u2019s- maybe one of them would have turned out saner.The book was a mess.Some things are never explained, here\u2019s the list:The threats he made about their child were awful and abominable: he never apologized for them.He didn\u2019t love her in the beginning, he loved her after he understood she was more mature, from a couple of hours their spent together. Really???They had wonderful sex in the beginning but after she got pregnant he became cold and then after their child was born there was not sex at all. Why?He only was interested in sex when he asked her to have another child. Isn\u2019t it romantic?Ow was only his friend. Yeah right.And anyway, even if she were, his first duty was for his wife and since he insisted very much on what his duty was, he should have understood that his relationship with ow was ruining his marriage and he should have ended it.But obviously this didn\u2019t matter to him at all.The heroine was a poor demented woman, obsessed with jealousy and ready to misunderstand all she saw or heard. And she forgave him all kind of cruelty. She should have gone to the press and have denounced his abuses. See if he could keep the child from her. I don\u2019t think so.Anyway this is one of the worst heroes I\u2019ve found in romance and the HEA was unbelievable and messed too.I didn\u2019t feel any love from him, it was all about him and him alone.He used emotional blackmail of the worst kind: to take a child away from his mother.I think this is not forgivable and the man is not redeemable.I don\u2019t think I can save anything at all if this book.",
            "This was a how bad could it be book. I'm not committed to 2 \u2b50 I didn't hate it, she's immature and he's an ass particularly as he uses their child as a way to control her."

            "OMG. This one was infuriating. Oink. Oink. Pig alert! Skillets at the ready! Hero married the 19 year-old heroine at the urging of his advisers. He needed a virgin baby-making machine to perk up the kingdom after his father died. The heroine was in love with the hero, the sex was great, but then she kept hearing rumors about her husband and an OW.Hero tells her nothing is going on, but he and the OW are still friends and he enjoys her company so the heroine can just put up with it. !!!!!!!!!!!!Heroine is not happy, but then gets pregnant and is in a baby haze for awhile. The hero moved out of the royal bedroom after one too many fights. They have been leading separate lives for five months. When the story opens the hero tells the heroine they must be seen in public together to thwart all the rumors about the OW. Heroine is not inclined to cooperate until the hero threatens to keep her son away from her. Let that sink in. He repeatedly - throughout the story - even after they are sleeping together - threatens to keep her 16 month old son away from her. I didn't blame her - in a moment of desperation - for trying to take her son on her own to her parents. But the hero catches her because she is being watched. From then on she can only see her son with a third party present.Nice guy - our hero.It all comes to a head when the heroine faints from her second pregnancy while she sees the OW at the same restaurant as the hero. He explains that the OW is moving away and he won't be seeing her again. Oh, and by the way, he now he realizes what a great gal the heroine is. He's glad she's been so patient with him and now he's in love.Okay - pull the other leg. Since the heroine is all of 23 by now, and has been drinking the Kool-aid - I guess I can't blame her for believing his avowals of love. I, old crone that I am, have been reading romances forever, and I didn't believe a word that came out of his worthless mouth. He enjoyed having sex with a nubile teenager, and he enjoyed his relationships with the OW and wouldn't give it up. He was emotionally cheating his entire marriage. And he underscored that by publicly talking to this chick while his wife was present. He was beyond disrespectful. The heroine catch pitch as many tantrums as she likes in my book.",

            "This is an older Sweet Cherish book I picked up because I love a marriage in trouble trope. This is the third in a series about a Royal family in a small Dukedom somewhere in Europe. Sofia was the arranged bride for the Duke. Damiano had to take the throne after the sudden death of his father and it was important he marry and produce an heir. Sofia was a friend of his sister's and he'd known her for years so when she was put forward as his wife, he thought it would be a good match even without love.Unfortunately Sofia is madly in love with Damiano and his good manners didn't allow her to see until too late that he had no feeling for her except as a dutiful wife and the mother of his heirs. Even before the birth of Allessandro, their son, trouble reared it's ugly head. Rumour had it that Damiano was consorting with his former mistress and while he dismissed Sofia's accusations at the time, he made no attempt to change his behaviour so it was only a matter of time before they became estranged.This is where the story begins. The estrangement between the Duke and his wife has become a matter of concern to the people and Damiano has decided that it's time for Sofia to shape up and put the rumours to rest. This is where things get ugly. Obsessed with forcing Sofia to do her duty, he does a number of things that are cruel and only succeeds in driving her further away. Especially as he still has not done anything about clearing the air about his former mistress.This got to be quite an emotional read at times. Sofia might have been young and hysterical and acted immaturely at times, but she was absolutely correct that he didn't love her when they married so I can understand why she felt so betrayed and out of control.Damiano takes a while to redeem himself. But this is a romance so we get the obligatory happy ever after. There is an epilogue which ties up all three stories nicely. It didn't bother me that I hadn't read the other two.",
            "Everyone was right. I want to bitch and rant but my blood pressure\u2026all I gotta say is, I wish doormats would stop writing romance novels.What\u2019s it about: She loved him always, he loved someone else + they marry moc + H Cheater + doormat wife + blackmails doormat + doormat with uncontrollable body part + more cheating + doormat forgives all after 1 sentence numerous times! Lots of misunderstanding.",
            "He doesn't cheat but he is selfish, arrogant and emotionally abusive until he realises her worth.She believes he is cheating with an ex mistress and there is a good reasoning behind it but rather than explain properly he allows her to believe it even though it hurts her deeply.He uses their child to blackmail her.I would have liked more redemption if he is going to be so awful."

It reads like a series of articles from the business section interspersed by ill-fitting, irrelevant domestic scenes in an attempt to justify it being a bound volume. It seems perpetually removed from its subject, not satisfying the personal-portrait desires by biography buffs, while also spending too much time on meaningless financial trivia, disappointing interested investors looking for deeper insight into one of the most successful investing world views in history. ",
            "Sadly, a poorly written book about an interesting person. One can derive similar lessons and insights with greater ease and clarity - and with less of the random useless biographical minutiae - from The Snowball, Poor Charlie's Almanac and the Peter Bevelin books.",
            "Charlie Munger's is a story that needs to be told. And told well. Unfortunately this effort is a poor one. Badly written, needlessly detailed on unimportant aspects, and badly organised.And yet, useful in pockets.",
            "Ch 20 bmark",
            "There are multiple books and papers written about the vice Chairman of Berkshire Hathaway, Charles T. Munger. When Damn Right! was published however there wasn\u2019t much. And whereas a lot is written about Munger as an investor, in this biography we get to know him on a more personal level from his birth to his 70s around the year 2000. Munger and his family always wanted to remain out of the public eye, causing very little information to be available about Munger before Damn Right!. Thus, Munger\u2019s family was not overly excited about this book from the start. Still, the author Janet Lowe told Munger that she was going to write about him with or without his consent and after a while he agreed to be cooperative. Lowe is an investment writer and author. She specializes in books about business leaders and has among others portrayed Benjamin Graham, Warren Buffett and Bill Gates.Damn Right! describes how Munger was born in 1924 and grew up in Omaha. His family taught him the sound morals of Thomas Jefferson and Benjamin Franklin from an early age. His father was an Omaha judge and Munger followed in his father's footsteps by pursuing law. Early in his career he suffered from both distractive events as being forced into military service, as well as sad ones with a divorce and the tragic death of his son. It took him until his thirties to start accumulating his fortune which he built out of savings from his legal practice, invested into real estate projects. Having realized that debt is a vital ingredient to be successful in real estate investing together with it being a full-time job, he soon moved on to other interests. This involved starting an investment partnership and resigning from being a lawyer after having co-founded the law firm Munger, Tolles and Olsen - which is used by Berkshire to this day.Munger ran a concentrated investment portfolio with huge success but also wild fluctuations. He frequently discussed his investment ideas with Warren Buffett who he later famously went into business with, taking the subordinate position as vice Chairman of Berkshire Hathaway. Munger is famously known for teaching Buffett that it pays off to pay up for quality. What is not so known but explained in the book is that he himself also learnt that lesson fairly late. The company that in this regard made the strongest impression on him and Buffett was See\u2019s Candies, a high quality, premium chocolate company located in San Francisco which has been a home run for Berkshire.Aside from getting to know some of his and Berkshire's investments in See\u2019s Candies, The Buffalo Evening News and Salomon Brothers the reader is introduced to Munger\u2019s moral compass, which is strongly influenced by Franklin - his biggest hero. Munger is of the view that honesty and hard work will take a person a long way. Morals aside, a trait he is famous for which isn\u2019t as positive though, is his manners. People who don\u2019t know him well may think he is arrogant and rude. One thing that defines Munger is that he didn\u2019t set out to become superrich but rather financially independent enough to pursue interests within education, medicine and philanthropy and also his hobbies of architecture, travelling and fishing.Although the book is filled with timeless quotes from both Munger and Buffett I still feel that some quotes are a bit misplaced where one subject is discussed and then followed by a quote or writing which is not really connected with the prior text disrupting the flow of the reading. However, this is more of a minor observation than a large negative. For me, a book about Munger could never be boring. I like Poor Charlie\u2019s Almanack more, which is a book I often go back to, but I still rate Damn Right! highly and it\u2019s a must for all Buffett &amp, Munger fans. The part I enjoyed the most was to get more insight into Charlie Munger the person and not only his sharp quotes and wisdom, even if the book gives the reader plenty of that too.The only thing I would ask for now is for someone to fill in the gaps of the last 20 years of the fascinating life of Charlie Munger.

            "Damn Right! Is the story of Charles Munger and the Munger family, Charles Munger is the decades long partner of Warren Buffett. He is a business man, lawyer, real estate developer, and some will say a philosopher. It is not a story of get rich fast, or a story of a young guy with a brilliant idea that changed the world in 5 years or less. It is a different kind of a story, a story of hard work, a story of tragedies and triumphs, a story of building your life dreams one day at a time, a story of a man with gumption. Some criticize the book of not detailing the investment philosophy of Charles Munger, some say it has too many details or too few of them. I think it is not an investment book per se, but it is a mind set book. I find it to be a fascinating story of a man with values that we all know, determination that we aspire to have, and yes some luck that we wish for. I once spoke with two business owners, they both had the same type of business, they both had partners, both were determined and hard working and they both struggled, one of them became a very successful multi branch business while the other bankrupt. Why? I think that by reading the book you might find the answer, and if not you might get inspired. When the situation is tough and one craves to raise the white flag, there will be the ones who will give up and ones that will keep on pushing. Charles Munger story is of a person that kept on going for decades and achieved the success he deserved.",

            "Death and the Maidens had a surprisingly good story. Unfortunately, as highly touted as the artist is, Klaus Janson, his comic's legend artwork didn't really do it. Sad because this story could have used some better art. Seriously in one scene, Nyssa visits Bruce at Wayne Manor and she's sitting down, as Bruce approaches her and the art is so weird that the perspective makes Bruce look like a dwarf monkey of some sort. Now the story? It's actually rather good. There are two stories, One concerns the death of Ra's-al Ghul and all his various daughter's (there's two-Talia and Nyssa) daddy issues, and they do have a few. Meanwhile, Ra's has approached Batman for the location of the last Lazarus Pit. Ra's is dying of old age and is willing to trade Bruce an alchemical potion that will allow him to speak with the dead. Specifically his parents. What follows is an interesting sequence where Bruce meets his mother and father. The scene where they see Batman in his full regalia is a great scene and again highlighted a panel where some detailed art would have been great. Anyways, the Batman-Ra's and the Talia-Nyssa twins band together to have a slug fest of a Lazarus Pit. Ra's, after spending all this time looking for a Lazarus Pit, allows himself to be supplanted by his chosen successor. Not saying who. It IS interesting.So all in all? A really interesting story. The Nyssa-Talia connection was a bit off, but I did enjoy the Batman-Ra's interactions as well as the intriguing Bruce talks to his parents plot. It is safe to say I liked the story. The art, while by no means putrid, is just mediocre. Batman fans should enjoy this volume. But get it for the story and not the art.",
            "3.5 stars. Oh man, how I've missed Batman. There will be minor spoilers in here, but I'll leave out all the good stuff just to leave you wondering and force you to read it yourself.As usual, I dove headfirst into this not having all of the very useful prior knowledge I probably should've had, but picked up most of it along the way. (Out of curiousity, does anyone else do that, or am I just weird and impatient?) Just for the record, I officially loathe Nyssa. This burgeoning hate shifted several times throughout the book as we learned more about her character: where she came from, what she's done, and - more importantly - just exactly what she's planning to do. I sympathize with her past, but she's taken a horrible situation and found a way to make it irrevocably worse (which is quite an achievement considering how messed up it was in the first place). I also - hold onto your proverbial hats - found myself gulp feeling bad for Talia Al Ghul. *insert violent gagging noises here* I'm honestly disgusted with myself for what horrors she later inflicts on Damian (who I'm actually growing a soft spot for, the little punk) but this is before all that, when she was younger and ignorant and reckless and finds herself in a position where she's just grasping for someone to hold onto. Well, Nyssa, quite sadistically, inserts herself into this position (after events that I cannot explain because that's just too many spoilers). Anyway, I kinda feel dirty now. If it wasn't 12:20 A.M. here in Toronto I'd be compelled to take a shower.There was also the entire other aspect that I also won't/can't get into much without blowing some important secrets, but I will say that Bruce gets the opportunity to possibly to talk to someone(s) who he thought for certain he would never, ever, get to speak with again - let alone hear their opinions on who he's become. I'll leave that cryptic note there.Honestly, I might get all the background/context from reading previous volumes, I might reread this and give it a slightly higher rating, but it didn't really blow me out of the water. But suffice to say, it was worth the read if for no other reason than to get some critical background on the warped and broken mind of Talia Al Ghul. And to watch poor Bruce get completely thrown for a loop. ",
            "At the time, this was billed as the last Ra's al Ghul story. Maybe that really was the intention at the time, but he's shown up a time or two since. The art doesn't really do anything for me, so let's put that aside right away. It's written by Greg Rucka, whose work in the Batverse is usually good for me. This time I just couldn't get into it. Maybe it's because the character of Nyssa wasn't connecting for me (not surprising, since she's written to be disconnected herself), or because I've never been thrilled by Ra's storylines. It is by no means bad, but it wasn't something I could connect to. I did like that the trade included some behind-the-scenes content in the back, comparing the original pencils to what ends up on the final page. I always love seeing that in a book."

            "When you\u2019ve read as much Batman as I have you basically look to the new stuff only in hopes of a great Batman story. So I was really surprised to find this overlooked 2004 storyline, Death and the Maidens, to be a hidden gem - and by Greg Rucka no less (I\u2019m not a huge fan)! Batman has been destroying Lazarus Pits (magical pools that rejuvenate and heal humans) leaving the centuries-old Ra\u2019s al-Ghul, whose long life depends on the Pits, vulnerable. Ra\u2019s is dying but makes a deal with Batman: give him a Pit and in return he\u2019ll give him a way to speak to his dead mother and father again. But Ra\u2019s daughter, Nyssa, has other plans for her hated father and she\u2019s going to use her half-sister Talia to help punish him\u2026 So this was unexpectedly awesome! Rucka introduces us to new character Nyssa and her conflicted and complex relationship with Ra\u2019s clearly and compellingly. We see their story unfold over the course of the book but it\u2019s told well so it never feels overly complicated or the flashbacks awkwardly placed. I was so into the al-Ghul\u2019s family history that I\u2019d have still enjoyed the comic without Batman! Meanwhile, Batman has an equally interesting parents/kids-themed plotline where he embarks on a lucid dream quest to talk with his dead parents, Thomas and Martha. Without giving anything away, it\u2019s thankfully not some syrupy, overwrought reunion and forces Bruce to ask some tough questions on his life choices. I thought it was fascinating stuff - seeing Batman emotionally challenged like this can be really exciting when it\u2019s done as well as it is here. I liked Klaus Janson\u2019s art for the most part (his style is a mix of Frank Miller and Howard Chaykin) and thought his pages in Ravensbruck were especially haunting and memorable. Often though his figures are a bit too warped and sketchy and his ridiculously-waisted Talia was laughable - like Rob Liefeld/Captain America bad! Aside from the silly Superman assassination plot that felt tacked-on at the end, Rucka\u2019s story is fast-moving and enthralling - it\u2019s quite a thick book comparatively but I blew through it because of the quality. The ending too is brilliant, it\u2019s just a shame DC failed to stick with it. Greg Rucka and Klaus Janson\u2019s Death and the Maidens is a great Batman book - highly recommended to all fans of the Dark Knight! ",
            "This may be my favorite Ra's al Ghul story I've read. This is also the best art I've seen out of Klaus Janson, an artist I typically don't care for at all. His art is usually scratchy and craggy. Here with Brian Buccellato's colors, it fits the story very well.Ra's is dying. Batman has been searching out the Lazarus pits and destroying them. A new character Nyssa is introduced who also wants revenge against Ra's. The book flashes back throughout Nyssa's life while Batman is given a potion that will allow him to communicate with the spirits of his parents. The story is never boring. There's some absolute brutal moments and real repercussions. It's a shame DC didn't stick with this story for longer.",
            "I love to read any and all Ra's Al Ghul stories. An immortal genocidal psychopath and alchemist? Sign me up! And this is definitely some of Rucka's and Janson's better work. This was a solid read with a slow start. But once Ra's and Batman showed up the story got moving. The five second pitch is this: Ra's needs Bats' help, and in exchange gives him a potion to talk with his dead parents. (Pretty cool, right?) Then Ra's' other daughter Nyssa tries to stop them both. That's the story. It's not exactly something unseen in 60 years of Batman, with the exception of the Thomas and Martha Wayne scene, but that, with more Lazarus pits and Al Ghul drama, was pretty cool. Klaus Janson is fantastic here, and way more refined than TDKR. His illustrations are clean and pleasantly sketchy. And Steve Buccellato's colors are a perfect compliment. This book is just wonderfully illustrated. So overall a solid 3.5 star Batman story of immortality, revenge, and haunted pasts, with awesome illustrations. Not essential, but if you like a Ra's or Talia Al Ghul story, or a story that delves into Batman's psychology, this is worth a buy. A Very Short Note on the Deluxe Edition...This is actually pretty nice for a DC OHC. The hardcover is sturdy with a glossy design, rather than a bland black paper, which is a nice touch. The paper, while a bit thin, is a good high gloss. And the binding is combined sewn and glued and lays flat, it's great! If you're a Batman fan you should definitely pick up this OHC, it's worth the price.",
            "Batman makes a deal to help Ra's Al Ghul in exchange for speaking with his dead parents but this is more of a tale as to the other daughter Ra's Al Ghul had and why she hates him so.Veteran writer Greg Rucka and veteran artist Klaus Janson contribute. OVERALL GRADE: B plus. "

            "This is the fourth and currently last installment of Penman's delightful Justin de Quincy mystery series. It is a shame that Penman's publishers have at least temporarily terminated the series, asking that she focus more on her longer historicals. I adore Penman's massive and meticulously researched historicals, but I also enjoy a short, fast and easy read at times, too. I can well imagine that these shorter works allow Penman to cleanse her mind between her longer works, utilizing her knowledge of the period while giving her imagination free reign. (Perhaps, she could self-publish these shorter works in e-book format if her publisher continues to balk?) While the mysteries in this series are not the most difficult to figure out, they are well drawn from the politics of the period. Furthermore, I love Penman's fictional characters and their interactions with real historical figures. Penman's imagined characters and plots are so believably realized and interwoven so well into the lives of the actual historical figures that often times the reader can't tell the difference until he/she reads the author's note included at the end of every book. I particularly enjoyed the interactions between the arch rivals, Durand and Justin, and their dealings with the Prince of Darkness himself, John, Count of Mortain (the future King John) in this book. The dialog between Durand and Justin was snappy and highly entertaining giving me several laugh out loud moments. I was particularly fascinated by the character of Morgan and was astonished to discover his true identity. In addition, Penman is able to successfully make the reader both appreciate and despise John -- an extremely difficult task considering how John has been portrayed throughout history in both literature and film. Penman never fails to educate and entertain me, I'm hopeful that I'll one day be able to read the further adventures of Justin de Quincy.",
            "Justin de Quincy has to help out Prince John (while Queen Eleanor is off ransoming King Richard)?! Oh my!!! Poor Justin! What a mess he has gotten himself into this time, and what fun for us!We've left England for France, searching for the people responsible for a plot to discredit John in Richard's eyes upon his return... and as Justin feels the Queen would want him to help her son, he does (and well, let's face it... the likelyhood of John inheriting Richard's throne is very high, can't hurt to help a possible future King). We get to explore corners of Paris, stretches of Brittany and the fabulous Mont Saint Michel in Normandy. Good times will be had (for us), and people will die. I read it in less than 24h, couldn't put it down! :)",
            "My book club invited the author to come visit us while we discussed this book, and we all enjoyed both the book and her visit. We were all impressed with how hard she works to keep the historical details correct, and to give an accurate portrait of life in that time period.",
            "Last of 4 fictional mysteries set with the Plantagenets. Queen Eleanor is away rescuing Richard Lionheart but Justin's 'holiday' soon gets derailed by a commission from John. Nice to see John in an almost positive light for a change! Pity Ms Penman didn't finish off her Plantagenet series with a biographical novel about John but she was pretty clear that it all ended with Richard. Tsk.The byplay between Justin and Durand is good fun - two secret agents of the queen (one being a double agent) who can't stand each other but have to work together. Historically pretty sound, this short series ended before Penman's best books were written (Devil's Brood and onward). Another pity she didn't write any more Justin de Quincy novels. Bah.",
            "Prince of Darkness follows a new Justin de Quincy: older, wiser and now a father, Justin has finally grown up. There's still a lot of commentary from other characters about his innocence, but his internal dialogue has matured.In this installment, Justin's working for Prince John, navigating the tangled knots of politics of both English and French courts as he seeks to clear John's name from a charge of high treason. Throwing Justin in with the man he most loathes was a great narrative concept and Penman handles the emotions, politics and historical description with her usual deft hand.Here's hoping there's more Justin in the future!!",
            "This mystery takes place during the medieval period in Europe. Richard Lionheart is on the throne and wary of contenders and someone has gone to great lengths to make it look as though his brother John is planning to kill him. Surprising, John calls upon the Queen's man, Justine de Quincy to help him prove that the letter that supposedly proves his guilt is forged. The story that follows in absorbing and full of many interesting and well drawn characters. While the culprit is being sought the reader gets a taste of the times and its moral and social character. (For example I found it interesting that the English royalty of the time did not speak English.)",
            "This is another book I picked up without knowing much about it, but it sounded interesting. I've not heard of a medieval mystery before. I've never been one for historical fiction, and I've never been one for mystery, but the two together? I thought, 'why not?'Putting aside the fact that I jumped in with the fourth book in a series, I thought it was really good. I was unsure in the beginning, especially since it was so slow and there were so many people I couldn't keep track of (because I'd just met them, whereas if I'd done the smart thing and started at the beginning I'd have been familiar with them already), but as the narrative went on I grew increasingly invested. I liked Justin, and the fact that he's head over heels for his daughter is both heartwarming and heart wrenching. He may not have appreciated spending so many months with Durand, either, but I did. They make a fun team to read. And don't get me started on Morgan. I had suspicions that he was more than he seemed, but I didn't think he was that much more. He was fun and lively and entertaining. The pacing throughout the narrative was fairly slow and even, with pockets of activity, but the smoothness of the writing and transitioning from one scene to the next was well done, pulling me along until the very end. I'd have to say that I enjoyed it very much, and I can really appreciate the research Penman did in the crafting of this book - the politics and royal intrigue is such a brain twister! I am definitely on board with going back to the beginning and learning more about Justin's story and all the crazy adventures he's had leading up to this point. We're not through!"

            "So I was a bit disappointed in this book. It was VERY slow starting. Now, this is somewhat to be expected with the first book in a trilogy, but by VERY slow\u2026 I mean a good 85% of the book was all character development. Not even exciting character development. Nope, the protagonist was getting trained, getting laid, and having pretty much no adventures along the way. And in all of that character development, the author never managed to make me identify with or really like his protagonist. I don\u2019t DISLIKE him, but the whole character archetype just seemed a bit contrived and one dimensional to me (think SUPER assassin, ninja, philosopher, duelist - RaaRR!). The last few chapters were definitely good, and I have hope that the next few books will be pretty action packed. All that time spent in training has made the main character into one bad-ass force to be reckoned with, and he\u2019s hell bent on a path towards revenge and intrigue. So I have high hopes for the next two books and will hopefully be posting glowing reviews here soon. ",
            "Actual rating: 2,5Mostly, this book just served to remind me of why I prefer modern fantasy. In my experience, older fantasy tend to focus significantly less on the individual and his/her feelings and development, instead leaning heavily on honor and often some kind of epic quest. This was the case here, and I definitely did not like it. I like my characters human and complex and, most importantly, I want to be by their side every step of the way and feel with them as they grow and change. Talon of the Silver Hawk is about revenge, yet I found it flat and unemotional. That statement alone speaks volumes. A story of revenge is all about emotion and conflicts, remove this and you take away what is human and fascinating. Sadly, the criticism is not yet over. In stark contrast to the almost overwhelmingly complex and intricate cultures in the Empire trilogy, all the cultures presented here were sloppy and shallow. In short, Talon of the Silver Hawk was a disappointment and a decidedly unpromising start to a series."

            "Heroes Journey. Traditional.That being said, I honestly had a good time following this future era, post-Krondor war building of a hero. Young/old Pug is here, briefly, but for the most part, this is not of magic, but the crafting of one quick boy into a hell of a weapon.Simple premise, really, and one we've all seen, but I really enjoyed the journey. The last of his tribe, he's taken in by the Conclave of Shadows, full of magicians and spies, trained and inducted in their order, and is sent out into the world to infiltrate and get everyone ready for the evil that spreads through the land. This is Feist at his most crafty. The story might be old but it is still very entertaining. Lots of sword-play, some intrigue, and even more REVENGE. :) In other words, all the things we usually turn to when it comes to old-style fantasy. I've read much worse and only a few that do this better. But all-in-all? I can definitely recommend this for sheer entertainment value if not world-building, epic-building, or mind-blowing reveals.",
            "This is the Raymond E. Feist that I like, the author who narrates an epic story without hurrying, taking his time to put us in the right mood. This is certainly true at the beginning of the story where we meet a young man, a member of a tribe with a distinct culture, who, in the midst of a maturation ritual, is confronted with tragic events and thus devotes his life to revenge. To reach that point, however, he has to go through many stages and meet people who will make him a powerful and brilliant warrior. In this making most of the book is devoted to describing it in a very good way, although in some cases he goes very fast. With this we arrive at an action-packed finale, in a field, that is, where the writer is at his best. Of course there are some exaggerations, but if you not make a fuss about them you will enjoy some very dramatic moments.In other words, this trilogy begins with an interesting and delightful book. I have some objections to the excesses of the plot and to some points where the author could give more details, which would of course make the book bigger but would be - at least for me - even more interesting. Positive, however, is the one piece of politics that is at the core of this story that seems to be more grounded and not based so much on magic. With this the second part seems to me that it will be just as interesting, so I will begin to read it immediately.\u0391\u03c5\u03c4\u03cc\u03c2 \u03b5\u03af\u03bd\u03b1\u03b9 \u03bf Raymond E.

            "Talon of the Silver Hawk is the first book in Conclave of Shadows, yet another subseries in the very long Riftwar Cycle by Raymond E. Feist. After the previous 7 books which had returned to some earlier time periods in the series, this book resumes our forward chronological progress and is set about 30 years after the Serpentwar Saga.This was a solid, entertaining read. It mostly focused on brand new characters and less familiar settings. I really liked the characters, including the main character, Talon. Talon was maybe a bit too talented with too many different types of skills to be completely believable, but I enjoyed him and his story anyway. This book didn\u2019t hold anything groundbreaking or unusual for epic fantasy, and in fact it depended on several tried and true tropes, but Feist writes them well and I never lost interest. I had been hoping to see some follow-up with Jimmy the Hand\u2019s grandsons, Jimmy and Dash, but the 30-year jump in the time frame means we skipped over the events I\u2019d been interested in seeing at the end of the Serpentwar Saga. The characters were briefly mentioned, but not seen. I don\u2019t know if we\u2019ll get to see more of them in later books, but I get the impression from the subseries titles of the remaining books that we probably won\u2019t go back in time to fill in any of that 30-year gap unless there are some flashbacks. In any case, I also look forward to seeing what happens next with the characters introduced in this book.",
            "I was hoping for something better. It is a classic setting fantasy: a boy who came from nothing, the only survivor of the village massacre, trains to revenge. I have nothing against classic fantasy. Indeed, I chose this book also because I wanted a classic fantasy. But too many things I didn't like. We pay from the protagonist, the Gary Stue more Gary Stue of all. He knows how to do everything. He not only does he easily learn anything but he soon becomes the best. The best swordsman. The best cook. The best painter. He suddenly sounds half-five hundred musical instruments. In bed is a phenomenon, they want them all (on the front of women I will return after). I don't like these protagonists, who seem to never have a difficulty, no obstacle makes them falter. Claw / talon could be a beautiful character, but it is not at all characterized, nor have I managed to feel empathy for him and the mission of him ... indeed, most of the time I hated it. It is a shame because the origin of him Orosin of him (people clearly inspired by Native Americans) could offer so many ideas. Instead he immediately loses his culture, so there is no difference between him and all the other characters. Female characters: I would gladly do without these 3 (yes only 3) girls from the interchangeable personality. Their only role in the plot is to go to bed with talon. Literally it's the only thing they do. In addition, the approach with him is the same repeated 3 times. Bad representation. The Worldbuilding is not original, is the classic European Alternative Middle Ages. The Orisino people would have been much more interesting, because we could finally see something different. Furthermore, some more descriptions would allow me to imagine some cities or palace. I missed my magic. I will also read the second because I hope for an improvement.",
            "Really 2 1/2 stars. Granted, I read this way too soon after the Kingkiller books which set a crazy high standard...but this book really under delivered.It started off promising. None of the poetry of Rothfuss, but definitely some interesting concepts. Talon's culture, a pretty obvious analogue to Native American culture, sets up an interesting character and premise. A revenge story? I'm in. Even when Talon starts to become trained with logic games etc. etc., I was still pretty interested. I liked the tension between Talon's assimilating education and his devotion to his native culture/identity. Feist hints at larger political games-I'm still on board- presents some intriguing secondary characters-still with it-and then he introduces the magic-and I am disappointed.It is magic staff kind of magic, instant teleportation and all that jazz, and there's an all-powerful magician and some kind of secret, insidious, growing oppositional power and it is boring. The pacing of the story slows way down(the beginning is also kind of slow, but I attributed it to exposition, turns out this entire book is exposition) and there are temporal jumps and hops and an effort to reveal more of some kind of web of power or political chess game or whatever. And it is boring! Even the fencing battles feel clunky and slow as opposed to the sitting-on-the-edge of your seat feeling in both Kingkiller and Alera and Lynch's Gentlemen Bastards (seriously, if you haven't read Rothfuss', Butcher's, or Lynch's books, you need to stop what you're doing and go read them). Ultimately, it's just run of the mill. I think I'll take a look at the second installment of this series to see if it gets any more exciting or different, but I think I'd only recommend this if you haven't read fantasy for a while and are really just jonesing for a fix. But it's like skunk weed. You read it just to get a little taste, but it doesn't really take you anywhere.",
            "This is a good 3.5. Will definitely check out the next one in the series and more of Feist's work. A gripping escapist adventure."

            "Since I'm giving this second volume a higher rating than the first one, I'll explain why it was an improvement:The artwork overall here was much better, there weren't any stories that looked like they were drawn by a third grader. One part even had drawings that looked like grayscale photography.This volume also wasted less space by putting the biographies of the writers and artists at the end.Not only that, but...unlike many modern comic book omnibuses, the quotient of objectionable content was kept low. Profanity was at a minimum, and sometimes merely implied instead of written out, disturbing images and bloody scenes were few and far between, and there wasn't much suggestive content, although one story implied the Dark Knight's infamous villainesses seducing men, though it wasn't graphic, thankfully.All that said, it wasn't a tremendous improvement over the previous installment, merely a slight one. Still, that's a step in the right direction.",
            "This goes for probably quite a number of anthologies out there, but Volume 2 of the \u201cBatman: Black and White\u201d series reads like the result of a creative workshop. Not that Volume 1 was altogether different, since in both cases you have the pairing of a comic book writer and an illustrator (sometimes there is one person behind all the work, like in most group projects), given the task to create a very short story about the Caped Crusader. I have no idea whether the dynamic duos have been paired at random or chosen based on some sort of selection, but throughout the first three quarters of the volume it felt like the gods of lottery had been in the mood for some serious pranking here. Granted, I did have the opportunity to reencounter two of my most beloved artists (beloved for their work on my favourite childhood superhero comic), but neither was impressive here. There was Paul Dini\u2019s very good and very canonical origin croquis, unfortunately paired with an extremely irritating drawing style, an instance where Paul Rivoche\u2019s clean, classic artwork overshadowed a fair but clich\u00e9 plot, another where you could recognise Dave Gibbons\u2019 drawing in a heartbeat, yet another where Enrique Breccia\u2019s very specific visual style, that had at first seemed too frenetic and chaotic, proved itself remarkably complementary to the story. You\u2019ll also find Howard Chaykin\u2019s and Jordi Bennett\u2019s decent comic relief, a parody of old-school comics from the fifties, in plot, mind-set and drawing style alike. But distinguishing itself from anything offered here, stands a rounded story about Batman\u2019s confrontation with Green Lantern, a hero so very different from himself, as well as his confrontation with his own beliefs and actions. Here you have it, black on white (pun intended), how much contents can be fitted into so little space. Good in itself, Alan Brennert\u2019s story is trumped with superb artwork by Jos\u00e9 Luis Garc\u00eda-L\u00f3pez. So superb that I feel like digging up as much of his work as I can. His use of perspective, diagonal panels and his presentation of motion reminded me of my favourite classic X-Men story drawn by Neal Adams, though Garc\u00eda-L\u00f3pez\u2019 work here is more sophisticated.Unlike Volume 1, which contained an introduction, commentaries, panel studies and what not, this issue is quite bare and stripped to its essentials. Quite a number of the stories are so crazily short that there is not even a chance to develop anything resembling a narrative. A vast majority of the artwork is distorted and jumbled, mostly indecipherable. On top of that, the entire concept is already familiar through Volume 1, so that all the contributions delivered here would have had it far more difficult anyway to make an impact. They lack the element of novelty. And they are in total not very good either. Two halfway decent woks, two reasonable ones, one surprisingly good and one remarkable are not enough to save the anthology\u2019s honour. They go under in a mess of raw concepts and frenzied lines that feel like something created by a spider high on caffeine and anxiety. In fact, hardly anything could win against some examples of hopeless imbecility, nor against people who should never ever be allowed near a drawing board or a script. The few sound stories in this volume make honourable exceptions which would have deserved better treatment and better company. Just like the editor should have been able to cut his losses and face the fact that some things just won\u2019t do. As it is, this collection feels mostly like a pot of leftovers somebody didn\u2019t have the heart or character to throw away. "

            "There are 21 short stories depicted in black, white and gray purposefully. Several of the tales are little moments to a side of Batman one rarely sees. Overall, I found some of the stories quite engaging or just funny in a goofy manner. Others fell quite flat or were just plain ho hum. This is one of those tales in which the artwork was more impressive than the plots.Some notable writers were Paul Dini, Warren Ellis, Chris Claremont, Paul Pope and Harlan Ellison. There's a nice collection of Batman graphic novels to check out in the very back.My favorite three tales were: \u201cBatsman: Swarming Scourge of the Underworld\u201d (by Ty Templeton and artwork by Marie Severin . .. it had some of the funniest moments even though the ending was lame), \u201cBlackout (some good character focuses on Batman with Catwoman using old style artwork and phrases by Howard Chaykin and illustrated by Jordi Bernet) and \u201cThe Bet\u201d (by Paul Dini and illustrated by Ronnie Del Carmen . . . another silly tale in which Poison Ivy and Harley Quinn see who can get the most men to kiss them). STORY/PLOTTING: B minus, CHARACTERS/DIALOGUE: B minus to B, ARTWORK PRESENTATION: B to B plus, SOMETHING NEW WITH BATMAN: B to B plus, OVERALL GRADE: B minus to B, WHEN READ: end of June 2012. ",
            "The second volume of Batman: Black &amp, White is much like the first. Editor Mark Chiarello gathers together some of the most acclaimed writers and artists who then produce short stories about The Dark Knight. While I didn\u2019t find the overall experience as strong as the first collection, there were still some pretty great tales inside.The collection opens up on a strong note with some excellent artwork by the uber-talented Alex Ross. Ross brings his ultra-realistic style to a story written by Batman: The Animated Series scribe Paul Dini, about two doctors discussing whether or not The Joker really is as insane as he appears to be. The story that follows, dubbed \u201cBatsman\u201d, is a parody featuring The Caped Crusader. Unfortunately, it suffers from such an odd placement in the collection. I\u2019m not sure why the decision was made to stick this light-hearted comedy after an intense and moody drama but I felt it ruined the flow and took me directly out of the book.There are a few duds littered throughout that I didn\u2019t really care for. John Byrne takes us back to an earlier Batman style, seemingly inspired by the 70s dynamic duo days before Frank Miller\u2019s resurgence of The Bat in the 1980s. It\u2019s not bad per say, I\u2019m sure it captures the vibe that he intended, but it\u2019s just not my thing. I prefer a darker and grittier Batman style.While overall, I didn\u2019t feel like it was as strong as the first volume, there are some gems hidden in here. Stories by Warren Ellis, Brian Azzerello, Harlen Ellison and a second tale by Paul Dini all shine and would be a crime to miss.Cross Posted @ Every Read Thing",
            "Like the first \u201cBatman: Black &amp, White\u201d collection, this anthology contains some of the biggest names in comics putting together short Batman stories in black and white, but the overall effect is uneven with some great stories, some awful stories, and quite a lot of so-so stories. My favourite by far in this collection was the opening story called \u201cCase Study\u201d by Paul Dini and drawn by Alex Ross, which takes a look at the Joker before he became the Joker and questions whether he really is crazy or not. After all, how could a crazy person put together and carry out so many complex criminal schemes? Couple Dini\u2019s superb writing with Ross\u2019 art and you\u2019ve got a winner every time. Dini also contributed an excellent short called \u201cThe Bet\u201d where Harley and Ivy, bored while locked up in Arkham, make a bet to see who can kiss the most guards. Drawn by Ronnie Del Carmen in Bruce Timm\u2019s style, it\u2019s a fun story but if you\u2019ve read the Dini/DC \u201cHarley and Ivy\u201d book then you\u2019ll have already read this as it\u2019s included in that book as well (in colour too).Warren Ellis and Jim Lee\u2019s \u201cTo Become the Bat\u201d is an effective look back at how Batman developed the skills he has while inter-splicing scenes of a case he\u2019s currently working on showing him using those skills. Lee\u2019s art is excellent and Ellis masterfully concocts a layered story within just a few pages. Walter Simonson and John Paul Leon\u2019s \u201cThe Riddle\u201d riffs on the ever-present Lewis Carroll themes in Gotham by having the Riddler seek out the answer to the unanswered riddle in \u201cAlice in Wonderland\u201d (\u201cWhy is a raven like a writing desk?\u201d) in the house of a dead billionaire who was obsessed with Carroll. Leon\u2019s art is brilliantly zany, taking familiar characters from Wonderland and darkly warping them while Batman appears as a sinister Cheshire Bat. The rest of the stories have moments that I thought were interesting like exploring what Batman got up to in WW2, or a conversation between Batman and Zsasz while waiting for the GCPD to show up, and some of the art is fantastic. But overall, the book contains a few good stories but mostly only some mildly entertaining stuff - the rest is very forgettable. \u201cB&amp,W, Vol 2\u201d is definitely not a must-read book of the Batman canon. ",
            "It's an anthology, so of course it's a mixed bag, both from an art and story perspective. There are some really outstanding stories here. Paul Dini's Case Study, the first story in the collection, is a nice and perceptive look at Joker's psychology, painting him as someone completely sane, possibly even hyper-sane, who uses the trappings of insanity as a mask. Howard Chaykin's Blackout took me surprise. It's set in the 40s and co-stars Catwoman, and surprised me by being an honestly good period piece. Most of the other pieces are decent reads, though there are a few clunkers. I very much could have done without Batsman or Snow Job, and The Black and White Bandit is almost painfully forgettable. But there's more than enough good here to make this a worthwhile read, for Batman fans.",
            "Batman: Black and White, Vol. 2 is a Batman anthology featuring black-and-white Batman short stories. Written and illustrated by various writers and pencilers, Batman: Black and White 2 is an anthology of backup stories from Batman: Gotham Knights #1\u201316 with a handful of new short stories. This trade paperback collects Batman: Gotham Knights #1\u201316 backup stories with five new stories.For the most part, I really like most of these entries \u2013 the black and white gave the dark noir feeling that this anthology was trying to capture. Like most anthologies, there are weaker contributions, but that is only comparatively speaking, as even the mediocre stories were quite good.With many writers, graphic artists and colorist it rather difficult to rate this anthology. For the most part, I rather enjoyed the narrative and penciling throughout \u2013 DC Comics has chosen their best luminaries and have them develop a short story. The penciling is a tad inconsistent, but it was not a problem as each story was rather short and the dislike of any penciling or writing style would be over quite quickly.All in all, Batman: Black and White, Vol. 2 is a wonderful collection of short stories detective noir stories featuring Batman or one of his associates written and penciled by the cr\u00e8me de la cr\u00e8me of DC Comics best.",
            "This is such a high class series. I reread my review from a few years ago of volume 4 and I feel the same way about this one - no one story is a classic but as a whole they are such fun and such a delight to read and the art is 5+ stars. It is wonderful tot see these top class artists let loose in Black and White.  I said there was no one all star story but I will highlight three that were my favourites. There was one by Dave Gibbons that I loved because it was so smart and clever. It actually embraced the B&amp,W theme by giving Batman a Black and White villain who commits colorless crimes because he was struck down by color blindness. So like Two face who always commits crimes invovling two he commits crimes that have a black and white theme. There is one drawn by Jos\u00e9 Lu\u00eds Garcia-Lopez - the story is ho hum with Green Lantern and Batman but that art should be in a museum. JLG-L has not lost a step in his fourth decade in comics. There is also a cute one by Harlan Ellison with perfect art by Ha (Top Ten artist). I really love this collection. Simple, perfect, 6 page stories. Pure fun. "

            "This is a must read for anyone involved with, pondering or subject to measurement. That should include essentially everyone. Robert Austin brilliantly covers a hard topic in a nuanced way, dispensing stern advice and warnings along the way. You'll learn about how, and when, measurements will lead to dysfunction, alternative modes and pointers what to do instead. For those reaching chapter 18 Societal Implications and Extensions and wanting a good treatise on the subject instead of a heap of questions I recommend Bruce Schneier's Liars and Outliers http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12...",
            "Measuring and Managing Performance in Organizations is an excellent retort to those that believe If you can't measure it, you can't manage it to be gospel. The book breaks down measurement scenarios into two categories: partial and complete supervision. Under complete supervision, every nuance of a worker's productivity is observed and understood by management and therefore measurement is an appropriate tool to increase efficiency and motivate workers. However under partial supervision, which is more common particularly in knowledge work, measurement schemes can actually harm efficiency as the workers attempt to optimize the observable measurements to the detriment of the unobservable measurements, to maximize personal gain. It is here that the mechanistic cockpit analogy of measurement falls apart. Measuring worker output is not analogous to a cockpit, where the manager has access to various dials. Rather partial supervision is analogous to a cockpit in which there are small gremlins controlling each dial, adjusting them to manager feedback instead of reality. Even measurement solely for information purposes, and not for compensation, can be construed as such and therefore can be detrimental to production. Instead, for situations where only partial measurement is possible, the author recommends no supervision or delegatory management, whereby the manager communicates to his/her subordinates the overall goal, and leaves the implementation to the subordinates. In fact, in an ideal setting, the subordinate queries the manager when needed, as opposed to being commanded. I found this to be quite similar to the Hire managers of one advice from Rework.One recommendation that was suspect was how Eastern companies rely on culture, loyalty, and assimilation instead of incentives to achieve high productivity. Unfortunately Eastern companies provide lifetime employment and are reticent to remove obviously underperforming employees, which is probably too far in the other direction.In short, organizational measurement systems are high cost, are very difficult to implement correctly, and are not only unhelpful but counterproductive due to the fact that the people being measured are aware of it and often adjust deleteriously in unmeasured ways.",

        "desc": "Now a Broadway Play.An innovative essayist and his fact-checker do battle about the use of truth and the definition of nonfiction.How negotiable is a fact? In 2003, after publishing his book of experimental essays, Halls of Fame, John D\u2019Agata was approached by Harper\u2019s magazine to write an essay for them, one that was eventually rejected due to disagreements related to its fact checking. That essay which eventually became the foundation of D\u2019Agata\u2019s critically acclaimed About a Mountain was accepted by another magazine, the Believer, but not before they handed it to their own fact-checker, Jim Fingal. What resulted from that assignment, and beyond the essay\u2019s eventual publication in the magazine, was seven years of arguments, negotiations, and revisions as D\u2019Agata and Fingal struggled to navigate the boundaries of literary nonfiction.This book includes an early draft of D\u2019Agata\u2019s essay, along with D\u2019Agata and Fingal\u2019s extensive discussion around the text. What emerges is a brilliant and eye-opening meditation on the relationship between \u201ctruth\u201d and \u201caccuracy\u201d and a penetrating conversation about whether it is appropriate for a writer to substitute one for the other.",

            "As of the writing of this review, I am the only person to give The Lifespan of a Fact fewer than three stars. This, I think, is clearly a case of a book preaching to its choir. Those who choose to read a (windy) transcript of a dispute between an essayist (John D'Agata) and a fact-checker (Jim Fingal) on the struggle between fact and truth are perhaps predisposed to 'enjoy' it. It isn't a book likely to be discovered by an audience uninterested in its themes. Accurately or not, I would tend to count myself as a constituent of this book's target audience. I am, after all, a writer (of sorts). I am often embarrassingly passionate about esoteric, philosophical topics. I'm intrigued by, if not entirely won over by the trickery of literary postmodernism. I am concerned, ambivalently, with pure aesthetics\u2014that is, art divested of moral responsibility. And I am a nerd who enjoys eavesdropping on a hifalutin discourse.But... The Lifespan of a Fact, overall, strikes me as a failure. First of all\u2014and despite Maggie Nelson's back cover blurb\u2014it is monotonous and not 'compulsively readable.' (If priggish fact-checker Jim Fingal were analyzing the phrase 'compulsively readable,' he would probably write two or more long paragraphs on the distinction between literal readability i.e., being able to be read versus the connotation of being enjoyable to read. He would ultimately give the phrase a pass, although he would be bothered by the figurative use of the adverb compulsively.)What The Lifespan of a Fact is comprised of is the reprint of an essay by John D'Agata about suicide in Las Vegas accompanied by Fingal's scrupulous (and tedious) fact-checking notes\u2014as well as D'Agata's snide responses to these notes. I am not faulting a fact-checker for being tedious. It's certainly his job, in a sense. But I am faulting the publishing powers-that-be for imagining this might be an interesting or enlightening read.I would estimate that the detailing of factual quibbles make up 80% (or more) of the book. Only the remaining scraps of the book engage in spirited discourse about the goals and responsibility of essays/'non-fiction' (which is a contentious genre for D'Agata). Once the reader gets the feel for the pattern\u2014Fingal increasingly nitpicks in retaliation to D'Agata's perceived ethical failures\u2014it's just a matter of riding out the book, with its droning barrage of fact corrections.D'Agata and Fingal, as represented in the book, are both extremely unlikeable. D'Agata is sniping and petulant. His grandiose formulas for the essay are as moralistic and childish as Fingal's needling scrutiny. Once Fingal realizes what he's dealing with, he spitefully extends his fact-checking authority to the sources cited by D'Agata. In other words, he not only checks to see whether people said what they were quoted as saying, but he also judges the truth-claims of their quotes. Clearly, he is a fact-checker run amok.D'Agata's position that essayists are not beholden to facts and may change them liberally to arrive at 'truth' is nothing but postmodernist nonsense, in my opinion. The essay (as it exists today) is a culturally established exchange between writer and audience endowed with certain expectations. D'Agata's prickly response is essentially, if I may paraphrase, that the audience is wrong\u2014or as he puts it 'ignorant.' I would question how the audience is expected to arrive at D'Agata's understanding of the rules of the essay if they aren't edified in some way\u2014if there isn't some 'opening' onto this knowledge. Readers will leave the essay on Levi Presley's suicide believing that it is factually accurate. If they never come to understand the essay otherwise, how will they be enlightened and come to appreciate D'Agata's use of the genre? As Fingal, I think, correctly diagnoses, D'Agata is contemptuous of his readers\u2014looking down on them from the rarefied temple of 'art.'More to the point, perhaps, D'Agata's liberties do not make for a compelling essay! In the end, he falsified and distorted the facts to arrive at an entirely mundane 'truth.' If only his writing were as exalted as his theories...",
            "Quick edit(3/22/12): In surveying some of the professional reviews out there (and on here), I've been surprised by one strand of criticism in particular, the heart of which seems to stem from this line on the back cover: This book reproduces D\u2019Agata\u2019s essay, along with D\u2019Agata and Fingal\u2019s extensive correspondence. It has since emerged that the quotes we get from Fingal and D'Agata have been edited/selectively chosen/made up wholesale for the sake of this book/etc., thereby beefing up the internal drama of what was more likely a humdrum fact-checking process.I've thought about it and while there may be some tap-dancing on the part of the authors going on, I still don't think it invalidates the point they're trying to make, or at least the questions they're getting you to ask. It never occurred to me that their email exchanges hadn't been doctored to some extent for this publication. Of course this isn't a verbatim transcript of their argument, why would it be? Another reviewer here said it best: This book isn't a book about an essay, this book is an essay. It would be kind of self-defeating for a book that is trying to address the allegiance to Facts in pursuit of Truth to issue a disclaimer at the beginning that parts of it might be exaggerated.I'm not saying you shouldn't be bothered that the authors might be playing fast and loose with their shelving classifications. But in a book that is essentially asking you to question the nature of nonfiction, why would the authors expect you to exempt their own book in the process?---------First things first: You're going to want to read this as a hard copy. I'm sure you could get away with reading it on a tablet, but you probably need good ol' print to truly appreciate the design. D'Agata's essay runs in the middle of the page, with Fingal's factual disputes and D'Agata's testy responses surrounding it. It's really cool and visually appealing, and according to the book, it was designed by Chris Welch, so high credit to him.As for the book itself, its immediate selling point is that the author and fact-checker engage in feisty repartee throughout. There are definite laughs to be had when D'Agata tells Fingal things like, Tread very carefully, asshole. Here's a representative exchange:Fingal: Can't find any reference to this ordinance anywhere. John?D'Agata: Not sure, but I'm sure I could find it if nailing down this tiny little fact is that important.Fingal: 'Important' is relative at this point. But I'd like to have it for the sake of thoroughness.D'Agata: OK, will hunt around.Fingal: Awesome, thank you. And you know, while we've hit some rough patches off and on, I think things are looking pretty good.D'Agata: Sorry, can't find it.But there's a deeper argument at work here, one that slowly emerges as you wend through the text, and one that may change how you read what you assume to be nonfiction. D'Agata stakes out a territory somewhere between fiction and nonfiction (which he says are two arbitrary designations publishers came up with that everyone else is now forced to choose between) and argues that the essay form almost requires the manipulation of facts in order to make the author's vision appear true.One of David Foster Wallace's most memorable pieces is the cruise ship essay, which is always cited as among the most observant, funniest essays of its time -- and yet Jonathan Franzen more or less confirmed that great chunks of it were at least embellished, if not more. Does that make the essay worse? Does it diminish Wallace's points, or does it actually enhance them to know that he engaged in something other than reportage? As Tim O'Brien writes about in The Things They Carried, is it possible that story-truth is more true than capital-T Truth?The book reaches its climax at page 107, when Fingal and D'Agata finally get to the heart of their arguments (some 7 years after the project started!) The insults and snarkiness give way to a sincere, important, thought-provoking debate about the division between Truth and Story-Truth. Fingal says that this essay is the only account of Levi Presley's suicide that 99.99% of all people will ever read, so we are duty-bound for the record to getting it right -- saying he fell for 9 seconds for thematic purposes when it was really 8 will over time erode the reader's trust in the author and ultimately negate what he's trying to say. D'Agata, who for the duration has stressed he is not a journalist, counters, An essay is an attempt, Jim. Nothing else ... and so, as a writer of essays, my interpretation of that charge is that I try - that I try - to take control of something before it is lost entirely to chaos.I think the majority of people will side with Fingal for the bulk of this book, if not the entire book -- especially as D'Agata casually dismisses/insults Fingal throughout for doing his job. But with his final declaration, D'Agata may swing the pendulum more in his direction. At any rate, The Lifespan of a Fact is a book that should be read, considered, and discussed. Check it out.",

And have you the heart to apply the prosaic rules of evidence to a case which bubbles over with poetical emotion? Iolanthe, Act IGilbert and Sullivan, 1882I am very frustrated with John D\u2019Agata and Jim Fingal\u2019s The Lifespan of a Fact. The four stars are because there is a lot here for a reader consider. The material is engaging and intelligent. There are words that may keep this from being read by many people and the suicide of a teen ager is not likely to be a topic for family night reading. I first heard of John D\u2019Agato and Jim Fingal\u2019s book The Life Span of a Fact was in a review of the New York stage, I understood this to be about the problem of wiring a story in the age of \u201cFake News\u201d and the apparent righteousness of body slamming a reporter. The media has a long history of self-critism and this looked to be a chance to read some intelligent arguments about the way the media have been politicized (actually it has been for many decades going back to when newspaper publishers routinely ran for and won office), and what has morphed into weaponized divisive argument that defies what America should be about.The Life Span is about none of that. In fact it is a debate whose time has either gone or cannot be vital until more immediate public concerns have been brought down from the precipice of bombing, (here in the US, mass shooting (In France) and the deliberate state sponsored murder of a reporter (Jamal Khashoggi). In Life Span the case is made that by calling your product an essay, the author has infinite freedom to rewrite prosaic history in the name of whatever esoteric poetical emotional truth that fits the writer. At the time my used edition was published in 2012 this may have been an important topic. In 2018 it adds poison to a well where the water has already been made bitter.The book itself is a dramatization of an actual series of exchanges between an essayist and a fact checker. The essay in question is about the Las Vegas suicide by jumping by a teenager, Levi Presley. We are not told if the editor intends to publish the essay as a literal recitation of the facts or as a dramatization of the facts. John D\u2019Agato is a well-established essayist. He has definite beliefs about the term. In this book he will argue passionately that the writer must serve art in preference to fact, if by doing so the essayist helps the reader to experience a deeper and more aesthetically meaningful appreciation of the events under discussion. In fact the essay is a poorly defined medium of expression and it is legitimately plastic in the matter of content. A case can be made that it occupies literary space between fiction and non-fiction. D\u2019Agato goes further, insisting that the term Non-fiction is new and that facts are rarely absolute. He tosses out several famously named essayists arguing that the history of the essay is the history of exactly his understanding of the rights and duties of the essayist. Earlier he established that in taking this assignment he made it clear to the editor that he is not a reporter and that he will not be bound by the rules of journalism.Perhaps on the strength of this warning, Jim Fingal is tasked with fact checking the proposed article and in writing he is ordered to \u201ccomb through this marking anything and everything\u2026\u201d In taking the assignment, Jim is at once literal and increasingly meticulous and unforgiving. His questions everything from the number of seconds given for the boy\u2019s fall to the color of bricks and the exact routes between locations. The author comes off as an arrogant, defender of his every invention and demonstrably wrong statement. The Fact Checker become so focused on his mission he will even challenge the facts as given in the report from the Coroner\u2019s office. Ultimately I had little patience with either person.D\u2019Agata will on two occasions make appeals to authority. In logic this argument can count as a fallacy or not. The way D\u2019Agata applies the technique it is fallacious. He states the rules were set out by the ancient Roman orator, Cicero, among othesr and D'Agata does not state those laws. Worse the writer states that If his readers feel betrayed when they realize how often an ostensibly nonfiction article is in fact fictional, he turns on the readership, complaining that they are too poorly educated to understand the writer\u2019s rights. D\u2019Agata could have made a reference to the failure of the 1913 audience to appreciate Stravinsky\u2019s The Rite of Spring. There the portion of the audience that was known to reject anything new were when presented with ultra-modern music and lacking appreciation for the non-traditional choreography of Vaslav Nijinsky, rioted. Instead the 2018 reader has the peculiar juxtaposing of a writer arguing for \u201cFake News\u201d if the fakery is in service of art, and a time where the press is under increasing demands to clear not only the kinds of niggling fact checking of Fingal, but the creation of elaborate, fictional conspiracies to replace the prosaic, researched and fact checked. The Lifespan of a Fact is good writing. It is not apropos to the moment and does not serve D\u2019Agata. It is a good book, but a prospective reader needs to know that this is not about journalism. It is a high-level discussion of a very particular type of writing, the essay.",
            "Okay, so this miiiiiight not get five stars from me if I didn't know Jim personally (and think he's pretty much a wonderful human being). But in terms of reviewing MY experience reading it, totally five stars. I laughed out loud literally dozens of times. I love the whole concept, and it was so well-executed. And beautiful! I think the way they did the layout is incredibly clever and effective and cool. In a funny sort of way, I think this is a great book for people who love great character arcs in their books. It's ostensibly a book about journalism and non-fiction writing and essays and truth, but it's actually also a book about two very funny, very smart guys having a super interesting conversation, and just BRINGING it in terms of both the intellectual fire-power and the snark. My dinner with Andre for the Longreads set? Anyway, I don't care SO much about how many tons of concrete were used to construct a high-rise hotel, but I still enjoyed the hell out of this. Read it! Recommend! Yay Jim! ",
            "Fact checking can be mind numbing. I know. I've done it professionally. I've also been the writer on the other side of the table. In my experience, most writers are happy to have their articles fact checked, and to talk through any discrepancies that arise. I always was. It gave me the chance to make sure I was saying exactly what I wanted to say (even after going over the words in multiple edits), and it provided a safety net against a lawsuit if I should happen to get something wrong (we're all human, and it happens). But not every editing experience goes smoothly. This one certainly doesn't.This particular fact-checking experience is more extreme than any I've ever had, primarily because the author is so touchy about every word. He has so much pride wrapped up in this article! And while I can certainly understand an author wanting to craft the words perfectly for greatest impact, I was decidedly on the fact checker's side here. There's simply a lot to be said for conducting oneself with humility in interpersonal conflict.You may think that watching an exchange about publishing a magazine article might be boring, but in fact, it's fascinating, and it makes you consider how far one could or should go in the craft of writing and at the expense of the facts. Can't an article be both beautifully written and factually correct? The way John D'Agata puts it, not necessarily. He argues that accuracy just isn't as important as the article's emotional impact, which is what stays with readers. Certainly, some of the edits or questions Jim Fingal presents seem downright silly in their supposed thoroughness, but what harm is there in raising them? If an author is more willing to reconsider the more significant factual discrepancies, they'll be dropped. But if he/she decides to be a jerk about every suggestion, the label difficult to work with gets thrown around, the fact checker is inclined to get even more nit picky to ensure complete accuracy, and the relationship is strained. That counts for something in the publishing world. Authors who freak out at every edit come across as sophomoric or, sometimes, dishonest. In an editor's place, I'd be reluctant to commission an article from D'Agata again. There's no need to sacrifice accuracy for word craft.I'm impressed with the courage it took for both writer and fact checker to put their work and their interpersonal conflict on public display and invite all to judge for themselves. The concept of this book is original and interesting. It succeeds in its delivery. If you write nonfiction or edit or care about the accuracy of the articles you read, it's worth your time. Did I really like it, per the GoodReads four-star rating? I'm not sure that's the right descriptor. But it really made me think.",
            "This should be required reading if you want to talk about essays. Unless you think it is a book about fact-checking. In which case: go away. ",
            "Why do you think this was presented as an email exchange? How well would you say this form works in the piece? What important questions do they raise about the nature of truth and creative nonfiction? Who do you side with? Why? What happened in VegasI am a huge fan of the original Believer magazine essay that was turned into this book that was then turned into a Broadway play! What\u2019s not to like? It\u2019s absolutely hilarious.I believe the original exchange was by email, and so they decided just to keep it like that (note below*). And I think it works really well. Both sides can just represent themselves. The temptation would be to make the fact checker into the stooge. But this piece was very nuanced and what you get is two sides of the same coin?Earnest fact-checker tangles with cranky but brilliant writer over journalistic accuracy.Wait, who is writing journalism here? Fact is always stranger than fiction\u2014but creative nonfiction is emotionally the truthiest?The book is great because the original essay from the Believer runs down the middle of the pages with the email exchanges off to both sides. It is a fun read. Here is he original article, which is really well-written!https://believermag.com/what-happens-...In Japanese translation we grapple with similar issues regarding truth and facts. There are even different words to designate literal translations \u76f4\u8a33 versus literary translations \u610f\u8a33Literal translation are factual in the sense that if someone translates the entire text back into the original Japanese, every single word would be accounted for. Also, when you translate company names or any proper nouns, you are supposed to provide a link to show the established translation\u2014this reminded me a lot of his checking things. Of course, you can\u2019t translate poetry like this\u2026 that is more working in meaning and truth. You translate a poem in one language into a poem in the other. Often you read the original, turn it over and make your own truth of what the Japanese says.Both are necessary\u2014but poor John D\u2019Agata\u2014 he is NOT a journalist. And to be required to provide journalistic sources was just so off base\u2026 and funny!Finally as an anecdote. In one of my classes at UCLA, I felt pushed to write a memoir mode first person narrative and so I tried it. But honestly, even though all the facts were there, it was a big lie. An emotional lie. Art \u2014and the artifice of fiction\u2014 can attain truth better sometimes than facts. * From Goodreads:It has since emerged that the quotes we get from Fingal and D'Agata have been edited/selectively chosen/made up wholesale for the sake of this book/etc., thereby beefing up the internal drama of what was more likely a humdrum fact-checking process."

            "BlarghOk, I am so not rehashing this story. Read every other review and you'll get the synopsis you need. If you're Becca, don't read this yet. And I'm leaving out many of my thoughts so you and I can discuss as you read it. My Thoughts1) Sherry Thomas can write like a mo fo. She can create some seriously steamy stuff. She's got an imagination. Get it, girl, you deserve all of the praise you received for this book. But, girl, you do not deserve praise for how you wrapped this sh!te up. Here it is again, Hashtag Nope. You know why? You made Felix do very bad things. And you made Louisa forgive him fairly easily. You even let her help perpetuate his lies. I think we now call those people sociopaths. Just saying. 2) I could not get out of my own head.  So that crap Felix pulled with the handkerchief? Are you #($*ing kidding me (for the second time this morning. Apparently, I am brain dead and lacking review prose)? Asshole doesn't even begin to describe that. Felix is and will always be a manipulative, lying ass. So, why should I be excited that Louisa forgives him. Oh right, because forgiveness is sacred and all that. Yea, I get it and I tend to agree. But you don't forgive sociopaths. Just saying.3) Lastly, I probably should have read this. I don't think I much like Corrie James narration. That's enough for now. "

            "This one was EXTREMELY hard to rate.I have decided on 2.5 and then round it down.The 2 stars are for the heroine.The hero is not really redeemable. And to me he hadn't redeemed himself.The heroine FORGAVE him out of her own goodness, and simply because she had no other option.I mean it was the 1860 or something, what other choices did she have?Divorce was surely not on the card, she was financially dependent on him, her whole family was financially dependent on him and she had no education.However, if divorce was an option, it is my strong belief, she would have divorced him, despite all other shortcoming.She was indeed an extremely strong character.I'll rant about the hero first. This is going to be long! My apologies in advance!1. he was despicable. He had no redeemable quality in my eyes. I do not care about his past. It only makes him appear weaker. It just shows that he learned NOTHING from his mother's mistakes. There is no fool like an old fool. he made the choices knowingly which makes him a disgustingly immoral characterless person, and he was NO hero. from this point forward, I am going to refer to him as Felix.2. He had NO morals, and he grew NO morals. He claimed he married Louisa because he couldn't diminish her character. But that was an out an out lie. he also half lied that he married her because he like her too much, and if he didn't marry her, someone else would have, and he couldn't stand to lose her. that was a also a FULL lie. yes, he couldn't stand to lose her, but he ONLY married her, because Louisa had standards, and morals, and a spine of steel, and she made it crystal clear that the only way he could have her was by marriage. If she agreed to be his mistress, I strongly believe he'd have rejoiced by that acceptance and would have NEVER married her, and would have married someone of equal footing at later date.3. His intentions were never honourable, yet, he never felt the remorse of blackening TWO people's character by suggesting incest and ruining a chance of Louisa's HONOURABLE happiness, which he was NEVER gonna offer. He DID try to blackmail her, which didn't work simply because this heroine, failing to have read HP, and only to have read Jane Austen, had learned how to use her brain and did not give in to blackmail!4. Have you ever been called a slut by a loved one for being attracted to THAT loved one or for performing for your loved one? It could be worse than death. Something does die inside you. The handkerchief scene in the library is enough to write Felix off forever. And why does he do it? BECAUSE OF HIS SHORTCOMING. HE is attracted to his wife, so SHE should pay for it. Excellent logic. He should have died in a ditch somewhere by being kicked by his favourite horse.  I  died a little inside for the heroine. The heroine had lost her sexual urges for quite a while. Now if it was real life, she would have lost it. period. unfortunately it's an OTT book, she gained it back, and used it to her advantage, kudos to her. BUT that scene itself calls for castration. There was NO formal apologies. there was a picnic that she wasn't particularly keen on attending!!!! he needed to grovel on broken glass, or anthill, or both.5. He ruined her life. period. he manipulated the events and she was stuck with him. Not by choice. Louisa may actually have been happier with the OM. We will never know. And he did that for his selfish dishonourable gain.6. Even till the end, NOTHING was for her. As she has pointed out. he did everything for his gain.7. He didn't consider even for a minute that if she agreed to become his mistress, her life would have been ruined, by his doing.8. I really don't see what he did to gain her love OR trust. He hadn't flaunted the OW in front of her, he didn't particularly NOT flaunt the OW in front of her either. He built her a classroom, he wanted a wife his equal, I'm sorry, once again, his gain. Bought her a telescope, wedding present for a compliant wife. Financial security - that's his duty. attention to small details to her family - once again, husbandly duties, specially for a husband who needs to pacify a wife.He did not have a single redeemable or lovable quality in him.Why I liked the heroine:1. She did NOT succumb to blackmail. not even when he used her epileptic sister's love as a bait. He raised a brow. \u201cNot even for dear Matilda?\u201d\u201cDear Matilda would never want me to subject myself to such degradation, especially not for her.\u201d\u201cYou are so sure of her love?\u201d\u201cI am. And if it should be the case that she does not love me enough, then why should I martyr myself for her?\u201dScore!2. She doesn't cry or breaks down in front of him. even after his disgusting insult. She just walks out.3. After she hears the OW propositioning her husband, she is extremely cool and collected. She basically beats him at his own game. after the handkerchief incident, she's void of any emotions, which drove him crazy!This might very well me her:4. She only appears to flirt with the OM, and she beats her husband at his own game, the cold hearted bitch in me wishes she rejected him at that point though, and left him aching!5. She doesn't feel desire for quite a while after being rejected by her husband. She fells exactly how she should, hurt and rejected.6. She doesn't melt whenever he touches her even if she's mad. He THINKS he could do that so he starts kissing her when she's mad, she struggles, and then slaps him and then kicks him out. At no point, does she find herself melting. A resounding thwack. A burning sensation on his cheek.He stared at her in incomprehension.\u201cGet out!\u201d she shouted.\u201cI don\u2019t want you to be angry,\u201d he said dumbly. \u201cYou said that when we are in direct physical contact, you cannot remain angry at me.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t care what you want,\u201d she answered, her teeth gritted. \u201cI deserve to be angry and you do not deserve anything. Now get out.\u201d7. She has no illusions about what he is, and how useless his avowal of love is. all love should meet a minimum standard. A lover should take my wishes into consideration and have a care for my well-being. When have you ever thought about me, except so that you may better gratify yourself\u2014either to make you feel more powerful or to make you feel less out of control? This one was an immensely strong character completely wasted on a characterless rake of a male protagonist. Felix was weak. He was SO weak, he made noseless Voldermort look more appealing! I have zero respect for him, and he was a disgusting excuse of a human being for ruining Louisa's chance of happiness to begin with and then to strip Louisa off her self confidence and liveliness because HE was not man enough. If I could rewrite this, I will kill him off in that ditch so Louisa will be a really rich widow and would be able to live the life she dreamed of!! ",
            "What a fun, fun book!I loved the heroine who was able to turn tables on the hero! Go girl!!!Louisa is almost on the shelf since it has been 8 years that she should have her debut. This is her last chance to find a husband and thus secure the future for her mother and sisters and avoid destitution.She very determined to succede. And she's very clever on how to do it. Nothing is left on chance. She's pianified everything: her behaviour, her look, her prospective husbands, and she carries on very well, even if the choices are not many.Felix, the hero, is a masculine paragon of the ton. He's rich, handsome, successful. Everybody adores him. But... he's cynic. Nothing involves him except his astonomical research. He knows that he has to find a wife, because he needs a heir, but he's not in any rush to do it.They meet by chance and Felix is fascinated by a girl who's not trying to ensare him. More she doesn't consider him at all! How's that possible? Why she's not overwhelmed by his magnificence?Louisa, even if attracted to Felix, knows very well that he's out of her reach and so turns cold shoulder on him. Why wasting time when she has so little of it?The more Louisa tries to ignore him, the more Felix is first fascinated, then attracted to her.And thus a very, very fun banter and even fannier evasion and almost stalkerish tactics between Louisa and Felix! It was delight to read!Louisa is fanstatic! So clever and so level-headed. She makes Felix, who thinks he's so clever, crazy.He makes her a preposterous offer to bacome his mistres!!! But Louisa, instead of becoming enraged and offended, turns the table on him. Finally he offers her marriage and they wed. And here start the problems....Louisa is wary of Felix (with reason!) and Felix is bewildered when he becomes aware that his feeling for Louisa are much deeper than what he thought! So, even if their passion is out-of-charts, he reiterates in fear and wounds Louisa very badly.Louisa, true to herself, doesn't mince words and lashes at him, making him realize that he's almost lost her.This is the part of the story where Felix grovels. And what a groveling it was!!! In true Felix style! Because, for all his faults, he's a very clever and intelligent man!Obviously there's a HEA!A wonderful book, full of clever, intelligent, smart dialogue insterspaces with great internal musings! Very recommended!!!",
            "We often hear about bad boys in romance but we rarely get people who behave *actually shittily* without taking the entire book down with them because the reader exchanges hope of an HEA for hope the bastard steps on Lego forever. This book pulls that off with unbelievable panache. Louisa is an impoverished gentlewoman who needs to marry. Felix is a marquess, born into a hate-filled marriage, rejected by both parents, who has reinvented himself as the perfect gentleman in order to manipulate everyone around him. And he does. He is *nasty* manipulative, attempting to force Louisa by financial pressure into becoming his mistress, using her sexual desire against her, and even when he marries her he does an abrupt withdrawal of affection that is genuinely horrible. The triumph here is that the author has laid down what a badly damaged person he is *but does not use that as an excuse*. We see exactly how hurtful he is through Louisa's eyes, we see the better person he has the capacity to be if he stopped being so self centred, we see his difficulty opening up to her in any other way than sexually, and when the edifice of lies he used to trap her comes crashing down just as he starts believing there could be more in his life, we can share in his feeling of unstoppable nightmare even while thinking he 100% has it coming. What I think works brilliantly is that Louisa isn't particularly altruistic. She's willing to make a marriage of convenience for her family's sake, but not a miserable one. She'll go so far for her husband but no further. Nevertheless the revelation of Felix's misdeeds that pushes her too far is not about how he hurt her but what he did to someone else--and although he then goes into the most magnificent extended attempt at apology and reparations, that isn't what ultimately allows her to move on. It's not about how he behaves *to her*, it's about the person he is, or has become, in general. And that makes all the difference.Basically this is a story about selfishness and the damage it does, and the way that hurt reverberates down the generations. Felix and Louisa are both where they are because of selfish fathers acting out of greed (two on Felix's side) and it's not enough to say women ought to forgive. Men need to do better, and Felix eventually does. A fantastic romance.",
            "This is one of the most fascinating HR I've ever read.It's the story of Louisa Cantwell and Felix Rivendale, and a duel of wits and emotions all the way through the book. The outset is easily explained: Louisa has to marry well in order to keep her family from poverty. Felix is the usual arrogant, cold-hearted and rich aristocrat who has no intention to marry for at least another decade, and then only to secure an heir. Heard it all before? Yup! But this is where the similarities to other HR end. Sherry Thomas has created a story that has no subplot. Nonetheless, every description, every dialogue, every encounter comes with a precision that left me speechless because not one word is wasted. As a child, Felix learns that love is painful and fruitless. He's being used as a weapon by a mother who hates his father. My heart ached for the child who wants nothing but love but is being rejected. So when the time comes he decides to be in total control of his life, his emotions and the people around him. He creates a second persona, The Ideal Gentleman, impeccable, perfect, beyond reproach. To achieve his goals he manipulates and lies if need be. It's fine as long as others don't see his true nature. But he will never be anyones puppet any longer.Now, Louisa...what a woman, what a wonderful character! Knowing she must marry well and sacrifice her own dreams, meticulously plans for years the one season her family can afford for her to catch a rich husband. Like Felix she creates a second persona, the lovely and agreeable young woman who just wants to enjoy a season in London, but she is not beyond manipulation herself. Unlike Felix, though, her family's financial situation leaves her no other option. However, she's no martyr and never behaves as one. There's a dignity and self-respect to her that made me root and cheer for her all the way. You go, girl!Their first encounter is written beautifully. They meet and they see through each other's disguises straight away. Both are not what they appear to be and once both acknowledge it, they don't pretend to be something they're not. He's nowhere near as respectable, and she is anything but the meek, agreeable country chit.It's clear that Louisa is not fooled by The Ideal Gentleman image in any way, but is still drawn to him. Intrigued by this, and by his own growing lust, Felix starts a little game with her and sets out to destroy every hope that Louisa may have in making a good match. And this is where his downfall begins. He underestimates Louisa in every way. Her intelligence, her determination and her passion. However, smart man that he is, he realizes this quickly and now there's no way he will let her get away.Let the fight begin! He wants her as his mistress, she knows that, should she give in, not only would she ruin herself but she fears that he would eventually lose interest in her, and his interest is something that she, despite her resentment, enjoys very much. This is where Sherry Thomas excels. The conflicting feelings and actions, the confusion we see in Louisa as well as in Felix are brilliantly, and most importantly, believably shown.At first, Louisa is lost and angry as to why he has to play his little game with her. She doesn't understand his motivation, nor the rules of the game. But wow...once she gets the hang of it, she turns the tables on him and Felix doesn't know what's hit him. Louisa, oh clever, brilliant Louisa won't give in, but at the same time makes no secret of her lust for him. The sexual tension runs high.There's a little scene that made me grin and cheer and root for Louisa. They are alone in a carriage, both lusting, both confused and fascinated with each other. Smug, little arrogant bastard that Felix is, thinks he has the upper hand, having destroyed almost all her hopes for an advantageous marriage, until she makes it clear that if a marriage to a man of rank and considerable wealth is out of reach, she may very well marry beneath her social status. After all, a butcher or a greengrocer can provide for her family just as well. Felix didn't see this coming at all and it's pure joy to see him thwarted.His fortune privileged him over most other men in London, but how did he compete with all the 'butchers, greengrocers, and the like'? ... His whole plan had depended upon her failure to secure a man of a social station. ... A butcher was an upstanding member of any community.Seeing that he has no other choice if he wants Louisa in his bed, he proposes to her, and she is not stupid enough to reject him. He gets a woman who is intelligent and intriguing and who will never have headaches. Louisa secures her family's future and gets the man she wants and, by now, loves.Their love story is a sweet one. Full of insecurities on both sides, their marriage is wobbly. The conflicts they face are created by themselves and both of them have to face facts they don't like. Due to their conflicting feelings for each other they either retreat or make mistakes, especially Felix. However, because their confusions are put into words so poignantly, I could always relate to both characters. Felix, trying to uphold his control, hurts Louisa deeply, and, although, I could have slapped him for it, I understood why he did it at the same time. Given his backstory, it made sense for someone who had come to understand love as a weakness. Louisa, wounded by his behavior, doesn't crumble or feel sorry for herself. Instead, she makes him pay, and pay he does. Right from the start, she gives as good as she gets, and I admired that.Sherry Thomas has created a wonderful story here, which is intelligent, heart breaking at times and hot. The only quibble I do have is the ending that felt a little rushed, but hey, that's me mourning that I reached the end of the story of Felix and Louisa. And I really, really didn't want to let go.",
            "28 Feb 2021I see that I have now read/listened to this book four times. I suspect that this book is not as highly rated as other Sherry Thomas titles because it is difficult and different from the ordinary histrom. But the writing is so beautiful, the characters are so interesting, and the story is so unusual that it is well worth the reader\u2019s time. * * * * *I chose this book as one of the Best of 2014. Five lucky stars to this clever reworking of the gorgeous, perfect man marrying the impecunious, plain girl. And then falling in love."

            "2014 Re-read:I really love the titles for this series. They\u2019re actually relevant, yet not giving too much away. (Okay, the first one was a rather forced reference, but still.)Anyway, I think this instalment dealt well with a difficult and far-reaching decision for which most paranormal books tend to take the easy way. (I.e. sudden, inexplicable acceptance and a disregard for one\u2019s own life.)The only downside was Bannon\u2019s fit there in the middle when he started to pout like crazy. Understandable but a weird reversal of who he is in the rest of the book. Well, and later he reminds me a lot of all the other \u201calpha males\u201d in the series. (Or at least the friendly ones.) Because yes, we once again have a big guy with a small guy and all the usual stuff associated with that.And the book being set up will work the same way, alas. (I have some uncomfortable memories of that one since Torren really is a jerk, but we\u2019ll see how it reads.)Good book that tells an actual story. I do appreciate that the back-story in this series really does feel more cohesive and important than in most other paranormal fluff, without ever going off focus for the main couple of the relevant book. No cheating by adding other viewpoints. Excellent.2012 Review:This went back to the original mould of little guy and big guy with all that typically entails, but I liked it anyway. It explored another aspect of the fated mates theme.To my awed surprise I find myself really liking these books. The characters, even if some of them are repetitive, and the way the ongoing plot is woven into each book without ever really taking over. We always get to see the bits that matter to the protagonists and nothing more than that. A lot is left shrouded in mystery, in fact. This way there\u2019s no sense of exposition being dumped (for the most part, anyway) and no irrelevant information is pushed on us.I wonder who the next book will deal with. The possibilities at this point are fairly varied and I am interested in all of them. Even if I have a hunch that the one guy I liked in this volume may not turn out as interesting in his own book as he was in preview. This happens a lot, though, and even with that caveat I should get some enjoyment out of it. :D",
            "typical gabrielle evans serial romance. nothing fantastic, nothing so bad it can't be finished. what is typical gabrielle evans? imagine a shorter harlequin romance but with no t&amp,a (see, i was going to write no surprise pregnancies, but... yeah.). out of sheer laziness, i will be using this as my template for all books by :sunny daylynn hagenstormy glennscarlett hyacinthcarol lynnegabrielle evansunless otherwise noted. i'd apologize, but i'm not sorry. i figure it's about as much time as they put into their books. dammit! well, i made it all the way to the end being rather moderate in my assessment. that's a win.

            "For some reason I feel like I missed a book. The book itself was fun. The characters engaging. I just didn't get into it though. There was just too much waffle with Galen and pressure but not with Bannon. I just don't know. It was just something that wasn't there. I'm bad at figuring out what but it just seemed...blah."

            "Originally posted at: http://whippedcream2.blogspot.com/201...With shifters, vampires, witches and more, this story really kept me on the edge of my seat.Bannon exudes self-confidence, now if he can just give some of that confidence to his mate, Galen, he may be able to capture the forever after he's always dreamed of. Bannon is a sexy Irishman I would love to have covering my back. His character just made me feel protected even as a reader. I could tell he would do anything to keep those he cared for safe, including his reluctant mate. I also love a man with an accent so this story was perfectly written to show his Irish heritage and made me want more.In the beginning of the story, I was a bit confused by the secondary characters. There seemed to be so many of them populating the scenes I had a hard time differentiating between them. I think this is partially because I have not read previous stories in this series. Had I been more familiar with the series I am sure I would have appreciated these cameos.The subplot of the story was as entertaining as the romantic development. I enjoyed learning about Bannon and Galen\u2019s individual abilities and how they helped protect those they loved. I would have liked to have seen Galen\u2019s \u201cshifter\u201d blood play a bit more of a role, however. The conflict added a bit of edge to help push the characters along nicely. While danger was lurking at every corner, Bannon and Galen also found time to just have fun and enjoy one another. The good times mixed in with the danger made me appreciate the main characters more. It also gave me an indication that their relationship would last throughout the ages. ",
            "It's been so long since I read the earlier books that I couldn't remember everything that had happened in them but enough came back as I read to help me through the story. This was an enjoyable read. It didn't really stand out for me as a particularly special story but I enjoyed the interaction between Galen and Bannon. I liked Galen's feisty nature and the way he was able to overcome his past and trust in his future with Bannon. As usual, there was some set up story for the mate pairings to come in future books and it was enough to persuade me to continue on with the series.",
            "Another fun and entertaining addition to the series. It was a nice twist that Galen wanted Bannon but didn't believe in fated mates or that he was more than a simple human. Ms. Evans did a nice job showing Bannon's frustration in his untrusting mate. It was also nice seeing so many of the characters from the previous releases. It gave the book a nice sense of of warmth and family. There's plenty of action near the end and Galen coming to the rescue of Bannon and the others was totally unexpected. There are several thread left dangling but I assume those will be dealt with in the future. ",
            "Sweet fluffy read, not much drama, favorite type of MC's. Noted one reviewer mentioned that shifter can only mate shifter but the previous book mated two shifters and a vampire. I have to say it's been a long time since I read the last installment and I did miss that. Makes you wonder. Still I liked it for the easy, romantic read."

            "This book was an impulse buy from Wal-Mart (30% off books\u2019 cover prices, woohoo!), but I\u2019m so glad I did it because I fell in love with it! What interested me was the fact that it took place in 1860\u2032s Russia. I am really enjoying European historical fiction lately, particularly the 1500-1800s, so when I saw this book, I knew I wanted it right away. It was a bit risky since I didn\u2019t know anything about the author and it is such a new book that there are hardly any reviews on it on Goodreads, but I took the chance and it turned out to be an amazing read.The story takes place in 1860s Russia, under the reign of Tsar Alexander II. Russia is experiencing a social revolution during this time period thanks to the Emancipation Reform of 1861, which meant that many serfs were allowed their freedom and granted the rights of a full citizen of Russia.The entire novel revolves around this one event: the Count and Countess of Angelkov\u2019s son is kidnapped from them by their ex-serfs (though they don\u2019t know who did it for a while, they thought it was the Cossacks). Even though serfdom was abolished, many were still landless, poor peasants and their situation did not improve one bit, many harbored resentment towards their former masters and now acted on their feelings. Antonina, the Countess, slowly spirals into despair, becoming an alcoholic. The Count falls ill and becomes of no use to Antonina and the entire estate slowly heads toward bankruptcy. Other characters include Lilya, Antonina\u2019s maid who is in love with Antonina and is jealous of anyone who seems to have her mistress\u2019 affections, Grisha, the steward of the estate who regrets being involved with the kidnapping scheme greatly, and Valentin, an attractive and talented violinist who befriends the Countess during her time of crisis.A great chunk of the book is devoted to exploring the back stories of each of the main characters. At first I felt a bit like the story was a tad disjointed because there is such a significant amount of writing devoted to explaining each character and how they came to live at Angelkov, so soon after the beginning. I suppose what I wanted was for the back stories to blend in with the story a little better: it felt like the book consisted of \u201ckidnapping (50 pages) \u2014 backstories (200 pages) \u2014 resume kidnapping story (200 pages)\u201d. However, each character has a very interesting story so it was a pleasant detour, if you can call it that. Actually, as I continued reading, I realized this book isn\u2019t really about the kidnapping \u2014 it\u2019s about the characters, and so, the so-called \u201cdetour\u201d is actually vital to the story.Even though I wanted the book to go back to the kidnapping story, I was not unhappy with reading about the individual characters\u2019 pasts. Each one is so fascinating and it was really great to read about how the Emancipation Reform affected everyone on all levels. Freeing the serfs sounds great on paper, but many of them don\u2019t feel any difference in their situation since they have no land or money anyway. They\u2019ll have to just keep working for their master anyway. For the nobles, they begin to lose so many serfs that they can\u2019t keep all their land, especially with the high land taxes the tsar has set, so they end up having to give away pieces of land anyway, and downsizing a lot. This book was such a great way for me to learn about this time period. Even though it is all fictional, its point is the unrest that followed such a social revolution affects everyone, and nobody comes out as a clear winner or loser.The kidnapping is obviously what this whole novel revolves around, even though I didn\u2019t feel like it was the focal point. The kidnapping felt more like the background on which all the characters are introduced to the reader. This is more of a character driven story, which I am usually not the biggest fan of (I\u2019m very 50/50 on such stories), but this one had me sucked in and I was up reading this book until the wee hours of the morning. Of course, the kidnapping did provide a very exciting element to the story. The whole time I wondered if Antonina would get her son back or not, if she would ever be reunited with him. So even though this is a character driven story, I think it can be rather plot driven as well!I highly recommend this book, it\u2019s a great novel and I felt it was written in a very engaging and easy-to-read manner. Such a great book!",
            "An absorbing tale of upheaval and social change in Russian in the 1860s. I liked the way that pieces of music were used throughout to evoke particular moments in history and in the plot. Linda Holeman never disappoints and I'm waiting for the next one from this author.",
            "The second half of the nineteenth century was a creative time of change and turmoil in Russia, with powerful writing, the freeing of the serfs and the rise of a flourishing musical culture. Yet for many of the women and men caught up in these years, upheaval could bring huge uncertainties and social tensions. Linda Holeman traces the impact of such change in a large rural estate, Angelkov, many miles away from the governing circles in St. Petersburg and Moscow.This is a solid novel, like others Holeman has written, with vivid characters and a strong plot line, all drawn together on the basis of first-hand research and well-written prose. The start of the novel is especially powerful -- three horsemen ride out of the woods, violently assault the Count of the estate, and kidnap his 10-year-old son. That sets off the main plot-line of the book -- can the child be retrieved and why has he been taken? That, in turn, takes us to his mother, the young Countess, who is devastated -- and whose history is traced, providing much insight, and connecting to a young serf woman who became her friend and then was exiled for having such social contact. Lilya, in turn, provides insight into serf life. The story then revolves to a great extent around the mother and the tragedy that unfolds for her as the kidnap process continues. Lilya plays a key role in the resolution of the plot, as does Grisha, the steward of the estate.Beyond this fundamental plot, there is also much in this book about music, particularly composer Mikhail Glinka, and the serf orchestras that existed in mid-century Russia. For some readers, there may also be a bit too much melodrama in this book. But this weakness is overshadowed for me by the interesting social commentary that Holeman provides on the Russia of a particularly significant time.",
            "More like 3.5 stars.I wish I could've liked this book better. It's a historical novel about Russia, specifically the period following the emanicipation of the serfs in the 1860s, it's well-thought out, it definitely immerses you in a different time and place and all but one of the characters are compelling. Except that one character is a biggie. It's the heroine.SPOILERS AHEAD: The 10-year-old son of Antonina Mitlovsky is kidnapped off the estate (named Angelkov)at the start of the story, so she drinks vodka. Actually she's already drinking because she's sad about something. Her husband falls seriously ill shortly thereafter, so she drinks. Further on, she has a one-night stand, feels guilty and--guess what--drinks. As her woes pile up, she swills back more vodka and then looks beseechingly at her steward, Whatever shall I do? Scarlett O'Hara brandishing carrots, she ain't.Okay, it's easy to be nasty, so I'll stop. Well, one other thing. A 'verst' is a Russian unit of length, equivalent to a kilometre. It is NOT a measure of area. The steward cannot own 12 versts of land. The estate is not thousands of versts in size. Desiastina (2.7 acres)is the unit for area. Okay, rant done.I'm reminded of historical romance author Mary Balogh who urged writers to get their facts straight. 'Because if you don't, you'll be told.' (paraphrasing) I guess this is one of those times, Ms. Holeman."

        "desc": "Around the world communities that have suffered the trauma of unspeakable violence--in Liberia, Somalia, West Africa, Columbia, and elsewhere--are struggling to recover and reconcile, searching for ways not just to survive but to heal.,In ,When Blood and Bones Cry Out,, John Paul Lederach, a pioneer of peace-building, and his daughter, Angela Jill Lederach, show how communities can recover and reconnect through the power of making music, creating metaphors, and telling their extraordinary stories of suffering and survival. Instead of relying on more common linear explanations of healing and reconciliation, the Lederachs demonstrate how healing is circular, dynamic, and continuing, even in the midst of ongoing violence. They explore the concept of social healing, a profoundly important intermediary step between active warfare and reconciliation. Social healing focuses on the lived experience of those who have suffered protracted violence and their need to give voice to that experience, both individually and collectively. Giving voice, speaking the unspeakable, in words and sounds that echo throughout traumatized communities, can have enormous healing power. Indeed, the Lederachs stress the remarkable effects of sound and vibration through tales of Tibetan singing bowls, Van Morrison's transcendent lyrics, the voices of mothers in West Africa, and their own personal journeys. And they include inspiring stories of transformation: a mass women's protest movement in Liberia that forces leaders to keep negotiating until a peace agreement is signed; elders in Somalia who walk between warring clans year after year to encourage dialogue; former child soldiers who run drum workshops and grow gardens in refugee camps; and rape victims in Sierra Leone who express their pain in poetry.,With equal measures of insight and compassion, ,When Blood and Bones Cry Out, offers a promising new approach to healing traumatized communities.",

No action, no passion or romance, no passing of secrets to the nazi, nothing travel related (would\u2019ve at least appreciated something about the beautiful Sintra!!).

            "This beautifully-illustrated retelling of an ancient folktale concerning Saint Brigid of Kildare, one of Ireland's patron saints, contains a fascinating blend of Pagan Celtic and early Christian motifs. From the old Druid who gives the infant Brigid a beautiful blue cloak, and who speaks with a voice wise and fierce and full of truth, to the Holy Family in Bethlehem, who somehow seem to exist outside of time, and know Brigid for who she is (a child of the West), this story has just the right mixture of magic and spirituality to appeal to young readers, whatever their religious persuasion. The color illustrations by English artist Helen Cann are vibrant and appealing. I was pleased, moreover, to see the the explanatory notes in the back, giving some historical background to the story.",
            "This is one of my favorite books about a saint. It manages to tell the rather fantastical story in a way that seems true enough and keeps the attention even of the littlest listeners. I was most impressed by the inclusion of the Druid's blessing at the beginning of the story. A good saint tale that doesn't whitewash the sense of myth out of the retelling.",
            "This beautifully designed storybook tells readers a lovely tale about the Irish lass that would grow up to be St.Brigid. I told the story using the pictures more than the text.",
            "This is a sweetly told and beautifully illustrated legend from the childhood of St. Brigid of Ireland, whose stories create a bridge between the Old Ways and the Christianity that was newly arriving in Ireland when she lived. In the book we see a Druid treated with respect and reverence as a divine messenger, and also see 10-year-old Brigid magically transported in time to witness and assist at the birth of Jesus. For those interested in bridging these traditions in our own families, this is a great resource.",
            "A marvelous book about a most beloved catholic saint and her majestic blue cloak. ",
            "About the legend of the Irish saint Brigid whose feast day is February 1st.",
            "There's a really lovely reading of this on youtube, which is where I found it looking for ways to celebrate St Brigid's Day. Imagine there are many variations on this tale. Love how this story mixes St Brigid's story with druid times, nativity legends, and the fact that Brigid herself was born into slavery. Somewhere I have an old Puffin copy of Patricia Lynch's Knights of God-- will pull it out for my daughter who has chosen Brigid for her confirmation name. Knights of God has stories of Brigid, Patrick, Enda, Ciaran, Kevin and others. Also looking for beautiful books on St Francis. Of Assisi, but interested in all the Francises (I love the words of St Francis de Sales). "

            "Warlord continues the saga of Alan Dale from just about where King's Man leaves the story. Alan is in France, serving King Richard III in the seemingly never ending brutal wars against the French.I struggle with how to evaluate this book. There is much to like. The history buff in me very much appreciates the inside look at the campaigns of Richard. That's why I read historical fiction. It's kind of like a front row seat into history. It brings it to life and makes it fun. Warlord (and this whole series) nails that. The problem with Warlord is not capturing the feel of the age. The problem is ... elsewhere. Alan is on a quest to find the man who directly led to his father's hanging. This quest has many twists and turns and takes him across war-ravaged northern France. I just didn't care. This story line just didn't engage me for some reason. I can't really put my finger on why. There was, frankly, a long stretch in the middle of the book where I was bored. Far more interesting, in my opinion, was the relationship between Alan and his betrothed, Goody. About 2/3rds of the way through the book Alan is injured and returns to England. Here he is re-united with Goody, but this reunion is spoiled by Nur, the disfigured Arab woman. It turns out that this crone has gathered a host of outcast women about her and they are focused on a terrible curse they have placed on Alan and Goody. This is great stuff and had me on the edge of my seat for large stretches. It also helped that the relationship and emotions of the couple humanized and fleshed out the characters more. I wish that this storyline had been more developed rather than the Alan's quest. A solid three stars. It was good, but not great. The last third of the book saved it from two stars. ",
            "ReviewWhen i first started this series it was with a touch of eagerness, and a fair bit of trepidation. Robin Hood has always been a personal favourite of mine (i do share the name after all). I have read quite a few failed attempts at writing this great character, and seen some blooming awful films.By the end of that 1st book i was amazed by the astounding piece of work that Angus had produced, so new and so fresh and so real.The wait for books 2 (Holy Warrior) and 3 Kings Man was eternal for some one who loves Historical fiction, and I'm sure he didn't mind the hundreds of reminders to get the heck on with it.So how did book 4 Warlord match up to its predecessors?Its better, every book has got better than the last, yet this one takes a large leap froward in excellence. The writing and the plot as ever is realistic, dark, violent, dirty, visceral so many words. Its like opening a portal on the past and a more realistic past that the fanciful and simple rob the rich to feed the poor. As usual Sir Alan Dale is the true star of the show, for any book you need to be able to relate to some degree with a character and Robin is just too much of a git to truly do that. A charismatic git a dramatic git a medieval Don Corleone of a loveable git. But Alan is the true multi-dimensional character the one you can see yourself in.Earlier this year i said Christian Cameron's God of War would be my book of the year for 2012. This book damn near proved me wrong. I do now have 2 books of the year, because i really cannot separate them. The Outlaw Chronicles is fast becoming one of my all time favourite series.VERY Highly recommended.(Parm)Book DescriptionMay 1194. Finally released from captivity, Richard the Lionheart is in Normandy engaged in a bloody war to drive the French out of his continental patrimony. Using the brutal tactics of medieval warfare - siege, savagery and scorched earth - the Lionheart is gradually pushing back the forces of King Philip of France.

",
            " Not my favorite of the series, but I love the characters and the author pulled some nice surprises. ",
            "If you hunger for bigger battles after the seige of Nottingham Castle and the battles in the Holy Land from previous books Warlord provides what it says on the tin - WAR over quite a good number of years including the odd seige of a castle or two or maybe three.This book shifts its focus ever so slightly from Alan's adventures with Robin (although he hasn't completely taken a back seat in this tale) to Alan's adventures as a loyal and supportive Knight under the leadership of none other than Richard the Lion Heart himself. And yets as an extra bonus Alan has a family murder mystery to solve inspired from his last meeting with the now at long last dead Sir Murdac AND the psychotic and disfigured Nur is still haunting the lands around Westbury. So as you can see there is A HECK OF A LOT for Alan to deal with besides just surviving one battle around Normandy from the next.There isn't ever a slow period, a peaceful season or a respite for Alan as he has challenges both personal and private to deal with whether he's at home with the ever reliable Goody or abroad amongst his fellow Knights.This book is quite an eye opener mixed in with a history lesson for most people probably know the Lion Heart best for his failed campaigns into the Holy Land. But what Angus Donald reveals in this telling is a glimpse into what the Lionheart did next as he began years of sieges and battles to reclaim his lands lost to King Philip of France. A campaign I dare say he proved more successful that is until....well I won't spoil it.However I will say that woven within the latter half of this epic tale is a secret that could change a lot of lives for better or for worse if discovered and claimed by Robin and his men - and that dear reader is where Angus Donald cunningly leads you into the next book in the series.Over all a roller coaster of a read - each chapter grips you by the collar and drags you through Alan's many trials and tribulations and will leave you gasping for breath at the end but also craving more. A superb piece of historical fiction written with a human heart, soul and mind at the centre of it all that gives this story such power over the reader that they are gripped even when there isn't a sword clashing with a shield or an arrow being fired from a castle keep.",
            "This is the fourth in the excellent \u201cOutlaw\u201d series, the story of Robin Hood and Richard the Lionheart through the eyes of Alan Dale. The focus in this one is mainly King Richard\u2019s campaign in France against King Philip and the author blends the historical fact of Richard\u2019s campaign with the fiction of Robin Hood and his men supporting the campaign. Oh, and for additional fun the Holy Grail is chucked in.Angus Donald sets up Alan Dale as the nice guy conflicted by his affection and support for Robin and Richard and the dark places that takes him. Robin is a key but peripheral character (as is Richard) in this story, where we see Alan following up the mystery of his father\u2019s death and his father\u2019s youth. Alan himself is keen, slightly na\u00efve and quite young, but this is a good contrast to those with hidden agendas and a darker side. And this must include Robin Hood, again brilliantly portrayed as multi-layered and with a distinct dark side.King Richard\u2019s campaign in 1194 (ish) was very much that of mediaeval tradition, that of siege and destruction, ransom and an odd blend of nobility and savagery. The author does an excellent job of blending a bit of history with the fictional activities of his characters. As with the previous books this is well written, well researched and very well delivered. I think the whole series has been a brilliant take on the \u2018Robin Hood\u2019 era, and making Hood a peripheral and dark character was a stroke of genius.Historical fun and action at it\u2019s best.",
            "The fourth in Angus Donald's Outlaw series and my least favourite so far. The problem with WARLORD is that it feels like the author was really struggling when he wrote this book. The whole siege warfare scenario that plays out in France is slightly repetitive and it feels a little staged, there's no real beginning or end to it, it just goes on and on. Donald has found a formula here and he's sticking to it, which makes it ever so slightly dull.Now, I'm not saying that this isn't entertaining to read, because it is. On a superficial level at least. Donald's writing is extremely readable and the battle sequences come thick and fast, with plenty of bloodshed and gore to enliven them. It's the bigger picture that's lacking. The characterisation is noticeably lacking here, all of the characters end up in exactly the same place as they were when they started out, except for those supporting ones who've been bumped off, of course.My next problem is that this novel is overlong and it does drag in places. The whole return to England sub-plot with the return of the tiresome Nur feels like it belongs in a different book and it really drags everything down, particularly as nothing happens. And the stuff about the Holy Grail just feels like a set-up for the next book in the series (GRAIL KNIGHT). In other hands, I might have enjoyed WARLORD more, but because I know Donald's capable of much, much better (as with the first three books in this series) I just couldn't love it as much as I did the others. Let's hope he picks up the ball again with the next one.",
            "The fourth book in Angus Donald's Outlaw series, this one is primarily set in and around the last years of Richard I (The Lionheart) reign, leading up to his death on 06/04/1199 after being struck in the shoulder by a crossbow bolt fired from a castle he was besieging in Southern France.Like the previous three books in the series, this is presented as an elderly Alan Dale recounting the adventures of his youth, with each section (and the epilogue) of the novel as him committing the tale to paper, and his thoughts in so doing.While the cover of the novel also has A Robin Hood tale above the title, I actually found that character to be sidelined more in favour of Alan in this novel than in the previous, where he very much was central to the story but seemingly not so much here. That's not to mean that he's not present, and that he doesn't have a role to play: just that this novel is more about Richard than it is Robin.The novel also includes elements form that other great Medieval tale/obsession of the Holy Grail, which is worked into the reason why Richard is besieging the castle (at Robin's urgings) at which he receives his fatal wound. That plot strand, however, is also left wide-open for the sequel, already announced as titled Grail Knight, and which I'm already looking forward to!"

            "MacDonald\u2019s The Historical Atlas of the Civil War proved to be one of the most disappointing purchases in a long time. At its very best, the book is a rehash of material which can be found in many far better books. Unfortunately, its \u201cbest\u201d is sprinkled rather sparsely throughout the book. The book has many, many problems.The individual chapters are short (if articles with as few as two pages can be glorified with the term \u201cchapter\u201d, and rarely with the equivalent of three full pages of text), often poorly organized (a problem with the layout of the book itself, too), and have a writing style which reminded me of high school history papers I once had to help grade, with rambling subjects, and text included which had little or nothing to do with the chapter subject.Too many chapters appear to loose their focus. For example, Lines of Communication (p. 88) starts with the railroads and the superiority of the North in this area (although looking at the map on page 89 would seem to indicate better Southern railroads in the east - a seriously false impression). It abruptly jumps to the subject of balloons, which while a significant topic, has nothing to do with national lines of communication. Then, since balloons used telegraphs to communicate with the ground, the chapter spends one large and two small paragraphs on the use of the telegraph - one of the most significant technologies in the war and a major part of the Lines of Communication.Numerous grammatical errors, which often seriously detract from the reading experience, make one wonder if any editor every seriously looked at the book before it was published. Examples abound, but a typical one is on page 111, in the caption to the drawing of Earl Van Dorn. \u201cInstead he was given command of a cavalry in 1863.\u201d A cavalry what? That is not a complete sentence. Worse, this exact error is repeated a number of times.Map and picture captions offer a plethora of errors and further suggest a lack of pre-publishing review. On pages 112 and 113 are maps whose captions describe depictions of Confederate strategic control over Missouri and northwest Arkansas. Actually, the maps are of the Battle of Pea Ridge and the Battle of Prairie Grove. Further, on page 110 a caption indicates that the associated drawing is \u201cThe official battle flag of the Confederate States \u2026\u201d But, the drawing is of what appears to be Union troops charging some routing Confederates. The only flags in the drawing are two Stars and Stripes. We might also note, to correct the facts, that there never was an \u201cofficial\u201d Confederate battle flag, despite what many people think and the book at indicates. In the Confederacy battle flags were adopted by generals in the field, not by the government, and although what is currently called a \u201cConfederate battle flag\u201d was used, it was never a standard or official beyond the units which carried it. Undoubtedly my favorite caption is on page 129, above a picture of the crew of the Monitor, \u201cNear the porthole are the dents made by the guns of the Union craft.\u201d One wonders exactly which Union craft were firing with such effectiveness on the Monitor during the battle of Hampton Roads.Finally (and this could go one quite a while), we also find a bit of self-serving inconsistency in the presentation of some of his points. For example, in an effort to make the writings of Carl von Clausewitz more relevant to the war (not wrong, but certainly questionable as written), we find the following statement on page 94, \u201cEven General Grant, who suffered 61,000 casualties in his Virginia campaign of 1864-65 ... turned more and more to flanking maneuvers as the casualties mounted\u201d. The implication that Clausewitz is the primary source for Civil War generals learning to use flanking maneuvers is just plain silly. Further, the implication, that it was not until 1864 that Grant began to use such maneuvers is flat out false, as the author himself discusses on page 119, noting that Grant began using flanking maneuvers against Forts Henry and Donelson (1862) and continued to do so throughout the war.This is not a good book. It is not a well written book. It is not a well edited book. These problems might be forgivable if the book actually offered something new or presented the material in a manner which explained things better, but it doesn\u2019t. I got my copy from the Reduced Price Books section of a Barns &amp, Noble store. Despite this, I paid way too much for what I got."

            "Short little book so short little review. Perhaps this one has something for everyone or not. Basic plot: Hispanic boy who is HIV positive is injured when a letter-jacket wearing assailant takes a baseball bat to his car (and probably would have done the same to him had he not driven away) which is witnesses by a girl with Down syndrome and blamed on a white football player boy who's been harassing the Hispanic boy about having HIV. Got all that?The story is told from the various viewpoints, Alex(HIV), Daria(Ds) and Clinton(bully extraordinaire) and I think the different voices works because you get the thoughts and feelings of each of them except that Daria's voice is only bits of free verse, not quite sure what the author is trying to say with that and it bothered me. There is growth from the characters, well, from the boys and some needed self-awareness from them also.My one real complaint is that the story feels very dated. It was published in 2005, but the stupidity of Clinton about AIDS reads like mid-eighties or perhaps early nineties. He doesn't want to sit next to Alex or that his sister is friends with Alex's sister and he makes sure Alex knows it, in an anonymous and cowardly way however. The book has a timeline starting out with a dated police report which has the date, but not year. I thought this was odd as I would think a police report would definitely include the year and it would have grounded the story in a certain time. I don't quite understand that omission. So that brought the story down a bit for me because I hope that people today, school administrators as well as students(and well, everyone) are somewhat better informed about this disease. I did enjoy the writing style and the character's voices and I'd more than likely read this author again.",

            "There are not a lot of Young Adult novel with the theme of HIV/AIDS. The new releases on the subject are just a handful each year, but each book published is a new adventure. From the few I have read and the others I have browsed, none are the same, and they all offer something different. Alex Flinn's Fade To Black is no exception and draws a bigger picture around people deemed different. The story is told through three different perspectives. From the point of view of the victim, Alex Crusan first, an HIV-positive teenager whose car has been shattered by a baseball bat while he was in the car. From the point of view of the witness, Daria a teenage girl with Down Syndrome who goes to the same school as Alex. And finally, from the point of view of Clinton, the guy who doesn't hide he has a problem with Alex at school, the guy who was seen next to the crime location the morning it took place.~~Fade To Black is an absolutely unique and beautiful story. Told in three conflicting point of views, it shows how different truth can be. Alex Flinn got into the head of both Alex and Daria in a way that will stay with you. Not because you see how they are inside, but because you see, through their eyes, how they are seen by others. They are both not like other kids and are looked as such. Alex explains how other teenagers avert their eyes when they cross him in the school corridors because they don't want him to feel as if they are staring at him and they don't want him to think they are judging him. Alex sees this and thinks it's sometimes worse than someone directly in conflict with him, because at least they interact with him. Even though the other teenagers don't judge him, they don't try to make friends with him either and Alex explains how lonely he feels all the time. It changes from the black and white conceptions of people who are against people with AIDS are evil or HIV positive people should be quarantined. That's why he relates to Daria who has no friends at school either. The passages in Clinton's head were the most interesting part to read and I thought the combination of the three perspectives was just so fascinating. When you look at Clinton from the outside, you think he is one of those intolerant self-righteous idiots who can't bear anyone else with a difference. On the inside, it is another story entirely. Other than reading about him being bullied and really loving and caring about his younger sister, you read about someone who acts in sync with his ideas. Don't get me wrong, I am not saying he is right when he wants to change seats in class because he is sitting next to Alex, on the contrary. But his attitude comes mainly from his ignorance of the virus. His fear of HIV is more important than his hate for Alex. I thought it was an interesting point of view to observe. One of the major themes is bullying and more particularly how teenagers reject others who don't fit in the right mould. A minority might be violent or insulting, but the worse is the silent majority feigning not to notice, and not trying to include them. Daria and Alex both talk of how invisible they feel. The other major theme is family. Without going in too much details, I think that Alex Flinn had the tremendous talent to really go inside the head of those teenagers and show how they interact with their parents. One of the most important aspect I keep noticing in YA literature is how parents fail to understand what is going on in their children's heads. The conflict between Alex and his overprotective mother was quite interesting to read from Alex's point of view, same goes for Daria and Clinton's relations with their respective mothers.Alex is HIV positive, and as you may know (or not, though you can read my Sunday post (here) if you haven't), he carries the virus but it hasn't completely overtaken his immune system. The book was written in 2005, and it changes from the first wave of YA books written in the 1980s/90s at the early stages of the epidemics. I found it interesting how people's opinion of HIV-positive people differs depending on how the virus was contracted. If it was through a transfusion, it is a tragedy, if it was through drugs or sex it makes the person filthy and they (nearly) deserve their fate. This story is absolutely beautiful and helps you get inside the head of someone who is HIV positive, as well as someone with Down Syndrome. Alex Flinn's writing is simply perfect. She really gets into the head of these three teenagers and brings us a fascinating story. In very simple words and powerful ideas, we get our own conceptions thrown back at us and we just realise how much more beautiful the world is with all its shades of grey.I cannot recommend this book enough as it a fascinating YA novel for people wanting to know more about HIV, but also about major issues teenagers encounter such as bullying or the relationship they have with their families.",
            "My 9th graders will love this book. Crisp writing and a simple, poignant plot. Even though there are multiple perspectives (a witness, the victim, and a suspect), my students will find it easy to follow the shifts. I like that it addresses the topic of what it means to be HIV positive in a realm other than the world of homosexuality where my students expect it.",
            "The book Fade to Black by Alex Flinn is written in three \u201ccharacters\u201d perspectives. The main being Alex Flinn who is HIV positive and he goes to a small town school where everyone knows that he has HIV. Alex was in his car when he was attacked by a guy with a baseball bat. The guy shattered his windshield as Alex hid under the steering wheel. But the broken glass still cut alex as it was flying through the air. The only eye witness is a girl named Daria and she has Down Syndrome and believes the attacker was a guy named Clinton Cole. Clinton cole bullies Alex and wants him to leave the school because he has aids but says he did not break the windshield. I thought this was a great book and a great awareness bullying. It would be a great read for just about anyone that likes a good thrill with a good meaning to it.",
            "25 April 2005 FADE TO BLACK by Alex Flinn, Harper Tempest, April 2005, ISBN: 0-06-056839-9, LIB ISBN: 0-06-056841-0 One evening later this week Brook Haven Middle School will host its annual Open House. I spent a day in Shari's classroom late last week working hard to clean up the disaster zone in preparation for the occasion. Shari is the school's drama teacher as well as one of the eighth-grade English teachers. Her drama students are notorious for leaving their thrift store purchased costuming and props in the classroom long after the performances are all complete. I filled four huge cartons to overflowing with those items that we're not likely to need for future productions. They went to the lost and found. A couple of cartons of the good stuff went into the prop room. You would think that an English classroom should have a collection of some decent books in it, but Shari and I sort of go to extremes. Fortunately, I had brought a bunch of paper bags with me. I filled nine of them with old ARCs (advance reader copies) that I no longer cared about owning. A coordinator at juvenile hall will collect them in a couple of days and they'll get a whole new life. As I collected and neatly stacked the classroom sets of books (SPEAK, THE LAND, THE MISFITS, WITNESS, THE LAST BOOK IN THE UNIVERSE, LEFT FOR DEAD, 19 VARIETIES OF GAZELLE, BRONX MASQUERADE, etc.), and filled those shopping bags for juvenile hall, and filled a shelf in the office with the latest paperback purchases and 2005 ARCs, I also accumulated a very small pile of books to take back home. (Like coals to Newcastle! someone knowledgeable of our home might exclaim.) A few were ARCs of books that had gone on to win major awards. A couple were Richie's Picks titles that I wanted to have an extra copy of for booktalks. And I grabbed my copy of MORE THAN WORDS: THE SPEECHES OF MARIO CUOMO, which I used to delve into occasionally for inspiring patriotic observances. Two ARCs on that stack for home were literally falling apart. One was Brenda Woods' EMAKO BLUE, which we just bought a new copy of for the classroom. It's been passed nonstop from kid to kid for a year now. The other, which from overuse is now a collection of loose pages nested in a cover, is Alex Flinn's FADE TO BLACK. Finally getting my own chance to read it last night, I had to grip it with two hands so that it wouldn't fall all over the room. Night is when I think about dying. That's what I'm doing now, after midnight in the quiet hospital. It didn't take long to see why Shari's students have been enthusiastically turning each other on to FADE TO BLACK since its arrival in the classroom in January. Central to the story is a hate crime involving a baseball bat and the shattered windows of an occupied automobile. There is a victim, Alex Crusan, a HIV-positive high school student whose family recently moved from Miami to the small town of Pinedale. There is a witness, Daria, a fellow high school student with Down Syndrome. Then there is a football player, also from Pinedale High, Clinton Cole. We learn quickly from Clinton himself that he'd thrown a rock through a window of the Crusan house the night before. Did Clinton also, as Daria tells police, attack Alex's car when Alex was stopped at a red light early on the morning of October 27th? What Alex Flinn does so well here is to create three realistic and complex teen characters, all of whom have some secrets. She also writes so articulately about the elephant in the room: the continued fear and ignorance in America surrounding HIV and AIDS.  'They told us before he came here that you couldn't get sick, just being near him. But I don't believe it for a minute. I mean, what if he cuts himself? He doesn't have those purple, blotchy things you always see on people with AIDS on TV. But still, there's all these molecules and particles and things, junk in the air. And what about dust mites?' I remember once, they told us in science class that dust is all people's skin and junk. Excuse me, but I don't want that guy's skin particles on me.  In an exceptional article, How a Young Adult Novelist Researches, published in VOYA and accessible online at http://pdfs.voya.com/VO/YA2/VOYA20041... , Alex discusses a 2003 Minnesota AIDS Project study in which researchers found that 43 percent of those surveyed did not know or were uncertain about whether HIV could be transmitted through a cough or a sneeze, and 38 percent did not know or were uncertain whether it could be transmitted from a toilet seat. Having done her homework, the author creates a consistent tone throughout the book that is revealing of the myths and the reality and how students are affected by them. All the daysafter,he said hijust hiand Iliked him. Alex Flinn has been steadily gaining a reputation among adolescents for creating high interest, realistic YA fiction that incorporates issues that matter to them. FADE TO BLACK will continue the spread of that reputation. I've got a dismantled ARC as testimony of that.

            "While there aren't a lot of young adult books about a HIV-positive teenager, I felt like this one was pretty mediocre. I liked the character of Alex, but there wasn't a lot to this book. Firstly, it was really short, so it wraps up really neatly and I don't think that was very realistic. It was fine overall.",
            "Fade to BlackBy Alex FinnReviewed by Alina OswaldAIDS anxiety and stigma, prejudice, homophobia, harassment and hate crime, guilt and shame, pretense always clutter the truth. Unfortunately, they are all pieces of our reality and we find them in Alex Finn's Young Adult novel, Fade to Black where, the author-a former attorney-invites us to a small town trial where AIDS fills the courtroom.The victim-Alejandro Crusan, or Alex-is a Florida junior high-school student attacked and hit with a baseball bat while waiting in his car at a traffic light. The reason? ...His HIV-positive status and the belief that he is gay.The accused-Clinton Cole-sometimes shares the same classroom with Alex. Clinton's existence is a cluster of homophobia, AIDS anxiety, and prejudice.The witness-Daria-is a Down syndrome girl ignored and bullied by most students. We find parallels between the three main characters that link them to issues surrounding AIDS: each one of them deals, one way or another, with disabilities-physical or mental, each one of them has a secret that threatens to come out as the story progresses and, consequently, make them unfit for the small town society in which they live. For that not to happen, they have to pretend that they are worth being part of their society. The verdict-guilty or not guilty-surfaces through alternating testimonies and stories of the three main characters, but for the truth to come out the characters may have to divulge their secrets, because each one has a well-protected secret he or she is afraid to share with the world. But are the characters of Fade to Black ready for the truth? Maybe the more important question is: are we, the readers, ready to hear the truth and witness life-long hidden secrets we can rely on? The answer waits for us between the pages of Fade to Black. As for the verdict... it goes beyond the covers of this courageous and remarkable book. This review was originally published in A&amp,U Magazine--America's AIDS Magazine."

Ada's Daughter recounts the life of Nigerian-born Jacqueline Maduneme who endured and overcame physical and emotional pain and suffering most anyone would find impossible to process or heal from. This intense account takes us from her early age to current day, and in her gift for storytelling, Jacqueline takes you through a journey that is spellbinding, terrifying, and ultimately redemptive and emancipating. From an exorcism in a Nigerian graveyard to luxury hotels in Europe, Ada's Daughter presents scenes of shocking abuse and cruelty interspersed with the foibles of a colorful cast of characters and also moments of great joy. An account of how one woman transcended her abusive past and self-destructive behavior to find success in her business and personal life, Ada's Daughter is also a story about a mother and a daughter, a family, and a culture that has until now been a mystery to most of us in the Western world. Ada's Daughter is a mesmerizing journey to the heart of what survival means, and creates a new dimension and understanding of what the human spirit can endure and what the soul deeply desires. Jacqueline Maduneme's story will amaze even the most jaded reader. Her victory is one that you will want to share with others and celebrate with her.",

            "There are no literary bells and whistles in this book, but it is well edited with an easily readable style. Those who have been at the butt of sexual abuse may find that Ada\u2019s Daughter brings up painful memories that had been repressed, but maybe speaking out will help them on the journey of finding healing. While some may argue that Jacqueline\u2019s middle-class upbringing subtracts from the book\u2019s impact, I think it is good to know that wealth is no barrier to abuse and dysfunction. And it is past time to start a conversation on these themes that are often swept under the carpet in our society. I believe Jacqueline wrote this memoir with a lot of sensitivity, there is not prettying up the abuse, but neither is it offered up for readers to make salacious mockery of. The most powerful part of this book however, is that at the end of it all, the author has found some sort of healing and acceptance with the people and the circumstances of her past."

She goes through so much without ever being defeated, and for every moment of absolute horror and abuse that Jacqueline Maduneme had to live through (and there are many) there's a moment of grace, forgiveness or beauty. It's also a fascinating study of Nigerian culture as well as American culture and Maduneme explores both with an analytical eye."

When the king comes across her, he realizes how important she is to him. Taking advantage of her amnesia, he tells her that they're engaged. Bemused, Andi goes along with the charade for a day--but then her memory returns. The king asks her to give him just three days to convince her to stay. At the end of the three days, Andi flees, sure that he's just marrying her for convenience. Naturally, this makes him realize he's in love with her, and makes a dramatic public declaration. The series ends with her 7 months pregnant, and Queen of Ruthenia.This book is too lightweight to have many thoughts about it. The most entertaining aspect was how twisted everyone's logic had to be to satisfy the romance requirements. Like, Jake (aka the king!) has to marry one of the glamorous bratty noblewomen in order to keep his country happy. But he doesn't want to marry them, because he doesn't love them. Then he decides to marry Andi to keep her working for him, and rationalizes it by thinking that a marriage doesn't require love, after all, his parents didn't love each other. bzuh? This kind of nonsensical, constantly changing characterization is typical of the book.",

King Jake brought his loyal and uber professional assistant Andi with him. Upon regaining the throne, Jake promised his countrymen he would choose a bride by Ruthenia's third Independence Day celebration (mere weeks away). Being pursued by the daughters of the country's elite, Jake is trying to decide which of the conniving dears he finds least repugnant. Andi, who has loved Jake since she became his assistant six years ago, cannot bear the thought of watching him court and marry someone else. She hands in her resignation to Jake (who is stunned) and plans to leave right away.Late that night, Jake finds Andi, who after a conk on the head cannot remember anything. Seeing a solution to his problems (losing his faithful assistant and having to pick a bride), Jake tells Andi that they had gotten engaged earlier that evening. Andi feels something isn't quite right, but believes Jake since he seems familiar and comfortable. And then...When Andi regains her memory, she confronts Jake. He convinces her to play along until after the Independence Day celebration and then make her decision. Andi chooses to leave, thinking Jake doesn't return her love. Meanwhile, Jake realizes that what started out as a desire to keep his assistant has turned into true love. He predictably chases after her...And they live happily ever after.I almost quit reading this one at page 80. I was flabbergasted that Jake would even consider taking advantage of Andi by lying to her and yes, seducing her. I guess I have come to expect more from my heroes. However, I soldiered on. By the end, the author managed to turn Jake around. I finally found some sympathy for the jerk and managed to cheer when he and Andi finally reunited...but it was a close call. "

            "Serendipity, what a strange thing.Jeffery and Trudie recently reviewed an Angry Robots book Dead Harvest, an imprint of which is Strange Chemistry. After finishing reading their reviews, what should pop up in my inbox but an invite from Strange Chemistry to review an ARC of Emilie and the Hollow World, which I accepted.If you are a fan of steam-punk, this is a good, fast, light read that takes no risks with the formula nor sets new standards in the genre. The story reminds me strongly of the more memorable moments of Jacques Tardi's The Adventures of Adele Blanc Sec and the cover is quite an enticing eyeful.My issues centred around the technical - the text would have benefited from both in-line and structural editing - some of the minor plot points don't bear too much scrutiny, commas incorrectly placed, incorrect speech attribution, redundant sentences and doubling up of description - if something is round, a young adult reader doesn't need to be told twice to grasp the picture. Some author ethics filtered through Emilie which strained belief in her as a character and Emilie's dialogue veered at times between ridiculously juvenile and suspiciously adult, not to mention including colloquialisms or epithets which simply don't fit in a the mouth of a character set in a squarely Victorian steam-punk world. A little more attention to the mechanics of Victorian society would have helped with the world building.Plus points that bear mention: gently sarcastic nods in the direction of sexism in the genre, a assured and unobtrusive handling of the magic (aether) without any long-winded explanations for why it worked, zero gratuitous violence, and for the most part, a crisp and clean prose style (which emphasised the sub-par editing, but as this is an ARC, I presuming these issues will be remedied before going to press) that rendered description of Emilie's Hollow World, as well as her home, readily imaginable.Philip Reeve's Mortal Engines is the more in-depth read, but this book is worth attention, too.",
            "Great title! Though I'd be reading whatever it was called, of course.Lot of nice descriptions of the underwater world and the world itself is typically well-done, but this hasn't the solidity and nuance I'd been hoping for. As others have said, this is much more for younger readers than YA, which is only a problem because it was marketed YA. Still, I enjoyed it and hope that further instalments may be stronger.",
            "Originally published at Risingshadow.I admit that I'm difficult to please when it comes to young adult fantasy fiction, because most new YA fantasy books tend to be boring and full of annoying descriptions about teenage love affairs between humans and supernatural beings etc, but fortunately there are books like Emilie and the Hollow World out there. Emilie and the Hollow World is one of the few recent books that have restored my faith in YA fantasy fiction.Martha Wells is an amazingly versatile and talented author, because she writes all kinds of fantasy books. With Emilie and the Hollow World she proves that no matter what she writes about she always does it well. Emilie and the Hollow World is her first young adult book, and in my opinion it's an excellent achievement, because it's an old-fashioned adventure story which will be of interest to young adults and adults alike. I have to confess that I was impressed by this book.Here's a bit of information about the story:Emilie is a sixteen year old girl who escapes from her uncle Yeric and aunt Helena, because she doesn't want to live the life that has been planned for her. She wants to go to live with her cousin. Emilie wants to stow away on the steampship Merry Bell to Silk Harbour, but things don't go as she planned and she finds herself on the The Sovereign, which is headed to the centre of the planet, the Hollow World. The passengers and the crew of Sovereign search for Lady Marlende's father who ran into trouble when he visited the Hollow World...And here's information and my thoughts about some of the characters:- Emilie is an easily likeable character, who's just as stubborn as she is clever. She easily makes new friends and doesn't give up. She reminded me of the resourceful and courageous children and teenagers in Enid Blyton's books.- Lady Marlende is a fascinating character, because she takes Emilie under her protection. She's an important role model for Emilie. It was interesting to read how she tried to search for her father and what she thought about several things.- Kenar and Rani are also interesting characters, because they're a reptilian-like Cirathi who live in the Hollow World. It was intriguing to read about them.There are also other characters, but I won't write about them, because I want to avoid writing spoilers.I think it's brave of Martha Wells to write this kind of a fantasy adventure and tell the happenings through the eyes of a teenaged girl. Most adventure stories feature boys as main characters, so reading about the wondrous adventures of a teenaged girl felt refreshing.Worldbuilding works well, because the author has created a wonderful fantasy world. The surface world is an alternate Victorian world, which is a bit similar to the world in the Ile-Rien books (the author has created a wonderfully steampunk flavoured world where science and magic exist in harmony). The inner world, the Hollow World, is a richly imagined fantasy world, which reminded me of The Three Worlds in Books of the Raksura trilogy (the author wrote about merpeople, Cirathi and plant-creatures etc. in a similar way as she did about the Raksura - the only difference was that she wrote about these things for young adults). This was a fantastic combination for me, because I like both series. I'm sure that other readers, who are familiar with the author's adult books, will be fascinated by this combination.The Hollow World offers lots of lush landscapes for the readers. The author writes captivatingly about ancient ruins, oceans, civilizations and beings. The Hollow World is a totally different kind of a world than the surface world, because its inhabitants are different from humans (I have to mention that the matriarchal culture and civilization of the merpeople is simply compelling in its strangeness).One of the best things about Emilie and the Hollow World is that the author doesn't underestimate the intelligence of her readership, but writes vividly about science, aether currents, engines and magic. She doesn't overwhelm her readers with too many details and descriptions about these things, but keeps everything interesting. She writes fascinatingly about scientific discoveries and inventions. I enjoyed reading about the aether currents and engines that are used to travel to the Hollow World. These marvels will be of interest to several readers who appreciate old-fashioned steampunk and sciece fiction stories.I also enjoyed reading about The Sovereign and its crew. The author wrote fascinatingly about the ship, because it was almost like a combination of a submarine and a normal ship that has been converted to an aether-ship that can travel the aether currents.One of the most interesting things about this book is that Martha Wells writes fluently about a woman's place and social structure in the Victorian society and how difficult it is for women to be who they want to be. It was interesting to read what Emilie thought about her situation and her aunt and uncle, because she couldn't tolerate the life they wanted her to live.Martha Wells has a good sense of humour. She knows how to lighten the mood with witty and sarcastic comments. I enjoyed reading about Emilie's thoughts about several things, because her observations were often funny.I think it's good that the author has written a fast-paced story that contains plenty of happenings from the first page to the last page. The first half of the book is fun to read, but things really get going in the second half of the book and it's almost impossible to stop reading the story, because you have to find out what's going to happen to the characters.In my opinion Emilie and the Hollow World is almost like a tribute to Jules Verne. I've always liked Jules Verne's books, so I was very pleased to find out that the author had written this book in the vein of Jules Verne. I think that especially Verne's The Journey to the Centre of the Earth (Voyage au centre de la Terre) has been a source of inspiration to her. (I'll also mention that Jules Verne wasn't the only author that came to my mind when I read this book. It's possible that the author may also have been inspired by Enid Blyton and other similar authors.)If I'm not mistaken, there will be a sequel, Emilie and the Sky World, which will be published next year, so fans of Emilie will soon have more to read. I can hardly wait to read it, because I enjoyed reading Emilie and the Hollow World.Emilie and the Hollow World is one of the best and most entertaining YA books I've ever read, because it's a charming old-fashioned adventure book. It's been a long time since I've read anything like this. It's a shame that there aren't more this kind of books out there on the market.If you expect adventure, danger, science and magic from your young adult fantasy, you'll love Emilie and the Hollow World, because it contains all of these elements in an entertaining format. It's an exciting adventure story with lots of heart and imagination.Highly recommended for readers of all ages who enjoy good adventure stories!",
            "My dad really enjoyed the Journey to the Center of the Earth film starring James Mason and Pat Boone so I watched it many (MANY) times as a child. I liked it - the idea of tunneling underground and finding a fantastical world, dangerous creatures, and lots of adventure. I just had one problem with it.There was no girl character my age.Blah, blah, social norms of the time, scandal, ruined future, blah, blah. I didn't care.I largely still don't.As I read Wells' Emilie &amp, the Hollow World, I felt like my childhood fantasies had sprung to life. A strange world at the center of the earth? Check. Magic? Check. Fantastical beings and monsters? Check. A young, smart heroine? Check plus!I was giddy with nostalgic joy. I wish I had this book when I was younger. I am buying the print version to go in my kids' library. I devoured this book and loved every second. I also obviously must read more books by Martha Wells.Emilie has run away from home and is planning on stowing away on a ship so that she can try to start a new life at her cousin's school. Emilie's mother ran away and became an actress, but she and Emilie's father died, so our heroine was raised by her very disapproving uncle and aunt who believe Emilie is a ticking time bomb ready to become disreputable. Of course, things go awry and Emilie ends up stowing away on the wrong ship. It is under attack by nefarious types and soon is underway on a voyage to the center of the earth, with Emilie along for the ride. She meets and befriends new beings and an adventuress who leads the life Emilie dreams about, proves she has good instincts in a fight, is afraid but works through it, always keeps her head and is loyal throughout. This is a fast-paced book with lots of action and was just a lot of fun.While I did draw some parallels between Verne's book and this one, Emilie is not a retelling of Journey to the Center of the Earth. It is set in a unique world, with magic and airships, and while the adventurous spirit is there, they are different books.Emilie is published by Strange Chemistry, Angry Robot's YA imprint. I also think that this book would be fine for younger, middle-grade and even some tween readers. There is some violence, but nothing gory. This is also another YA with no romance. There is a bit of flirting with the seeds planted for something perhaps in the future, but that is just a tiny aside, to be honest.This book does work as a standalone, but I do hope that someday we will get Emilie's next adventure.received an arc",
            "The good stuff: Martha Wells has always excelled at worldbuilding, and the alternate reality of this book is no exception. It's strongly reminiscent of H.G. Wells and Jules Verne's stories--obviously, since it's about a world that exists at the center of ours--and I think it's not a stretch to tag it as steampunk, though the substance powering the devices of that reality is aether, not steam. The story's sustained action keeps things moving, it reads very much like a Victorian adventure novel. And I like the alien races Wells creates, villainous and not.The less good stuff: This is supposed to be a young adult novel, and in terms of content, it is, but stylistically, this is closer to being a juvenile novel. I had the hardest time remembering that Emilie was supposed to be 16, she acted and was treated as if she were closer to 12. I normally won't dismiss a book for being something other than what I wanted, but in this case, I think all the signs point to this being supposed to be a true YA title, so I think this is a valid criticism. A novel in this tradition (the Victorian action-adventure novel) is supposed to be light, but this is maybe too light. I enjoyed it well enough, but frankly, I expect more from Martha Wells.",
            "The two Emilie books are in some ways outliers from Martha Wells' oeuvre. They're YA , and a bit light and softer as a result, compared to her occasionally rather dark adult novels. But the other elements are there. Unusual but highly realistic fantasy worlds worlds, an emphasis on exploration and cross-cultural contact, lots of very memorable characters, and a good eye for pacing.I'd put these somewhere in the middle of Wells's work. Not quite the tour-de-force that is Murderbot or City of Bones, but still a pair of pleasant reads, and one I expect I'll be rereading in due time."

Translated into English for the first time in 1978 and out of print since the early 1980s, this new edition, with an introduction by Michael Moon, will make available this vital and still relevant work to contemporary audiences. Integrating psychoanalytic and Marxist theory, this book describes the social and psychic dynamics of what has come to be called homophobia and on how the \"homosexual\" as social being has come to be constituted in capitalist society.Significant as one of the earliest products of the international gay liberation movement, Hocquenghem's work was influenced by the extraordinary energies unleashed by the political upheavals of both the Paris \"May Days\" of 1968 and the gay and lesbian political rebellions that occurred in cities around the world in the wake of New York's Stonewall riots of June 1969.Drawing on the theoretical work of Gilles Deleuze and F\u00e9lix Guattari and on the shattering effects of innumerable gay \"comings-out,\" Hocquenghem critiqued the influential models of the psyche and sexual desire derived from Lacan and Freud. The author also addressed the relation of capitalism to sexualities, the dynamics of anal desire, and the political effects of gay group-identities.Homosexual Desire remains an exhilarating analysis of capitalist societies' pervasive fascination with, and violent fear of, same-sex desire and addresses issues that continue to be highly charged and productive ones for queer politics.",

            "In his polemical 1978 (English translation) Homosexual Desire, Guy Hocquenghem makes the case that society hates the homosexual, that there is something about him that disturbs society (49). However, this is interesting, because there is no homosexual desire \u2014 that is, desire is multiple and not directed toward men or women simply (49-50). Society becomes paranoid about the homosexual, suffering: from an interpretive delusion which leads it to discover all around it the signs of a homosexual conspiracy that prevents it from functioning properly (55).Hocquenghem critiques the Freudean explanation of homosexuality as rooted in the Oedipal Complex, seeing it (from a Deleuzian perspective) as rooted in the family instead of in history, and as a construction of the whole family romance (81). He then goes on to critique society for being ruled by the order of the family, even if sexual freedoms have increased and marriage isn't necessary, the family is the rule inhabiting every individual under free competition. This individual does not replace the family, he prolongs its farcical games (93).Hocquenghem understands our society as a phallic society, and the quantity of possible pleasure is determined in relation to the phallus (95): ejaculation is prized in sex, society is hierarchical, and the phallus is social (96). The anus, however, is private, has no social position except sublimation (96), does not exist in the penetrate/penetrated dichotomy of the phallus (97), and is withdrawn socially (97). This might be understood metaphorically, as in understanding that to control the anus is to control the social self (the most distressing social act is to soil one's pants) (99). Social use of the anus, Hocquenghem argues, involves the risk of a loss of identity (101). Additionally, homosexuals offer a different way to organize society than the reproduction of the family (and that one should be like their parents) (106-109).Hocquenghem explores desire, arguing that desire is object-oriented, not oriented toward a sex or gender (130). The cruising homosexual becomes akin to Deleuze's voyaging schizophrenic (131), because everything is possible at any moment: organs look for each other and plug in, unaware of the law of exclusive disjunction (131). He critiques revolutionary thought for maintaining the public/private distinction, and offers that homosexuals make private intervene in public (136) and a chance to disintegrate the civilized illusion common to the political world (145). Homosexuality offers something outside of politics and the social as it is now known, refusing to capitulate to the logic of sacrifice for the future (147).",

If Deleuze and Guattari are a little too inaccessible this text works with similar themes, has just as much punch, and is more stylistically accessible. ",

        "desc": "In 1842 Phineas T. Barnum is a young man, freshly arrived in New York and still unknown to the world. With uncanny confidence and impeccable timing, he transforms a dusty natural history museum into a great ark for public imagination. Barnum's museum, with its human wonders and extraordinary live animal menagerie, rises to become not only the nation's most popular attraction, but also a catalyst that ushers America out of a culture of glassed-in exhibits and into the modern age of entertainment.,In this kaleidoscopic setting, the stories of two compelling characters are brought to life. Emile Guillaudeu is the museum's grumpy taxidermist, who is horrified by the chaotic change Barnum brings to his beloved institution. Ana Swift is a professional giantess plagued by chronic pain and jaded by a world of gawkers. The differences between these two are many: one is isolated and spends his working hours making dead things look alive, while the other has people pushing against her, and reacting to her, every day. But they both move toward change, one against his will, propelled by a paradigm shift happening whether he likes it or not, and the other because she is struggling to survive. In many shapes and forms, metamorphosis is at the core of ,Among the Wonderful,. Pursuing this theme, the book weaves a world where upper Manhattan is still untrammeled wilderness, the Five Points is at the height of its bloody glory, and within the walls of Barnum's museum, ancient tribal feuds play out in the midst of an unlikely community of marvels.",

            "The premise of this book immediately drew it to me - P.T. Barnum had a large life, and one that would easily make for a riveting fictionalization. There is just so much promise there - unfortunately, this book simply did not deliver. The book lacked a plot, a solid story line and most conflicts that did arise went unresolved in the end. The overall structure and narration fell apart into a mess and were too weak to pull me through. I did finish the book, but mostly because I just felt like I was waiting for something else to happen. There were two main narrators - a taxidermist (be prepared for some shockingly grisly descriptions of that craft) and a giantess (though her narrative sections are oddly interrupted by interludes from a third narrator). These characters rarely overlap or interact with one another, and even the predictable (if you know your history)conclusion fails to pull these disparate narratives together. The use of different P.O.V.s further broke up any semblance of unity the book had. I really wanted to like this book, but its lack of plot, cohesion and sympathetic characters just made that impossible. The motivations for the taxidermist were not completely developed and he was such a negative person, and so unlikable. Plus his work and nightmares were more befitting a horror novel than historical fiction. And Ana, the giantess, was also a negative force in the book. So much revolved around her size, that the woman within that flesh was rather lost. Which was disappointing because it was obvious that it was the exact opposite reaction that the author wanted. And as for Barnum himself? Well, Carlson certainly used him to suck me into the book, but here he is portrayed as a shifty, shadowy villain who's absence defined the book more than his presence.",
            "An intriguing and sometimes compelling but ultimately frustrating book for me. I suppose it's that as I get older I'm just more easily frustrated by beautiful stories that insist on tragedy, and more specifically insist on tragedy for those who are different. I love the primary narrator, Ana a giantess, even as I longed for her to live her life rather than sacrifice it. Also, I disliked seeing what seems now to be a common trope of circus marvels who refuse to be attracted to or romantically involved with a fellow marvel. It's hard not to see it as the author's own refusal to view them as fully human and desirable. "

            "Great Historical Novel about Barnum and his New York City MuseumIrresistible from the very first page to the last, Stacy Carlson's Among the Wonderful is such an unbelievably great historical novel that its characters and setting will linger long in the reader's memory. It's the best novel I have read on mid Nineteen Century New York City, a big, bold, and brash novel replete with P. T. Barnum's larger-than-life persona, noteworthy for its exquisite detail of lower Manhattan, from the relatively tranquil steps of City Hall to the noisy, often dangerous, Five Points slum, and yet one which will resonate strongly with contemporary readers awash in a culture replete with sensational celebrity gawking and narcissistic navel gazing. It's also one that offers readers a most compelling look at human dignity with respect to women, children and those who are deemed little better than savages like the American Indians and other human exhibits residing in the museum. Hers is a most compelling saga as seen through the eyes of taxonomist Emile Guillaudeu and gigantess Ana Swift, as each must contend with the veritable chaos that is P. T. Barnum's newly acquired natural history museum. Guillaudeu is confounded constantly by the dramatic ongoing metamorphosis of the museum's collection, from a rather staid cabinet of natural curiosities into a zoo and theater replete with a beluga whale, monkeys, human giants and American Indians adorned in their native costumes. Infuriated by Barnum's purchase of the museum and his unorthodox leadership, Guillaudeu eventually resigns himself to his newly acquired status of uneasy coexistence, and is unexpectedly recognized for his work in conserving and in curating, the museum's collections. Swift, on the other hand, is an emotionally far more complex figure than Guillaudeu, often suffering in pain from the physical and emotional afflictions due to her unusual size, but still a most formidable individual who becomes unexpectedly, the unofficial leader and emissary of her fellow museum inhabitants. Carlson's novel is truly a feast for the eyes, and one that is certain to be well remembered as among this year's best. (Reposted from my 2011 Amazon review)",
            "This review originally posted on my blog : http://utahmomslife.blogspot.com/2011...In 1842, Phineas T. Barnum purchased the Scudder Natural History Museum in New York City with plans to make it into a showcase of the world's wonders. Filling the building with treasures and curiosities in order to fascinate and marvel the general population becomes his passion. Ana Swift, the world's only giantess, moves into the apartments on the 5th floor of the museum as one of Barnum's employees. Her job is simply to walk among the visiting crowds each day in the museum.Guillaudeu is the aging taxidermist who has spent his career in Scudder's museum and balks at the transformation of the museum under the new ownership.Stacy Carlson's new novel Among the Wonderful is the story of Barnum's museum, the curiosities and the people who work and live inside it's walls. With gracious and fine writing, Carlson opens up and displays Barnum's spiraling and mysterious museum with it's hidden galleries and human treasures. While the people who inhabit it are what the world called freaks and Barnum called wonders, a hirsute woman, Siamese twins, albinos, natives, dwarfs, and giants, Carlson writes of them with a profound human touch, turning the reader from the voyeuristic tourist to the sympathetic and accepting soul.The characters are richly developed and vastly different from the stereotypes that inhabit most stories about carnivals, fairs and circuses. Ana, the giantess, is so lovingly portrayed in all her heartache, hope and pain that she will be a literary character I will not soon forget. Guillaudeau, too, is a timeless character dealing with the very universal human emotions of aging, loss and dealing with change. His own metamorphosis is interesting to watch even as he bemoans the vast and sweeping changes in the museum.With skill and style, Carlson takes a foot note of history and works it into a lovely and sweeping novel. Carlson excells as a story teller but proves herself, even more, as a compassionate and thoughtful observer of the human condition.",
            "In this fantastic debut novel, the author describes the lives of the 'wonderful' inhabitants of P.T. Barnum's Museum in Manhattan in the 1840's. Ana Swift is a giantess, haunted by the knowledge that she will likely die before reaching the age of 40. Emile Guillaudeu is the resident taxidermist and animal keeper, he is haunted by the death of his unfaithful wife. He wanders the museum, depressed that the new occupants, a bearded lady, conjoined twins, albino children, have replaced the previous tenants, the natural history museum that was his life's work. The residents if the museum have become a hodge-podge family of sorts, including the singing beluga whale that coexists with various warring American Indian tribes.In this accomplished novel, the museum's 'wonders' battle their demons and finally allow others to see who they are on the inside, rather than keeping themselves separate by virtue of their 'differentness'. The author reminds us that it is not our outward appearance that matters but our universally human need for love and understanding. I am very excited about this novel and what the future holds for it's talented author.",

            "This is set nine years after, \u201cThe Quiet Twin,\u201d and, although not a sequel as such, it helps if you have read the earlier book as many characters from that book feature or are mentioned.  It is 1948 and Anna Beer is returning to Vienna to meet her estranged husband, Dr Anton Beer. On the train journey with her is Robert Seidel, whose father, Detective Teuben, also featured in \u201cThe Quiet Twin.\u201d The two arrive in a Vienna which is hardly recognisable from the city they left before the war.  Robert\u2019s mother had remarried after the death of his father and he has become concerned by her odd letters. He arrives at the family home to find his step father has been pushed out of a window, his brother, Wolfgang, arrested for the crime and Poldi, Wolfgang\u2019s young and pregnant wife, installed in a bedroom listening to music and flicking through magazines. Nobody seems to be interested in his arrival and the new maid (the \u2018crooked maid\u2019 of the book\u2019s title) seems openly hostile, while a strange man appears to be watching the house.Meanwhile, Anna returns to her apartment to find her husband gone. She enlists the help of Karel Neumann, a Czech who was in a prisoner of war camp with Anton, to help find him. There is also a side story about the Rothman family, who claim they were the original owners of the home the Seidel\u2019s are currently living in.I really loved \u201cThe Quiet Twin,\u201d but, although I really enjoyed this, it seemed to lack the coherence of the earlier book. Both books have a good cast of intertwining characters and a fantastic sense of place. However, somehow, the plot of this book got a little confused and lost for me. I enjoyed the atmosphere of a post-war Vienna, going into the Cold War, and there were many nods to Dostoevsky (one of my favourite authors) which I also appreciated. However, somehow this sadly did not quite make a 5 star read for me. There is, though, no doubt that Dan Vyleta is an immensely talented author and I would like to re-read this in the future and feel I will perhaps appreciate it more if I come back to it later.",
            "Loose sequel to The Quiet Twin and a suspensful edge on the seat read that kept me turning the pages till the great ending, superb characters in Anna de Beer, Robert Siedel, Annelise (the crooked back girl from Quiet twin who is now the title character) and the mysterious and seedy former POW and current bum and survivor at all costs, German Czech Karel Neumann, though 1948 Vienna is in a way the main character though we take a tour to the tragic past too. I will just add the author's afterword to get a sense of the book as it reflects superbly what is in, depending on how it wears in time, this could go to my top 25 list tooWhen I set out to write The Crooked Maid, I had contracted the Balzacian bug: I wanted to write a world, not a book. All the same, a world must be assembled piece by piece. The train ride came to me early, as did the theme of parricide, both in conscious homage to Dostoevsky, whose books I love. Other, less conscious, Dostoevskianisms have crept in, further proof that books are dangerous things: you read them and they impose on you not just their words but a whole sensibility, not incidents but a mode of seeing reality. Structurally, the book owes much to Dickens. I read Our Mutual Friend early into its writing, and took note of Dickens\u2019s daring in stacking incident upon incident (and coincidence upon coincidence), of his ability to connect characters high and low through crime, family scandal, and the brittle threads of chance, of his book\u2019s unstable tone that drifts from comedy to tragedy and back and is capable, despite its author\u2019s much-decried sentimentalism, of calling forth real emotion, and of his deft management of the book\u2019s vast cast (Dickens would have made a good film director).The trial at the centre of The Crooked Maid owes much to Kay Boyle\u2019s wonderful 1950 New Yorker reportage on a Frankfurt war crimes trial. Many of its details are directly inspired by this report, which is a wonderful literary performance in its own right and (along with Boyle\u2019s other essays on postwar Germany) deserves to be rediscovered by a wider readership.The Crooked Maid is set only two years after my first book, Pavel &amp, I (albeit in a different city), but the postwar moment it depicts is quite distinct. If Pavel &amp, I captures the catastrophe of deprivation at its lowest\u2014and coldest\u2014point, The Crooked Maid is interested in the social and moral flux that accompanied the early years of reconstruction. The year 1948, when the book is set, was a year of change. West Berlin had been cut off by the Soviets and had to be supplied by air, Czechoslovakia had gone Communist, and Vienna was rumoured to be riddled with spies: the Cold War had started in earnest. At the same time, identities were shifting, and an assertive type of Austrian nationalism that distanced itself from Germany, and was given licence by the Allies to describe Austria as the first victim of an expansionist Reich rather than its willing bride, was gaining ground. POWs were still returning home, displaced persons languished in camps, denazification was slowly being wound down. In Vienna itself\u2014a city that combines aspects of the metropolis and the village\u2014neighbours, work colleagues, and families faced each other across the chasm of their respective war experiences, a drama played out in the shadow of entire strata of society who had been murdered by the Nazi regime. I did not want to exploit the suffering that took place in this age of uncertainty but simply to understand it: so I started far from it, in a cozy train compartment, over a cup of sweet (yet bitter) tea",
            "This is a macabre but a fascinating story set in post WWII Vienna. This book was a 2013 Giller Prize finalist, and an odds-on favourite to take the coveted prize. It didn't win the prize, but it certainly is a book that belongs on the short list. This book's strength is it's remarkable sense of time and place. Vyleta describes post-war Vienna so well that it felt like I was there. The people and the city are all trying to recover from the war that took so much from them. It's almost post-apoplyptic as I'm sure a lot of German cities were after the allied invasion. Vyleta does a remarkable job with his characters too. As in so many books that I've been reading lately, I didn't really like any of the characters. They are certainly an imperfect lot in this book too, but I had to keep reading the book to see what happens to each of them. So many people that survived the War try to come back to their birthplace to try to determine what happened to their loved ones, their homes and their lives. There are so many pieces to try to find and a lot of the pieces are never found. Two very different people - Anna and Robert - are two of the people who are trying to come home to take up their lives, and they find that nothing is at all the same. Lost in a sea of uncertainty, they both turn to the strangest people for comfort and solace. The strangest of all is Eva, the crooked maid. Robert finds her at his familial home and is strangely drawn to this girl with the bent spine. Anna finds Karl, the Czech ex-soldier, and finds that she is inexplicably drawn to this huge and uncouth man. As events play out and as buried secrets come to light, Robert and Anna eventually are able to fill in some of the blanks from their previous lives. This is a dark and suspensful story that certainly kept me turning the pages.",
            "this was my first time reading dan vyleta and i thought this book very strong. i do wish, now, that i had read his previous novel, The Quiet Twin: A Novel, first. while each book can stand alone, characters recur. given the nature of my personality, i feel like i just did it wrong. heh!!so, the crooked maid is many things - historical fiction, mystery, literary fiction, homage. vyleta's ticking a lot of boxes with this book. is it always awesome? no. but it's very good and vyleta can really write. his ability with description is pretty stellar.in vyleta's acknowledgments, he says:When I set out to write The Crooked Maid, I had contracted the Balzacian bug: I wanted to write a world, not a book. All the same, the world must be assembled piece by piece. The train ride came to me early, as did the theme of patricide, both in conscious homage to Dostoevsky, whose books I love. Other, less conscious, Dostoevskianisms have crept in, further proof that books are dangerous things: you read them and they impose on you not just their words but a whole sensibility, not incidents but a mode of seeing reality.vyleta also notes dickens as another influence, because of dickens' \u201c...daring in stacking incident upon incident (and coincidence upon coincidence), his ability to connect characters high and low through crime, family scandal, and the brittle threads of chance\u2026\u201d vyleta is certainly not comparing himself (or his novel) to balzac, dostoevsky or dickens. he is only giving recognition to some heavy-weight writers with distinct styles who have impacted his writing. within 'the crooked maid' chekhov's gun makes an appearance, so that was cool too!so, given all of these mentions, it's not surprising that, in 'the crooked maid', we have a story about parricide, making use of coincidence, with a side of social commentary. it's all a bit meta, but i enjoy that. (and usually i am not a fan of coincidence\u2026at all. here, vyleta just makes it work in a way that didn't have me rolling my eyes while mumbling 'cop-out!'.)i am not being terribly coherent here, so apologies for that. there's a lot going on in this novel - but it's not overwhelming or confusing. i really enjoyed unravelling it all and felt as thought i was in very good hands.",
            "The Crooked Maid by Canadian writer Dan Vyleta is a murder mystery set in 1948 post war Vienna. The Third Reich has fallen and the Cold War is just beginning and a young Robert Seidel is returning home from Switzerland to Austria\u2019s capital by train. He travels in the same train car as Anna Beer, the wife of a Viennese Doctor Anton Beer, who is en route to a planned reconciliation with her husband. The two train travelers arrive home to respective mysteries, who killed Robert\u2019s father and where has Dr. Beer disappeared to?The book is riveting, it transports you to Vienna at a time when the rubble of the war and transition from Hitler\u2019s epoch to the new reconstruction is taking place. Within the physical and political residue of the devastation of war, the mysteries unravel. As Robert arrives home he finds his brother Wolfgang, a past member of the Nazi SS, about to go on trial for the murder of their father. Robert\u2019s mother is dealing with her grief and coping by the use of pharmaceutical drugs, while being caught in a battle of wits with the maid.This is a book of coincidences with some of the pivotal ones being tied to Annelise Grotter, the maid in the Seidel home. Annelise is a young woman with a crooked spine, and is connected by coincidence with the missing Doctor Beer. She becomes a love interest to Robert. Upon Robert\u2019s arriving home Annelise grounds him with a clear review of his situation.\u201cSo,\u201d she summarized, picking through his story and wondering distractedly if she should tell him hers, \u201cyour brother is a war criminal, your mother an addict, and there is a man watching the house. It\u2019s like something by Dumas.\u201dDan Vyleta\u2019s book is a cold war spy novel containing court room drama, double-agent style behavior and the inevitability of Russian conspiracies, within the historical context of denazification. It also deals with the dark side of the cultural framework of antisemitism of the time. Pivotal to the story line is the issue of transference of property from the Jews to the non-jewish during the war and secrets that were still quite fresh in 1948. Just because the war was over, that did not mean those that lost the war immediately changed their perceptions of the Jews, the Gypsies, the Ukranians etc. The murder trial of Wolfgang Seidel brings out the undercurrents within society and the outcome is unique.The book is one of the best I\u2019ve read in a long time, it receives the illusive sixth star. It was nominated for the Giller prize and rightly so. There is an earlier book by Dan Vyela The Quiet Twin, which has some of the same characters but is a separate novel unto itself, set in prewar Austria.Read other book reviews at www.ebooknew.ca",
            "In his afterword, Vyleta explains that he is trying to create a world in his book. While he indeed accomplishes this, it just wasn't a world I loved being in. He spends a considerable amount of time on the details and symbolism. This isn't a bad thing at all, as he creates an interesting setting, however, he devotes so much time to these things that the characters and plot often seem like afterthoughts. It makes for a tedious read. I took me a long time to get through this and I wished Vyleta had spent as much time on developing his characters than he did on other aspects of the book. The characters were a bit flat and their interactions were often perplexing, though both had the potential to be quite interesting. It was the making of something really good, it just didn't bring it home for me. There is also so much going on, and it's hard to figure out what this book is trying to be. In the end, my rating comes from the fact that I was pretty indifferent to it as a whole package (despite the fact that it must have been interesting enough for me to stick with it), was not sorry to be finished, and didn't care enough to really do the work required to delve into some of his symbolism."

            "My dear Eliza,Your sister, Dido Kent, while estimable in most matters, has perpetrated a great injury, for, in producing a novel of her time at Charcombe Manor during April 1807 \u2014 a novel so infused with curiosity &amp, suspense \u2014 she has inconsiderately ignored her duty to her gentle readers. Surely, a young woman of six &amp, thirty years has developed sufficient sense and knowledge of the world that she must know that such a fascinating tale must lead to her readers staying up all night to finish a tale to rival the Gothic romances of the infamous Mrs. Radcliffe? Pray make no excuses for that selfish girl who \u2014 notably ignoring her sense of duty, nay, her sense of family obligation \u2014 commits a similar sin against the reading publick. Does Miss Kent\u2019s lack of propriety know no bounds? Her Aunt Manners would certainly confirm such a grievance.There! I\u2019ve gotten my Regency sensibilities out of the way!Dido Kent \u2014 plain, impoverished and considered a hopeless spinster at 36 \u2014 is sent to serve as companion to her imperious hypochondriac aunt, Selina Manners. The pair arrive at Charcombe Manor a day after a pretty young heiress named Letitia Verney vanished. As always, inquisitive, clever Miss Kent cannot resist a mystery. Told alternately in first-person narration and in letters to her beloved sister Eliza, Dido recounts her adventures in investigating Miss Verney\u2019s disappearance and an ensuing murder of a mystery man named Mr. Brodie, newly arrived from the West Indies. Are the two occurrences connected? Miss Kent certainly thinks so. Miss Kent redoubles her efforts when handsome, fortune-hunting rake Tom Lomax, the son of Miss Kent\u2019s secret love, the noble William Lomax, gets the blame for both tragedies.Anna Dean\u2019s fourth novel featuring the plucky Dido Kent truly did keep me reading into the wee hours. Dido skillfully puzzles out the many secrets hidden by the various denizens and victors to Charcombe Manor. Unlike with other period novels, Miss Kent never seems anachronistically modern, and, while comparisons to Jane Austen \u2014whether from life or from Stephanie Barron\u2019s excellent mystery series \u2014 are inevitable, Dido Kent remains very much an original and very likable character. The Dido Kent mystery series is the Regency mystery series for people who hate Regency mystery series: no anachronistically modern feminist ideas but a good appreciation of the arguments of Mary Wollstonecraft, no deus ex machina resolutions, no cheap romantic encounters completely counter to what would have been possible in leisured families of the early 19th century. What the reader will find is a plucky heroine who refuses to simper or fawn, who insists on using the brains God gave her, who won\u2019t allow delicacy to trump good sense, and who is intent \u2014 like Jane Austen and her sister Cassandra \u2014 to marry for love and not convenience. In other words, Dido Kent is a pure joy!Although readers new to the series will be able to read A Place of Confinement without difficulty, the mystery series will prove more satisfying if read in order.The final pages will gladden the hearts of longtime readers as William Lomax and Dido make their engagement official. Like Dido, suffering from the small torments administered by her haughty Aunt Manners, we readers, too, must suffer as we await the requisite year before the next eagerly awaited novel in the series.",
            "Lots of misdirection as Dido Kent arrives at a country house with her aunt, having been saved from being bullied into a dreadful marriage by being forced into being her aunt\u2019s companion. Dean\u2019s writing is improving, and the extra characters are becoming better-rounded but they are still mostly unnecessary to the plot. Dido starts by looking into the disappearance of a young heiress and ends up focused on a murder, architecture, and the problems of the son of her still-beloved Mr. Lomax.Plenty of fun callbacks to Jane Austen\u2019s life and works.",
            "First Sentence: My dear Eliza, I am in prison and I do not know how much longer I can bear my confinement. Spinster Dido Kent has been sent off to Charcombe Manor with wealthy and demanding Aunt Manners. Upon arriving, she learns that Miss Letitia Verney is missing, though to have eloped to Gretna Green with Tom Lomax, wastrel son of Dido\u2019s suitor, William. There is more than one puzzle to keep Dido busy. Why is Aunt Manners giving her jewelry to George, a brother she dislikes? Why is crying heard from a deserted part of the manor house? And most urgently, how can Dido prevent Tom from being hung for the murder of a man visiting George\u2019s new resort town near the estate.  From the very opening, it is hard to resist Ms. Dido Kent and the charming letter to her sister. Ms. Dean very cleverly creates the atmosphere of there being a mystery about to unfold without resorting to the clich\u00e9d use of a portent. Anyone familiar with Jane Austin will find themselves equating Dean\u2019s characters with those of Austin. Dean captures the details of the period perfectly from the societal structure, to the inclusion of a chamber horse, to the style of speech. \u201c\u2026And would you seek to change the world\u2019s opinion on the matter?\u201d \u201cI do not presume so far\u2026.I seek only to act as my conscience dictates. It is a matter of integrity, Mr. Lomax, not revolt.\u201d The relationship between Dido and William Lomax is wonderfully written and completely appropriate to the characters and the period.  Yet set into this period of lightness, Dean introduces murder and an element of the Gothic and dread through a grim discovery made by Dido. There does appear to be a small oversight in the logic needed to solve the crime, but it can be forgiven considering the very clever plot twist and even bigger surprise. The sub-theme of duty is very effective and adds depth to the story.  \u201cA Place of Confinement\u201d is wonderful. I do love Dido Kent and admire Ms. Dean\u2019s skill of creating a character who solves crimes in a way that is completely believable considering the constraints placed upon her by the period in which she is set. Do treat yourself and begin the series at the beginning.A PLACE OF CONFINEMENT (Hist Mys/Ama Sleuth-Dido Kent-England-Georgian/1807) \u2013 VG+Dean, Anna \u2013 4th in seriesMinotaur Books, 2013",
            "The word that comes to mind when I think of any of the books in this series is inevitably, lovely. That would be an odd thing to say about a murder mystery, but the driving force of these books is not the mystery (though that is certainly engaging) but the wonderful character of Miss Dido Kent, of whom I feel certain, even Miss Austen would approve.Anna Dean has created a memorable and, though this book is set in 1807, very 'real' character who it is a delight to follow around on her adventures.Another point I cannot neglect to make is Dean's excellent language. Her prose is both fluid, witty, and appropriate for the time she writes of. I won't summarize the plot, because that is done so well already, but I wanted to write a fittingly positive review for a book which made me smile more than a few times and which felt just the right balm for my winter woes.Find more reviews and bookish fun at http://www.princessandpen.com",
            "Thoroughly enjoyed the plot twists and the frequent Austen references or quotes, including the tongue in cheek reference to a phrase Miss Kent considers somewhat of a cliche -- do anything rather than marry without affection. What is the anything one can do instead, she wonders.",
            "These are supposed to be a cross between Jane Austen and Agatha Christie. It really surpassed my expectations. Good mystery.",
            "Another very readable historical mystery by Anna Dean. In this story, the redoubtable Miss Dido Kent faces her biggest challenge yet. Can she prove the innocence of a man she despises or will she have to watch the man's father, William Lomax, the man she has been in love with for most of the past three books, cut himself off from her forever, refusing to let her share in his shame? As with her previous books, Miss Dean dwells on the difficulties facing single women of little fortune in the early 19th century and paints a bleak picture of Dido's situation, being obliged to act as companion to an elderly relative because she refuses to marry where her family sees fit. Having suggested in my review of the previous book that Dido must have been an advocate of Mary Wollstonecraft's writing, I was amused to discover her actually reading 'A Vindication of the Rights of Woman' in this one!"

            "Despite previous comments that the things in this book are pretty much common sense, I think there's a lot of valuable information on communication here - one has to realise that a lot of programmers are socially awkward to begin with, and not everybody reads self-help and communication books. So, more books like this are needed. That being said, the rules in this book could apply to any kind communication, not just the software-related one.The only downside I found was that some themes were overdeveloped in comparison to others."

            "Easy to read book. It's amazing how hard is to see the lack of HTR (humility, trust and respect) we have when working in software development industry. Recommended to egocentric developers!",
            "Team Geek is a perfect read for every software engineer, no matter whether working in a big or small company.The book revolves around authors\u2019 careers as a software developers and later as a team leads/managers. As the authors\u2019 careers, the book also progresses from team work to managing people (a lot on that).People may disagree with this book\u2019s title since it says it\u2019s focused on a software developer\u2019s point of view, but actually focus a lot more on managers, but is that a bad thing?All employed software developers have someone responsible for managing them. Understanding that person\u2019s job and the meaning behind his/hers actions will help you build a better relationship with your manager and ease the work.Also, you\u2019ll be a much more responsible team member if you can micromanage yourself and not make that your manager\u2019s job. I mean, everybody hates being extensively micromanaged by others or doing that to others. And people working in smaller companies can\u2019t have the luxury of someone watching over your back all the time, so being a manager to yourself is a win-win situation.The Humility-Respect-Trust mantra is something we all know well, but the situations described through the chapters, make us give it all a second thought. Ben and Brian have faced more than most people have/will. Learning from their experience is a sure way to make the right call in more situations.So, do yourself, your team, your manager, a favor and read Team Geek by Brian W. Fitzpatrick, Ben Collins-Sussman.P.S The authors may have advertised Google a bit too much :D",
            "The book is ok, though pretty basic, advices can be summed up as don't be an asshole.Book concentrates on strategy, that is quite obvious, without saying almost anything about tactics, which is actually hard part - and very nuanced, so you can't really give an advice for every possible situation.On the positive side - it's easy to read, and can be read in a day or two, so you won't get bored.",
            "As many reviewers already mentioned - this is a fair book for entry level management / team lead role. Actually more for the latter. Although it's targeted for people working in any kind of organization (big or small) I actually think it's more meaningful for people working in medium / larger organizations (still people working in smaller organizations or involved, say, in open source project should find it useful).For anyone having at least some experience with working with people (especially as a leader) lots of advises will be obvious and basically common sense. Still if nothing else, this book may used as a nice reminder - personally I need to remind myself (refresh the cache ?) about some things from time to time.Overall I liked the writing style (which is informal) and the clear message. Also size of the book seems to be *appropriate* - I didn't feel lots of repetitiveness and even obvious advises weren't boring (and IMHO this is very common in books covering so called soft skills). Why 3 stars ? Basically there is nothing mind bending in this book or no really novel ideas. As the name of 3 star rating implies - I liked it but nothing more. Recommended book if you want to read something lightweight and fun in the category of management / leadership / general cooperation with people.",
            "This would be a good first book on management for developers. After managing for the last 4 years or so, I didn't find the book particularly interesting or new, I often found it a little too proud of itself. I read this part of a manager book club at work, I enjoyed the conversation that came out of having read the book more than the book itself.The ideas that did resonate with me from the book that were either things I had distinctly thought of, or that were a good reminder:- ask my reports what can I do for you me?- ask my reports what do you need from me?- my main job is to clear obstacles from my reports so they can get work done faster. This means not knowing answers is ok, but knowing who does know the answer is vital."

            "Review to come. I thought this was a very useful examination of using mindfulness practices to have deeper understanding and resonance among our conversations with other people. The author advocates a we-first approach to interpersonal communication practices, rather than what the author calls a me-first approach that's dominant in our society. There's quite a bit of useful information to take from this work, so I hope I can expound upon it in my upcoming review.",
            "This book explores various relationship issues through heavy use of metaphor. Toxic situations, red-yellow-green light patterns, open mind and open heart, unconditional friendliness, we first vs me first. I found the recommendations interesting, but not very insightful. Most of the situations seem fairly common and I agree with the premise that people who are focused on their own benefits over others tend to be the source of problems. Most of the lessons in this book are things we learned in Kindergarten. We may have forgotten those lessons, or been hurt somehow and build up defensive patterns. ",
            "This book really helped me understand the next step in my personal &amp, professional growth. It came at just the right time, too! I have numerous gifts, but two things that have been holding me back are: 1. distracted listening (letting my mind fill with my own ideas rather than properly processing what's happening right in front of me first) and 2. letting my overactive mind build a story around something that may or may not be truth &amp, then treating it as the truth (perception vs reality). I think meditation will be key for me to make headway with both, as it will allow me to practice the intentional removal of stray thoughts from a quiet &amp, clear mind. Stay tuned - 7 Habits are next!!"

            "The essential thought of this book is that if a man lives from a we-first point of view instead of a me-first perspective, both that individual and those that he or she come into contact with will have the advantage.As indicated by Chapman, the best approach to mindful communication is the thing that she calls the 'five key components,' which are silence, mirroring, encouraging, discerning, and responding. These abilities empower us to listen all the more deeply, to ourselves and to others.Valuable methods that the author recommends to help in this procedure of opening up include naming listening as either green-light, red-light or yellow-light examples. Red-light is the point at which we would prefer not to tune in, or when we are diverted to the point that we can't hear them. Yellow-light listening is when there is confusion in the matter of whether genuine listening is occurring or not. Things I favored from this book: * It has numerous methods &amp, strategies to change negative methods for listening and reacting to others into extremely positive ones. * Chapman gives cases of how individuals have been casualties they could call their own negative habits and how to overcome it. * How to have or create happier relationships not based on Me-first, but on We-first.",
            "This is a fantastic book.The author, psychologist and Buddhiste, explains very detailed what the successive steps are to achieve meaningful communication according to the tradition of Mindfulness and Buddhism.The theoretical explanation and exercises to learn to communicate this mindful are clear.The book is peppered with experiences from her practice as a psychologist, her friends and her teachers during the nine years she spent in the Gampo Abbey in Canada.Ten or twenty years ago I would have caught quasi from this book and even deduced it if swevere, but once you are familiar with Buddhist leather you really summarize what you want to achieve.This book has learned me a lot.I have read twice in the meantime, but it won't stay at those 2 times.It invites to practice, exercise and continue to practice ...",
            "Excellent read from a European based family and marriage expert. Chapman takes the ideas of conversation beyond the family unit by expanding and applying the communication techniques to encompass needs of a much broader audience. Considering a woeful lack of heart to heart conversations in our digital content driven culture, I found the book to be a wonderful reminder to slow down and simply talk. \u2022 Mindful Presence (awake body, tender heart, open mind) \u2022 Mindful Listening (encouragement) \u2022 Mindful Speech (gentleness) \u2022 Mindful Relationships (unconditional friendliness) \u2022 Mindful Responses (playfulness)",
            "Such a good book! I love the terminology the author uses (red, yellow, and green light communication) as well as the prompts and meditations she gives to help the reader recognize and use the concepts of the book. I\u2019m not really sure why I keep getting these types of thought provoking books on audio because again, having a physical copy of this would be helpful. It was a quick read and not too academic so it was very accessible. I think anyone in a committed relationship (including friendships!) should read this book. I know this book will make a difference in how I communicate and how I perceive the communications of others. ",
            "Five Keys of Mindful Communications by Susuan Gillis ChapmanFive Keys of Mindful Communications by Susan Gillis Chapman is an important must read book for everyone!In the Ms. Chapman's book Five Keys of Mindful Communications she shares with readers impressive strategies that flips the script on the current daily methods of communication people use with the exception being therapists. Five Keys of Mindful Communications illustrates the importance of being a deep listener and hearing what the individual is really attempting to convey and not simply the words being verbally articulated and body language instead listen what the soul/heart is saying.The key philosophy within the book Five Keys of Mindful Communication is from the angle that we need to examine beyond what is displayed in front of us when communicating but go to the root of what drives the words, its background or underlying information being shared. I found The Five Keys of Mindful Communication laced with wonderful techniques and strategies necessary for meaningful non-confrontational, interpersonal communication. While reading the book I recognized how I listen to others. I thought deeply and realized how imperative critical thinking skills are involved for developing and maintaining strong interpersonal relationships. Asking thoughtful questions instead of rushing to defend one's position or perceptions is paramount to comprehending what the person wants you to consider. Being quick to judge or defend one's position and respond to the statements verbalized increase confrontations and ill-feelings. Instead, listen with an open mind and an attitude of honesty can improve relationships. I appreciated Ms. Chapman's use of metaphors and real life examples portrayed through the book which added clarity. Ms. Chapman transports the reader from the looking out for number one mindset to the we-first ideology. Through the application of mindfulness many miscommunications, harsh feelings and prejudices can be eliminated. If as a society we learn how to really listen in a caring manner perhaps stereotypes and unfounded cross cultural ideas would diminish reducing the lost of precious lives. In my opinion and dealing with hundreds of personalities daily The Five Keys of Mindful Communications is so meaningful that it should be required reading for freshmen or students entering high school, college, new staff members joining a company, firm or organization and definitely for couples prior to making a commitment. I wonder how peaceful our world would be if we truly listened and communicated using the five keys of mindfulness instead of concentrating on me-first, selfish frame of thought.I highly recommend reading The Five Keys of Mindful Communication and applying its principles makes a great companion with the highly regarded holy books as a means for living in harmony."

            "This book goes through bad and comes out the other side into INSANELY AWESOME. And then keeps going and ends up at...really, really bad. A convoluted political plot set in an alternate world some Earth people can access is the frame on which the author hangs chapter after chapter of disquisitions on his favorite subject: the natural inferiority of women and their secret desires to be enslaved and raped by strong, strong he-men. There's actually an odd, cockeyed appeal to the scenes in which the hero, Jason--an Earth man who can't quite accept that it's his destiny to enslave pretty heroine Beverly--is basically chased around the room by a panting Beverly demanding he enslave her, enslave her and rape her now!I found this book in a bin somewhere when I was in high school and read it in gaping astonishment. It's still pretty damn amazing. All in all, it reeks of an author who spent a lot of time alone, muttering vile imprecations on the stuck-up hussies who didn't seem to enjoy his manly charms.",
            "That's unfortunate.If you want to write an essay regarding your roles on gender roles in nature and how they may be expressed or denied by society do that. If you wish to write a story about a man on a planet of barbarians and slave women having roguish adventures do that.What was done here is a sort of mash-up of the two. Jolting from scene to scene the main character has unrealistic sex (seriously Stud horses think it's too much) while going on these long narrative tangents about BDSM philosophy. There are interesting ideas a plenty here and some arousing scenes but in terms of structure the novel is a mess. It is even worse on audible since the narrator didn't make minor changes to how he read the book. The dialogue is all he said, she said, he said, she said to the point where it's actually hard to follow what was said. This is especially unfortunate as the narrator did a really good job at differentiating the voices making the dialogue tags unnecessary.It's a naughty thrill of a read that has gained added spice as the philosophies espoused are so deliciously taboo in the modern day (indeed it seems to predict that state of affairs) but it's an obtuse read to say the least. Something best left for late night reading bursts before bed, not a long trip. ",
            "We continue Jason's story, and our newly-freed former slave takes to Gorean life very well, becoming a man about town in Victoria, indulging a hopeless passion for his former Earth acquaintance, and taking revenge upon a few of the former Mistresses from the first book.As we leave this one, he is part of a stunning river battle, the equal of anything George R R Martin could conceive.",
            "This is the second book in a mini-series within the Gor books featuring a new character named Jason Marshall, who is kidnapped from earth and enslaved on Gor.

All that being said, someone stirs in the crowd and says, the Emperor has no clothes! But unlike the story where everyone said, you are right, reviewers opinions are not fact and are vastly different as I have so often noticed on Goodreads. This author can tell a story but his characters are hollow and lack any substance whatsoever. The plot is silly. It's like readings book where things blow up, people run, lives are lost, loyalties are betrayed, and eventually hero and girl succeed . Nice if the journey was significant and the writer had sufficient tools. But fear not, the hero will return in a sequel and those of who who cannot understand how anyone could not like this book will be ready for the follow up. Can you say Transformers 12?"

The protagonist ends up being a kind of Jack Reacher who, in his eagerness to diskette all the corruptela Politics of Wasington, (there is not a single politician, not a single judge, not a single police that is saved) will face his company, The Davies Group, founded by a character that moves all the threads based on keeping all the unconfident secrets of those already mentioned.

The timely debounger serbian that can not be missing in this type of stories. But do not worry, that truth always triumphs. Written, I think, to end as a cinematographic script, it takes two stars because I think the author, if he stops fantasizing as with the present novel, can do it well. It has very good descriptive passages about Washington DC and its political environment, which save total estropicio. As for comparing it with \"The Firm\", by John Grisham, I prefer not to comment, since the laughter's attack that produces me prevents me with due composure.",
            "The 500 has frequently been compared to The Firm. I get it. The villains in both books are shadowy organizations whose all-seeing, all-reaching power require a taffy pull of your disbelief. Where they differ (as best as I recall...it's been 20 years since I read The Firm) is that Michael Ford (the protagonist and narrator of The 500) is no Mitch McDeere (The Firm's hero). Ford, in fact, barely resembles a human based on his motivations and mental faculties under duress. Throughout the book, Ford's repeated pursuit of danger makes no sense. There are several times when he could have just let a matter drop, hang out with his dream girl and enjoy his newfound wealth (Ford's family history is borrowed liberally from the McDeere clan, poverty prison, parental death). In fact, several times the author has Ford saying that he himself can't explain why he's doing something--oh, like walking into a surefire gunfight--that he doesn't need to and which even he doesn't know what outcome he wants to affect by intervening. This happens in the central plot pivot. Quirk, in fact, has the narrator explain that he doesn't know why he's approaching the house even as he's doing it: he has no idea what he hopes to accomplish and no idea if what he's doing will have any positive outcome but DOES know that he's putting himself in serious immediate and long-term danger (the from all-powerful shadow villain organization). The *story* requires that he gets passed some vital information in this encounter before the violent showdown. However Ford didn't *know* he was there to get this informtion. This alien motivation drives many of Ford's actions: he does things for no other (for any logical, human) reason except the plot requires it. If this weren't enough, our hero gets repeatedly beaten, tortured, sliced, stabbed, and contorted and while these are happening, he maintains a narrative tone that can only be classified as flip (or, possibly glib if you were Mr. McDeerefilm version). On at least two occasions, he explains he took some pain killers before he went to the current encounter, you know, just in case his shoulder were to get ripped out of it's socket and his faace stepped on. Who doesn't? Michael Ford isn't Jason Bourne or his ilk--he's a 28-year old guy right out of Harvard Law. No Special Forces training, no Mr. Miyagi, no radioactive spiders. Just a guy.Quirk chose a first-person narration framed in past tense. In terms of the story, I can't really find a reason for telling it in the past tense. Quirk's choice could potentiall provide a narrative distance that enables breezy asides and flip comment during moments of torture and duress. If that were Quirk's choice, then his oh-by-the-way manner of explaining that taking painkillers allow Ford to function after getting his wrist broken and skin flayed seem to kneecap this author's choice. Michael Ford does things humans do, but his decision-making process and pain threshold are alien.All this said, it was a not altogether unpleasant read. Good narrative pace, some interesting back story details...this book's not without its pleasures.",
            "Pass the popcorn, a book that would be better as a moviePromo material for \u201cThe 500\u201d says the novel is now under development as a major motion picture. I\u2019m glad to read that. As written, I think the book would be better as a movie.Tom Cruise would be a natural to play the part of Michael Ford, except Cruise is now too long in the tooth to play the twenty-something hero. I see the book being better as a movie because all the fast action, coincidences that are too pat and dialogue that\u2019s too glib would be more plausible, more pleasurable rushing at you on the big screen. Up there on the screen the story might take off. On the page, the narrative feels a little flat, the banter more often than not, tends toward the flip.The narrative, a story about how Washington power brokers abuse power, too often felt manufactured rather than organic, forced instead of naturally unfolding, constructed by a formula only loosely connected to reality.Michael Ford is a recent Harvard grad who didn\u2019t have an easy life growing up. Now he\u2019s been hired by the Davies Group, Washington\u2019s most prestigious consulting firm, an enterprise operated more as a secret society, a shadow government run by the world\u2019s most powerful and dangerous men. Soon Ford is ensnarled by a past he can\u2019t outrun, caught in circumstances as perilous as anyone could imagine and relentlessly pursued by people obsessively trying to control the future.Ford tells his own story. It\u2019s a story too full of too-fortunate coincidences for my taste: For example, it looks at one point that Ford is trapped in an office with no way to escape. But wait, as a kid he worked as a carpenter so he knows how and where to kick and punch his way through drywall.Later he\u2019s subjected to excruciating torture, enough to force anyone to give up the truth. But wait, just a couple hours ago he happened to take some powerful painkillers. The pain meds help him endure. And then later, it appears his pursuers have him cornered, this time for real. But wait, there\u2019s a new Audi parked at the curb and as Ford suspects, the German automaker has taped a spare ignition key to the back page of the car\u2019s owner\u2019s manual. Off he drives. Neat. A number of dead bodies end up lying around and when it serves the writer\u2019s purposes the bodies stay dead. But if it\u2019s more convenient, a body can and does come back to life.All those quick escapes and neat reversals are fine for the movies, especially one that\u2019s edited for quick cuts and limited attention spans. But readers usually are looking for more substance and nuance, a better reason to care about the characters and what happens to them. All that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s not a good read, exactly. It\u2019s just that I hoped \u201cThe 500\u201d would be better, a story with more depth, more of an emotional core and less occupied with being self-consciously clever.At one point Michael says he felt that fatigue weighed down his body \u201clike a dentist\u2019s lead blanket.\u201d That\u2019s sort of how I felt sometimes while reading the novel.3.5 stars",

They pay off his debt, get him a nice apartment and a huge salary. Best of all, Mike quickly falls for a coworker. Now his life is pretty close to perfect.Unfortunately, just like everything else that's too good to be true, there are a lot of skeletons in The Davies Group's closet...I devoured this book over the better part of a day. Life kept interfering, which is why it took me that long. (Advice: do not start this book unless you have several hours to devote to finishing it.) It's been compared to The Firm, and that's incredibly apt. Like early John Grisham, this is just an incredibly fun novel. It's very suspenseful, and one of the perfect summer reads this year. (I don't know about you, but when the weather turns hot, I want either a frothy novel or something that is incredibly suspenseful.)Also, in an election year, political thrillers are almost mandatory, right?This novel also reminded me of Rosemary's Baby. Obviously there's no satanic cults or devil-babies, but what the two novels do have in common is this huge sense of paranoia. When your enemy could be everywhere (or could have gotten to anyone), who do you trust? Who do you have to help you? And how can you even get help when you don't know if it's a trap?The 500 is one of the most purely fun (but also thought-provoking and clever) novels I've read in a long time. I'm very excited to read whatever Matthew Quirk writes next. Highly recommended.",
            "This would have been a much better read if the \u201cwhy\u201d made more sense. It\u2019s like the main character had nothing better to do and just decided to get to involved in life threatening situations. Pretty decently paced and the plot moved along but after awhile I was just over him and the story. This is the 1st in a series, also a debut book for the author."

            "Marie de France was an aristocratic twelfth-century poet, from whose name we conclude that she was apparently living somewhere other than France when she wrote her most famous works. Probably England: she writes in Anglo-Norman, which is an important language for anyone interested in the history of English because it's the source of so many borrowings. Marie was probably attached to the court of Henry II (who, I need scarcely remind you, was himself French and spoke no English), but apart from that we really know nothing about her except what can be gleaned from her poetry.Now, I really like Old French and Anglo-Norman poetry, but some of the classics are so long that reading them seems pretty daunting. The big Arthurian cycles and the long poems of people like Wace or Chr\u00e9tien de Troyes \u2013 I can only deal with them in small doses. That's why forms like lais and fabliaux are so appealing: short, narrative works, with lots of dirty jokes and direct explanations. These are poems about illegitimate births, exiled knights, chivalrous deeds and hidden love-affairs \u2013 and yet despite all these plot devices, they have very little in common with the kind of adventure romances that would develop later. Here everything is much more direct, and there is a charmingly ingenuous approach to sex and desire in general. This is compounded by the fact that Marie, being female, gives many details about the women involved that male poets so often didn't bother with.My favourite lai is \u2018Bisclavret\u2019, one of the oldest werewolf stories out there. It starts with the sort of attention to linguistic detail that is always guaranteed to win me over:Bisclavret ad nun en bretan,Garwaf l'apelent li Norman.\u2018Bisclavret\u2019 is the Breton name,The Normans call it \u2018werewolf\u2019.The word she uses, garwaf, is the source of modern French garou, and in fact it's cognate with English werewolf although it doesn't look it at first glance. Anyway. I could go on and on about every piece of vocabulary in here, which is sometimes what I do when I read stuff like this. But beside the strong linguistic interest I have for this period, there is also heaps of literary charm and atmosphere.Garvalf, ceo est beste salvage,Tant cum il est en cele rage,Hummes devure, grant mal fait,Es granz forest converse e vait...The werewolf is a savage beast,When that rage comes over him,He devours men, does great evil,Roaming and prowling through the mighty forests....This is one of the few werewolf tales to be told from the point of view of the werewolf, and it's weirdly intriguing to compare it to Norse versions, or indeed to modern treatments like An American Werewolf in London, Angela Carter, Season 3 of Buffy, or whatever you're thinking of. The poetic techniques are of a very high quality and can be analysed and probed to your heart's content, if you like that sort of thing.This particular edition has modern French prose on facing pages, but there are lots of English translations out there too including a good-looking one from the ever-reliable Penguin Classics. Well worth your time if you're in the mood to get your medieval on.",
            "This book contains the 12 poems by Marie de France, an introduction by Glyn Burgess, a translator's note from Keith Busby: a bibliography, an Index of Proper Names, and three of Marie's poems in the original Old French which allows the reader to see that the original poems consisted of short lines, of about 7 or 8 syllables arranged in continuous rhyming couplets.Burgess and Busby have offered a prose translation, which focuses on being as close to the original meaning as possible, and they considered that this makes a more easy reading as Marie's original short sentences are quite staccato. I disagree of course, because I was taught that much of the sense of a poem comes from the structure which adds to the simple word meaning in a multitude of additional ways, for example rhyming couplets in English are often used for comedic effect, or possibly curtness. And line length is also highly relevant in indicating the speed of diction so that certain effects are transmitted by requiring the speaker/presenter to slow or speed up their performance. Nevermind: it would certainly take a very skilled translator to re-create the Old French into a similar poem with the continuous rhyme scheme and tight syllabic structure that Marie has created. You start to appreciate her skill, when you consider this.I did enjoy Professor Burgess's introduction. He covers all the salient points reference the various manuscripts that are in existence today, the difficulties of accurately pinpointing the exact date for the production of Marie's work (last quarter of the 12th century) and of course the difficulty of identifying Marie herself, although he does confirm in his opinion that the writer is indeed a woman. Burgess offers no less than four possible candidates for Marie's real-life personage, and confirms that she must have been a lady of high-birth because of her facility with languages (Latin, Anglo-Norman and Old French) and her knowledge of contemporary and ancient literary texts and styles, as well as her familiarity with courtly life. He concludes that she was probably born in France, but moved to England as a result of marriage or the need to expand her literary fame.The central theme of all the poems or lais is love, and specifically erotic or passionate love between a man and a woman, usually the love takes place between a couple who must break the vows of wedlock, so the two must be resourceful and fight to establish or to continue their love, most often in secret, and it is not simply courtly love, but physical love, as in the union of the two. In some of the lais, for example Yonec and Milun there are offspring.I think the modern reader will be surprised to find that the problems of the lovers are still very much what lovers today find themselves dealing with. Here is an example from Milun, which is the ninth lais:The damsel was full of joy because of the love thus granted to her. Milun and she frequently arranged a meeting in a garden in which she took her ease, close to her bedchamber. Milun visited the damsel so often and loved her so much that she became pregnant. When she realized this, she summoned Milun and bemoaned her fate. She told him what had happened: she had forfeited her honour and good name by allowing such a thing to befall her.It is such an old tale. And what I find interesting is that in most of Marie's lais, often the action is instigated by the woman, and when problems befall the couple, it is often the woman who comes up with a plan, or compromise or some kind of resolution. Marie's women prove to be intelligent, and independent thinkers. The lai of Milun continues with the damsel making plans to conceal the baby with her married sister, and her partner carries out her requirements to the letter.Let us go back to the beginning, the twelve lais are prefaced by a Prologue in which Marie presents the source of her lais and her reasons for writing. She explains that she took the material from the touring Breton musicians, who had turned adventures into songs. Marie says that she chose this material because - and here I present my own interpretation - that is was contemporary and spoke to her. She also reveals a reason which I think explains her focus on love:Anyone wishing to guard against vice should study intently and undertake a demanding task, whereby one can ward off and rid oneself of great suffering. For this reason I began to think of working on some good story and translating a Latin text into French, but this would scarcely have been worthwhile, for others have undertaken a similar task. So I thought of lays which I had heard and did not doubt, for I knew it full well, that they were composed, by those who first began them and put them into circulation, to perpetuate the memory of adventures they had heard. I myself have heard a number of them and do not wish to overlook or neglect them. I have put them into verse, made poems from them and worked on them late into the night.I think this part of the Prologue is very revealing about Marie, and certainly I am not a scholar and no doubt scholars would decrie my womanly intuition but I think it is quite clear that Marie has suffered from a broken heart. It is framed - in the general, but... Anyone wishing to guard against vice... sounds like a secret affair ...can ward off and rid oneself of great suffering. Her second reason: the minstrels songs appeal, is because they are about adventures - of love. She says I thought of lays I did not doubt, for I knew it full well... (my emphasis).Or perhaps the significance of a line break? Medieval writing is renowned for its play with words, the use of double negatives, puns, innuendo, some effects that are easily lost if you translate or change the structure. The Breton love-tales or songs appealed to Marie because she heard them herself and they spoke directly of people the musicians knew about and, quite possibly reminded Marie of her own adventures.Personal speculation aside, however, it does not do to make make light of Marie's subject. She would have been familiar with the troubadour love poems composed at that time in the south of France, Provence, and of the development of Romances. Burgess suggests that Marie's lais fall between them stylistically. Marie was drawn to this material from a personal perspective I suspect, but more importantly, her interest in the genre of Courtly Love, was primarily to do with the fact that it represented an important intellectual development, and quite possibly its very real effect on the re-structuring of society at that time. The social structure was the feudal system, and depending on the region, it covered a period of approximately 500 years between 1000 and 1500 A.D. The feudal system was a power structure with Lords in allegiance to a regional king. The lords governed large areas, and every single person within (the serfs) were owned and in life-servitude to the lord. This power structure was controlled by force - the knights, and through allegiances by marriage, - sanctioned by the Church. In fact marriage was the primary tool by which noble families retained power, formed alliances, and established heirs. Courtly Love reflected a strata of this society, - the Knights, who were essentially second, third, fourth sons etc, who did not have the right to marry, or receive lands through inheritance. These young men of noble birth were trained to fight, but were also educated and looked to ladies of similar status with which to interact. The social dynamics of this situation were directed into formal fighting at jousting tournaments - for the favours of the lady, and the energy of these relations was captured in a new literary development, as already stated, in the love-poems of the troubadours, and Romances, by writers such as Chretien de Troyes, Guillaume de Lorris, and others. Marie's choice of subject, therefore strongly suggests her desire to participate in this dialogue of social re-definement.It is difficult to say whether Literary Works reflect or direct social dynamics but Marie, and her lais were part of an important evolvement of social behaviour which eventually usurped the power structures of the Lords, and their feudal system. In her lais Marie examines a situation or dilemma involving individuals - What do you do for instance, if you love a lady, but have no land, castle, or right to claim land of your own? What if you are a lord married to an upright lady, but are struck by love for another? What if you are a dutiful daughter but do not love the husband chosen for you by family allegiances?Marie questions the traditional values of marriage in relation to love arrangements. In every lai the right of the lovers to seek fulfilment in whatever way they can is supported by Marie. Sometimes, as in Eliduc there is a happy resolution: the wife requests an annulment so that her husband Eliduc can marry his true love. Sometimes the lovers are discovered and die together at the hands of the cuckolded husband, as in Equitan. In another, the lovers are tested to ascertain the loyalty of one for the other as in Milun, but in each lai the poem revolves around the central pair and their ability to sustain or achieve their love. I don't think Marie's lais are significant for their strong narrative style (perhaps the longer ones such as Eliduc, Guigemar, and Lanval), but are instead of significance for the fact that they question the traditional roles offered to men, and women and how they suggest the possibility of an alternative, using the concept of Love. Here is a short extract from Equitan who in this case is a king. He falls in love with his seneschal's wife. The seneschal is a high-ranking retainer, responsible for the administration of the king's lands. Equitan contrives to meet with the wife and confesses his love for her - here is her cautious and diplomatic answer:'My lord,' said the lady, 'I must have time to reflect on this. ... You are a king of great nobility, I am not wealthy enough to be the object of your love or passion. If you had your way with me, I know well and am in no doubt that you would soon abandon me and I should be very much worse off. If it should come about that I loved you and granted your request, our love would not be shared equally. Because you are a powerful king and my husband is your vassal(servant), you would expect, as I see it, to be the lord and master in love as well. 101-36Anyone in doubt that Marie is a woman? The Lady continues in this way for another 20 odd lines, courteous but firm, and concludes that a man who steals away the wife of another does so only because of his high status. Equitan replies:My lady, I beg you. Do not say such things! Such men are not truly courtly (realises he is speaking about himself!) This is the sort of deal struck between merchants who, to acquire wealth or a large fief, expend much effort for some unseemly purpose.(manages to save the situation through flattery, with caveat) Any wise and courtly lady of noble disposition, who sets a high price on her love and is not fickle, deserves to be sought after by a rich prince in his castle, and loved well and loyally, even if her only possession is her mantle. (Suggests - correctly she has nothing to lose except her good name)(... and wins the argument by convincing her -if they are loyal and treat each other as equals then much is possible... which was her suggestion in the first place!)'Do not regard me as your king, but as your vassal and lover. I swear to you in all honesty that I shall do your bidding. Do not let me die because of you. You can be the mistress and I the servant, you the haughty one and I the suppliant.' (I think this is where the lady gives in.)It concludes thus:So long did the king speak with her and so ardently did he beg for mercy that she promised him her love and gave him her body. By an exchange of rings they took possession of each other and pledged their faith. They kept this faith well and loved each other dearly. It was later to be the cause of their death. 137-84 Take note here that Marie intends both or more meanings of the word possession and of course faith, used twice is intended to vye with the more usual, as in religious faith, faith in God, which bespokes a challenge to the authority of the Church.The romance literature, along with Marie, and the troubadour love poems, reflect or possibly have contributed to the massive social evolvement that took place throughout the Middle Ages.",
            "This is the best edition of the Lais de Mar\u00eda de Francia in Castilian.It is an excellent translation of Professor Carlos Alvar, has a multitude of notes that help the study of the work, as well as a simple and complete critical study.Affordable for any audience, it has numerous and extensive bibliography to expand the various topics discussed. In reference to the content of the work, the Lais are short narrations of Breton and courteous environment, set in the fantastic world of Brittany.His reading is pleasant and pleasant, at all repetitive.From my point of view the best of all is Bisclavret.",
            "Love is sore inside the body that never appears to surface. Long time it makes this evil it possesses us, because nature has been legacy. Many do not take it seriously: those rude courtiers who go through the world courting the ladies and boasting what they do. It is not that love, but madness, perversion and libertin. Who finds a loyal love should serve him, love him and obey in all his orders. I have always said that women with great talent have excelled throughout history, although in different ways, and this case is very exemplary: Mar\u00eda de France wrote These Lans probably around 1165, in the middle of average age when in Peru did not even exist the Inca Empire. Product of a merger between the Europe of Cort\u00e9 love and the Celtic legends with its fantastic fairy characters, magicians and charms are born these Lais that come to be a kind of short stories in which Mary simply, elegant and alender transmits us legends that she has heard or she has learned, that she considers should not be forgotten and therefore she shows it to us. The theme is unanimous love, but love courtes as I mentioned, and really this book is a great example of a whole Culture and time in medieval Europe. When the aristocrats, the gentlemen, barons and a long etcetera court the maiden of Alcurnia of the time. The Lais actually despite his great fantasy paint us (and that I loved it) very faithful values, customs and the way to love that time. Of course, the Alcurnia was something very important, the external beauty occupied a first place and the virginity and purity of women as well. Of course, I must say they are practically fairy tales but in them the main thing is love. All Lais tell us about stories of romance but always by dangerous and even sinful situations, the characters suffer for the most part by the desired person (by the friend or friend as they call them), the maidens send to their page so that his beloved knows that he can come to offer him his love and she will be delivered without conditions, there is enough infidelity and actually part of that is the courteous love, the love that men made with women almost always married, who had a husband, but they could Well enjoy your love just with very short interviews or months without spoken. Of these examples this work is full. There are many peculiarities that are typical of the historical moment but still sympathized: the grandilocuent descriptions always present (as a bravest gentleman did not exist or ever, or it was a beautiful maid from which there was no man I did not want to have it), the promises of love and fidelity, maneuvers to always escape from the husband or wife, among others. I also liked to know some medieval traditions typical of the time in which the author lived: the vassalage, the tournaments of gentlemen, the tribute, which was considered suitable for a man at that time, I think all this can illustrate you Many things that history books are sometimes overlooked. Lais is a separate story and certainly can be taken in a playful and fantasy way, some of my favorites were: Eliduc, Lanval and Fresno. Each adventure is worth it and talking about each of them would be too much. There are wolf men (one of the oldest descriptions), Knights of King Arthur, fairy leading to Avalon, betrayals, infidelities and of course love, love of those who conceived as the only important thing in his life. Last and not Less important you can hear very well say: I have read the Lais de Mar\u00eda de France, hehe.",
            "These stories by a 12th Century abbess have everything! Love and treason and a noble betrayed werewolf ... Stephenie Meyer eat your decadent, twinkling little heart out. The English is a little stiff, because it sets out to be very close to the mediaeval French poetry, but the power comes through. Amazing these lais are not more famous. I can't resist one extended quote: 'Lord,' she said, 'please come hunting in the forest in the region where I live. Stay in my husband's castle, be bled there and take a bath on the third day. My husband will be bled and take a bath with you. Make sure you tell him to keep you company. I shall have the bath heated and the two tubs brought in. The water in his bath will be so boiling hot that no mortal man could escape scalding or destruction, before he has settled down in it. When he has been scalded to death, summon your vassals and his. Show them how he suddenly died in the bath.'She is not given a name, so I think of her as Lady Macbath.",
            "There's so much that we don't know about the lais in this volume which we have from the Harley manuscript in the BL: we don't know exactly when they were composed (though sometime in the later 12th century), or in what order, who 'Marie de France' was, and who the king to whom she dedicated them (Henry II?) - we don't even know for sure that she was a woman (though, like other scholars, I'm fairly confident that she was from the content of her poems). What we have are these twelve short tales, originally written in Old French in rhyming couplets, here translated into English prose. All of the stories are of love, but a specific historicised love whose codes are courtly and which revel in the suffering of lovers. Young wives with older, jealous husbands take handsome young knights as lovers, beautiful virginal girls get pregnant by their secret lovers, and adultery is venerated rather than condemned. Some of the most interesting stories feature gender inversions where women take up quests to win passive men (modelled on Cupid and Psyche?) and there are overt intertexts with Ovid's poems where the Remedia Amoris gets name-checked, and where Laustic intersects with Ovid's Philomela.The prose translations are useful but do inevitably disrupt the relationship between form and content: three tales are included in their original Old French and feel different immediately, not least due to the driving rhyming scheme. All the same, this is a helpful introduction to the  lais which circulated in both England and France and offer provocative comparisons with the Arthurian romances as well as Chaucer and later Renaissance women writers such as Marguerite de Navarre. ",
            "Much like this collection of Mais, medieval Breton medieval fables easy to read, sometimes very beautiful, plunging into the heritage and the imagination of a region that I particularly like.",
            "Originally read as assigned in undergrad, but upon re-reading realized that the Lais are much subtler than I had allotted time to appreciate. Good stories of courtly romance and observations about love - as experienced, pursued, and idealized by that particularly chivalric wedge of medieval society."

            "Trigger warning for sexual assault The Broken Crown is the start of a six book epic fantasy series by Canadian author Michelle Sagara West. While The Broken Crown does have some sword fights and so on, the majority of it is political intrigue. It might appeal to the same audience as Game of Thrones, although it is less grimdark and more traditional. However, what really made me love The Broken Crown was the strength and presence of the female characters, of which there are many.The Broken Crown tells of two countries \u2013 the Dominion and the Empire. Most of the page time is spent on the Dominion, which is ruled by a hierarchy of war lords who gain honor on the battle field. But the current ruler of the Dominion is weak, and his war with the Empire was a disaster. Some of the men who vowed to serve him embark on a conspiracy to overthrow him, and caught in the middle of all of this is Diora, a girl who grows up to be the Flower of the Dominion, the most beautiful and graceful woman of all. Yet this is not all, for the Lord of the Night and the demons who serve him have their own plans concerning these affairs\u2026The Dominion is extremely patriarchal. A woman\u2019s place on society is based on who her father is and who she marries. Women have few choices and no legal rights. No woman of the Dominion wields a sword on the battlefield. They have to find power in other ways, such as with Serra Teresa, Diora\u2019s paternal aunt. Serra Teresa is bard born \u2013 her voice has the power to influence or command others, and her song is enchanting. However, to Teresa this is as much a curse as a gift, for it means that she was considered to valuable to be married off and leave the family. Thus Teresa is not able to have control of a husband\u2019s harem and friendships among sister-wives. Diora was born with the same gift and curse, and Serra Teresa will do everything within her power to see that Diora has the life that Teresa was unable to have.\u201cThere are battles that are fought in this world in which no sword is raised.\u201dTeresa and Diora are not action heroines. They do not lift swords or go to battle, but they fight in their own way, with words and gestures. Diora in particular endures immense difficulties, keeping face schooled into a careful mask of politeness. It takes a long time for her to act, but when she does, it is noteworthy. They are not the only female characters of note. The Empire is much more egalitarian, and many of the female characters we see there are involved in military pursuits. The Kalakar, a female general, is a particular favorite of mine. There\u2019s also a girl Chosen One who is likely to become pivotal.I will warn you, the first seventy pages at first appear to have nothing to do with the plot. And for the most part, they are not directly relevant to the events occurring in the rest of the novel although I believe they will become critical in later volumes. However, both passages also involve something that I see as an essential theme of The Broken Crown \u2013 choice. In these pages two women are offered hard, difficult choices for which they are unlikely to be remembered or gain any glory. Yet both accept, knowing that their difficulties have the possibility of leading to gains for humankind. Choice or lack of it underlines all of The Broken Crown. Although I do believe the events of those seventy pages to be important thematically, does it really taken seventy pages to cover this material? Like most epic fantasy books, The Broken Crown is long, measuring out at somewhere over seven hundred pages. For the most part it is slow going, especially in the beginning. I don\u2019t think it really starts to pick up until after page three hundred.I encourage anyone who likes epic fantasy to pick up The Broken Crown, particularly if they are looking for some epic fantasy where women play a large role. It may be long, but I found it ultimately worth the time involved. I certainly intend to read the sequel.Originally posted on The Illustrated Page."

            "Last year, there was a student who sat outside the prep room reading. She read Michelle West, but she had yet to read this series. This is a shame because while the Sun Sword series is sprawling, it is a beautiful work.This book is the first volume in the Sun Sword series and focuses on the shifts of power in a country that resembles an Arabia from the 1001 Nights (yes, I know the Nights are really from India). One of the central characters, Dio, is the most beautiful woman in the world. She also is the favored child of her father and eventually marries the prince of the kingdom, who doesn't deserve her or the kingdom. Her father and his friends have something to say about the kingdom bit.What makes this series worth reading is the type of women that inhabit it. Dio is not a fighter in the traditional sense of the word. She does have a magic, think of it as a siren voice, but does she know how to use a sword, no. Yet, Dio is more of a fighter because of this. She plays the long game, if I may borrow a phrase.This series deserves more popularity than it garners. It is better than any of those big sprawling male written series such as those by Jordon, Goodkind, or Martin. Her books are close to those in length, yet the focus is different. It is not female fantasy, whatever that is, but more of, in a part, of difference in heroes and heroism. In the fantasy books that make the New York Times Bestseller list and become television, there are big epic betters with swords. West has those, but in sharp contrast to those battles, the most heart-wrenching scene in the series occurs in this book when Dio must keep still. She cannot speak. She cannot movie. She must do this because it is the only way for her to win in the end.West's series might be more traditional and genre based, but she presents one of the few books where people, women in particular, are strong in different ways.",
            "\u201cBe careful, Na\u2019dio,\u201d Serena said softly. \u201cRemember that the heart is a dangerous land, and there is not one more painful to have to leave once it is full entered.\u201d This discussion will feature a discussion of sexual violence as well as spoilers. So What\u2019s It About?The Dominion, once divided by savage clan wars, has kept an uneasy peace within its border since that long-ago time when the clan Leonne was gifted with the magic of the Sun Sword and was raised up to reign over the five noble clans. But now treachery strikes at the very heart of the Dominion as two never meant to rule\u2013one a highly skilled General, the other a master of the magical arts\u2013seek to seize the crown by slaughtering all of clan Leonne bloodWhat I ThoughtYou guys! I fucking made it through this book, and I want that to go on both my gravestone and my resume because it quite possibly the most difficult thing I\u2019ve done in my life. I ended up struggling with it so much that I winnowed away at it over the course of several months, but I DID IT. To be fair, this is probably not the most fortuitous introduction, and it\u2019s probably important to mention that I did not hate this book!I didn\u2019t hate it, but it happens to be the most willfully obtuse, irritatingly intricate epic fantasy I\u2019ve ever read. And y\u2019all know that I\u2019m already at something of a Brain Disadvantage with epic fantasies \u2013 I just don\u2019t have a good head for keeping track of thousands of interchangeable nobles who all hate each other for various reasons that are mentioned once and then never again. It felt like there were literally 7,000 various interchangeable men with names like Tyr Fileppo kai di\u2019Ramero wandering around making Portentous Statements at each other, and 90% of my mental faculties were occupied with trying to keep them straight.It also doesn\u2019t help that I am simply not a fan of West\u2019s writing style. There is intricate language, there is purple prose, and then there is whatever you would call her style of writing. The best word I can find to describe it is \u201cponderous\u201d in the extreme. There is just so much to wade through, and the writing alone causes the pace to slow to an absolute crawl. What\u2019s more, people constantly talk circles around each other, making these vague and weighty statements and leaving you to sift through the dialogue to figure out what\u2019s actually going on. Between the writing style, the pacing and the massive number of boring characters and shifting allegiances to keep track of I found that I could only read a little bit of the book at a time without getting overwhelmed.The F WordIt\u2019s a shame that I found so many things about the book offputting, because I do genuinely believe West has a great, compelling to story to tell here! It just gets lost in the way that it is conveyed. This is very much a story of direct power vs. indirect power in a richly-realized non-Western fantasy setting, and it discusses the ways that power is masculinized and feminized. In the Dominion, women are little more than ornamental sex objects to collect and have decorate your harem, and West has many interesting reflections to offer on what it would be like for a woman to exist within such a powerless position but nevertheless continue to fight and find meaning in her life where she can. This is essentially Diora\u2019s story \u2013 she is told again and again that she should not develop any kind of attachments because they will simply be turned against her and used against her in the ruthless political landscape of the Dominion, where a woman is a disposable object and may be set aside or killed on a whim: The desire to be loved\u2014it is a false desire, a madness, a weakness. If you let it, it will control your life, and it will lead you down roads, in the end, that even the damned don\u2019t travel.Sold away to an influential but brutal husband, Diora nevertheless opens her heart to the women of her harem and finds love, meaning and sisterhood with them. To be honest this is the only happy part of the book and it is quickly ripped away when Diora\u2019s father murders the husband\u2019s entire household in a coup. Diora, possessing only indirect power, has no way of stopping this from happening and must find out how to live in the world after losing the only people who loved her and treated her with goodness \u2013 especially now that she must return to the household of the man who stole everything away from her. She must not grieve, cannot show that she has been wounded, is mandated to continue being the perfect, beautiful woman that she always has been. But beneath the still waters she has decided that she will use her position of visibility to make a statement to the men who think they can take whatever they want with no repercussions. She is not a warrior, and most would consider her little more than a pretty ornament, but she nevertheless devotes the rest of her life to fighting back against the men who view women\u2019s lives as entirely disposable in their pursuit of power: Threaten things loved, and a woman might buckle in terror, fold, and give in to any demand until such a time as she might come upon the means to end the threat permanently. But destroy those things, and you destroyed the life, if not the living, of the woman who so loved. Living ghosts were always dangerous.I have seen other readers argue that this book is simply too full of violence against women and that only Diora is exempt from it because she is the special protagonist, and I can understand that perspective. A shocking number of women die and experience sexual violence in this book, and I do certainly object to lots of violence against women in fantasy novels, but much more so if the author uses it cheaply and exploitatively. In this case I do think that the violence happens because West has something meaningful to say about the functions and mores of power and oppression and how people may try to find agency within those functions and mores. That doesn\u2019t necessarily make it easier to read, however!There are other parts to the story, certainly, as it is a sprawling epic fantasy \u2013 the demons are plotting something, and demonspawn Kiriel appears to be central to their nefarious goals, while the coup in the Dominion may be only the beginning of the blood shed over the throne. However I\u2019d argue that Diora\u2019s story is truly what is at the heart of this book, and that\u2019s why I\u2019ve given it the most attention here. If I knew what I was getting myself into with this book from the start I might honestly not have read it, but I\u2019m pretty proud that I did and I don\u2019t exactly regret it either.",
            "This series was really gorgeous. I found the first book a little difficult to follow early on, as the author starts the book with a few chapters that seem entirely unrelated to the rest of the story. The switch back and forth between perspectives of characters in vastly different cultures can also be jarring. The ending of the first book was so powerful however, that it more than made up for the rocky start. The writing was beautiful, the world fascinating, and the women in the book were amazing. Princesses in desert communities struggling to survive and find power within their very defined powerless social class, a street child and her gang of street children who've been adopted into one of the warring noble house, a mysterious powerful girl who hasn't found her destiny or her place in the world...the story forces hard choices on the characters, and they do the best they can. A war between the Southern desert people and the northern Feudal society, with each side being manipulated by demons with their own agenda. It's a long, complicated series and definitely worth a read.",
            "Time of death: 12% (100 pages)I don't remember the names of anyone I've met so far and I'm not interested enough to be reminded. I really, really wanted to love this book, and I think it will likely be incredibly epic, but this far along we still have no forward momentum and no explanations for any of the key ideas. So, while I might try again in the future, it's time to pull the plug.My major takeaway so far:-This world is very complex. I think that once things fall into place, it will be very satisfying and layered.-Heavily influenced by other epics. The world is quite well structured, but the foundation is mortared with tropes that go un-examined (at least in the first 100 pages). The gender essentialism was irritating in particular, since we see women in power and exalted status but are told they are inferior.-Burying the lede. I'd say this book so far has been full of red herrings, except they're not red. They're normal herrings. Inconsequential tangents and actions in minute detail are laid out with some ominous or dramatic conclusion I can't make heads or tails of because I'm still trying to figure out why this scarred table was mentioned so many times but nobody mentioned, I don't know, that demons are real. I guess I am just not sophisticated enough to appreciate the details.In effect, I think this suffers from Malazan syndrome. If you like that series, omg. You are going to lose your ding dang minds over this book, I think. I, however, am not prepared to fight prose that manually right now.CONTENT WARNING: (a list of topics only)  abuse of children and infants, rape, slavery and sexual slavery ",
            "There are a lot of things I liked about this book. I can be seduced by sprawling fantasies (more so if they're not a quest narrative), strange lands with political intrigues, magic that is secondary to politics but not irrelevant, and interesting gender politics. The Broken Crown has that, in abundance. And yet, at the same time, I don't know if I'm running right out to get the next one. I haven't quite been convinced to add Michelle West to my list of authors I need to follow fervently. That might happen eventually, and I'm certainly happy to read more in this world, or more of her books, but I have not yet hit the point where a switch is flipped and I become evangelical.Note: The rest of this review has been withheld due to the changes in Goodreads policy and enforcement.

Historically, Jews in America, whether participating in or refraining from recognizing Christmas, have devised a multitude of unique strategies to respond to the holiday season. Their response is a mixed one: do we participate, try to ignore the holiday entirely, or create our own traditions and make the season an enjoyable time? This book, the first on the subject of Jews and Christmas in the United States, portrays how Jews are shaping the public and private character of Christmas by transforming December into a joyous holiday season belonging to all Americans.Creative and innovative in approaching the holiday season, these responses range from composing America\u2019s most beloved Christmas songs, transforming Hanukkah into the Jewish Christmas, creating a national Jewish tradition of patronizing Chinese restaurants and comedy shows on Christmas Eve, volunteering at shelters and soup kitchens on Christmas Day, dressing up as Santa Claus to spread good cheer, campaigning to institute Hanukkah postal stamps, and blending holiday traditions into an interfaith hybrid celebration called \u201cChrismukkah\u201d or creating a secularized holiday such as Festivus.Through these venerated traditions and alternative Christmastime rituals, Jews publicly assert and proudly proclaim their Jewish and American identities to fashion a universally shared message of joy and hope for the holiday season.

            "It bears repeating once again that Jews react with hostility to the idea that Israel should not have a Jewish ethnocultural core while they have led the campaign against the idea that America and the West have any ethnocultural core. As with their promoting non-White, non-Christian immigration, their advocacy has nothing to do with ideals of moral universalism but everything to do with pursuing what\u2019s good for the Jews, motivated by Jewish hatreds toward the traditional people and cultures of the West. The war on Christmas is thus a central example of the theme of Jews as a hostile elite.\u2193Kevin MacDonald:A new book, Joshua Eli Plaut\u2019s A Kosher Christmas: \u2019Tis the Season to Be Jewish, documents what we have known all along: The Jews did indeed subvert Christmas. This book deserves a full review, but Ethan Schwartz\u2019s summary and comment (\u201cTwas the night after Christmas\u201c) deserve scrutiny. First the summary:Jews have been the vanguard of an effort to \u201ctransform Christmastime into a holiday season belonging to all Americans,\u201d without religious exclusivity. The most important Jewish mechanisms of secularization are comedy and parody, for laughter undermines religious awe. Take, for example, Hanukkah Harry from \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d, who heroically steps in for a bedridden Santa by delivering presents from a cart pulled by donkeys named Moishe, Hershel, and Shlomo. Remarkably, Hanukkah Harry has emerged as a real Santa-alternative for many American Jews. Plaut sees such things not as attempts at assimilation but as an intentional subversion of Christmas traditions. \u201cThrough these parodies,\u201d he writes, \u201cJews could envision not having to be captivated by the allure of ubiquitous Christmas symbols.\u201d And it isn\u2019t just Jews: for Americans in general, Jewish parody helps ensure that Christmas \u201cnot be taken too seriously\u201d and that the celebrations of other traditions \u201cbe accorded equal respect and opportunity.\u201dThere seem to be two messages here. One is the message of subversion utilizing ridicule among other methods. The other is that Jews are seen as high-mindedly making Christmas \u201cinto a holiday season belonging to all Americans.\u201d The end result is that Christmas is not \u201ctaken too seriously\u201d and the Christian religious aspect central to the traditional holiday is de-emphasized.People who take their religion seriously do not allow their religion to be ridiculed. One need only think of the Muslim reactions to cartoons ridiculing Mohammed. The fact that Jews have been able to ridicule Christianity without any serious negative consequences is an important marker of Jewish power and an equally strong indication of the decline of Christian religious belief. I suspect that the organized Jewish community would react in outrage if non-Jews ridiculed religious Judaism. Indeed, any criticism of Jews as Jews is off limits in the mainstream media. (A topical short list of verboten topics: the loyalties of neocon Jews and their role in promoting the war in Iraq, the Jewish aspect of the Ivy League admissions scandal, how Jewish control of Hollywood influences media content.)Schwartz doesn\u2019t quarrel with Plaut\u2019s evidence, but wonders if it\u2019s good for the Jews that such a book be written:There is something disconcerting about this thesis, summoning up classic anti-Semitic images of conspiracy and sabotage. Without a trace of irony, Plaut recounts incidents in which fundamentalist Christian groups complained that \u201ccertain Americans, particularly Jews, were trying to take the \u2018Christ\u2019 out of Christmas.\u201d He adds that \u201canti-Semitic comments often ensued.\u201d Those Christian fundamentalists might well feel vindicated by Plaut\u2019s argument, yet Plaut is unfazed by this connection, and rightly so. It is not inherently anti-Christian, he recognizes, to oppose Christianity\u2019s domination of a secular democracy. If Jews have helped to make American society more open, they should be proud of it.So Jews subverted Christmas but their motives were pure and idealistic. But such an account ignores the Jewish role in conceptualizing America as a proposition nation\u2014a major topic of The Culture of Critique. The Jewish stress on cultural pluralism (which has now morphed into multiculturalism) was an explicit rejection of the ethnocultural strand of American identity, an important part of which was Christianity. (Indeed, until the recent wave of immigration resulting from the 1965 law, Jews constituting 2-3 percent of the population, were the only identifiable American group that was not Christian.) Jews were central to building a wall between religion and the public square which has resulted in the \u201cwar on Christmas\u201d that we still see raging. Jews were also central to changing U.S. immigration policy to be open to all the peoples of the world, again with an ideology that America is merely a set of abstract principles and has no ethnic or cultural core, therefore it should be open to all peoples and these peoples should be able to retain their own culture as part of the American mosaic.I realize that many good people shy away from saying it, but the reality is that Jews have very aggressively pursued policies that benefit them and are opposed to the interests of the traditional people of America and the West. And because Jews attained status as an intellectual and media elite, they have been able to have a very large effect on public policy and even on the attitudes of non-Jews.Plaut emphasizes the difference between the very aggressive behavior of Eastern European immigrants with their hatred of Christianity contrasted with the German Jews who arrived in the mid-19th century and \u201cembraced the holiday.\u201d It\u2019s an important distinction, at least in the American context. But in any case, Plaut\u2019s description of the motives of the Eastern European as stemming from their hatred of Christianity hardly paints them as idealistic crusaders on behalf of an open society. It bears repeating once again that Jews react with hostility to the idea that Israel should not have a Jewish ethnocultural core while they have led the campaign against the idea that America and the West have any ethnocultural core. As with their promoting non-White, non-Christian immigration, their advocacy has nothing to do with ideals of moral universalism but everything to do with pursuing what\u2019s good for the Jews, motivated by Jewish hatreds toward the traditional people and cultures of the West. The war on Christmas is thus a central example of the theme of Jews as a hostile elite.",

            "An elegantly written piece that tells of Buffalo Bird Girl, Waheenee-nea, one of the last Hidatsa people to live the traditional way. It begins by informing us how Buffalo Bird Girl has lost many family members, including her mother and brother, to the small pox epidemic, therefore, her grandmother and aunts took her in and loved her like they were her own mother. The story then progresses forward to show all of the traditional ways of the Hidatsa, such as: collecting and preserving food, moving homes during different seasons, and warring with other tribes until the white man\u2019s influence started impacting their lives and forcing the Hidatsa tribe to move to a reservation.Appropriate for grades 5-8, the author has taken multiple components and flawlessly melded them together to tell an eloquent recount of Buffalo Bird Girl\u2019s life. There are quotes directly from Buffalo Bird Girl who shared her experiences with an anthropologist back in the early 1900\u2019s, as well as the author\u2019s own added text, based on Buffalo Bird Girl\u2019s reminiscing, of how Buffalo Bird Girl\u2019s life was as a child. Furthermore, there are authentic pictures of American Indians as they performed their traditions in the early 1900\u2019s. Finally, there are exquisite illustrations that help convey the information in the text.

I saw this and I did not bother reading it to the nephew as I knew he couldn\u2019t sit through something like this.It is a well told story. I, as an adult, enjoyed it. It tells the story of Buffalo Bird Girl who was a real person and was old in 1912. She was a Hidatsa Indian. There are plenty of illustrated pictures and interspersed with those are actual photos of Indians doing things the story spoke of and it said \u2018this is what Buffalo Bird Girl would have looked like\u2019. I thought that was a nice touch.We get to see how they lived and survived and the troubles they had. The Lakota peoples constantly raided them and attacked them. Winter was harsh and growing food was everything. I find it so strange how separated men and women were in society. They did not eat as whole families, but men ate together and women and children ate together. Most everything was separated. It\u2019s so strange to my modern sensibilities. I learned a lot and I thought it was a good book, but I can\u2019t see it being a book most children enjoy reading in that age range. ",

Relying on the childhood experiences of Buffalo Bird Girl, who was born in the 1830s and who told her stories to anthropologist Gilbert Wilson who recorded them, thus preserving vestiges of the traditional life Buffalo Bird Girl had lived, the author/illustrator describes how she spent each day, the gathering and preparation of food, times of celebration, and times of conflict, and how her people coped with the change of seasons and their forced move to a reservation. There is a poignancy about the stories but also genuine respect for the way of life being described here.

The story intertwines real photographs with historical information in the story. It is a very informational book about the members of the the Hidatsa People. This book would not really work as a read aloud but more broken down into into informational chunks and discussions.",

            "Rounding up from two and a half stars. I liked this, but not as much as I wanted to. The mixture of paintings, photographs, quotes from the real Buffalo Bird Woman, and retelling of her story sometimes works and sometimes doesn't. Some of the illustrations are amazing, but too many are perfunctory. The quotes enhance the book overall, but sometimes they felt jarringly out of place. I am glad they did not skip over some of the darker aspects of the story, but sometimes I felt like they were awkwardly trying to soften the blow: The white people brought small pox, but they didn't do it on purpose we are told. This isn't really a story, but it's not really a history either. I was interested, but ultimately a little dissatisfied."

            "Huge disappointment.I came across Kobo Abe by way of Hiroshi Teshigahara\u2019s screen adaptation of \u2018The Woman in the Dunes,\u2019 as well as \u2018Pitfall,\u2019 both of which I regard as masterpieces of Japanese cinema, on par with the films of Kurosawa and the other Japanese greats. This was my first Kobo Abe novel.The premise is very compelling. Not so the execution. I found the prose so impenetrably dull and repetitive that my trying to stay focused to follow the narrator\u2019s train of thought was quite excruciating. Poignant insights or thought-provoking ideas are either few and far between, or else well disguised, locked within closed loops of quasi-philosophical non sequiturs\u2014ostensibly the protagonist\u2019s jotted-down musings on such themes as identity, alienation, and sexual desire\u2014which make up the bulk of the novel. Maybe there is profound insight and meaning to be had from some of those passages. Then again, maybe not. Actually, it doesn\u2019t matter. For me, a piece of well-wrought fiction conveys its meaning on many levels, and can be appreciated without being \u2018understood\u2019 (whatever that means). With a prose that is clunky, circuitous, riddled with inane similes (e.g. \u2018a wretched feeling, like wearing wet socks\u2019) and makes use of the phrase \u2018in heaven\u2019s name\u2019 on every other page, \u2018The Face of Another\u2019 is just poor craftsmanship. Simple as that.I fail to see why anyone would want to wade through this heap of literary refuse in search of a few (perhaps) well-hidden nuggets of philosophical insight. ",

            "This is, neither more nor less, being in a Collkobo Abe is a writer who pleases me noticeably. I admire a lot to write about him. This is the third book after having read the collection of stories \"the sinister stories\" and another of the most well-known novels, \"Secret Encounters\". But in this case, I must admit that it cost me a lot to finish the book. Perhaps this has occurred by the desenous reflective prose and existentialist questions of the main character. The novel is composed of three long chapters divided into white, black and gray, black and gray plus a letter written by his wife. In the first notebook We are with an enlarged description of the accident by which this man has lost his face from an accident after an explosion with liquid oxygen, subsequently the attempt to make a mask in order to be able to show in public again and finally the development of his interaction With society. Reflections are so many and so complex that they do not respond to one to be able to elaborate a simple review. This character is overwhelmed by the event that leads him to use bandages to cover that \"nest of leeches\" as he calls on the deformed face of him. It is undoubtedly connecting with Kafka. At times, the character is in a situation of vulnerability and deseperating remoteness with the people who interact. It is frustrated and externalizes it with each person who is and what is worse for his problem, he does not manage to make contact, he feels alienated and with a desire to be understood. There when he manages to design a very real features mask It begins to define it as an entity with its own autonomy. In fact he talks about the mask in third person, as his outside another character. In general lines, I liked but just that and it costs a lot to find forceful phrases, of those that make him think of one. Once his comparison with the creature From Frankenstein is the one that resembles the feeling that goes through when some characters can see their destroyed face. Rejection and compassion argue as close to the possibility of seeing it without the bandages of it. I did not read \"the sand woman\", nor \"the man box\" or \"the calcined map\". I hope that these novels resemble more to the books that most fell me to this author. And anyway, Kobo Abe remains \"Japanese Kafka\" and one of the most original writers who have had the pleasure of discovering and reading.",
            "The Face of Another 1964 \u2013 \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u201cWe are what we pretend to be, so we must be careful about what we pretend to be\u201d (Kurt Vonnegut). After enjoying The Woman in the Dunes 1962 over the summer, I have now read The Face of Another by the same author (translated from the Japanese by E. Dale Saunders). In this story, which is narrated through three notebooks (diaries), we are told of a scientist who gets facially disfigured while conducting an experiment in a laboratory, and struggles from then on to fit into the society with his disfigured face. He manages to make a mask that is indistinguishable from a real face, but soon finds out that his problems have only just began as his personality also starts to change. There is something from Frankenstein 1823 in this novel, something from Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde 1886, something from The Invisible Man 1897, something from Steppenwolf 1927, and something from Franz Kafka and Ernesto Sabato as well, resulting in this novel being a psychologically and philosophically delicious journey into the dark recesses of one increasingly damaged mind. There are a number of ways to write a review of this book because there are a number of interpretations one can focus on. I will emphasize in this review the link between the face and identity, and the resulting psychology and existential crisis. In The Face of Another, the main character (the scientist) learns fast after his lab accident that one\u2019s presentable face is essential for societal acceptance. His face is so horribly disfigured that he has to bandage it and then go out into the world, with the result being that people stare at him and feel embarrassed. The scientist also realises that one\u2019s face provides a special key to one\u2019s identity. By losing his face, the narrator feels like he lost something very important \u2013 not only the means to make normal communication with the outside world possible, but also some path through which he can see himself, who he really is and connect with himself (perhaps, with his mental image of himself). We become aware of the ensuing existential crisis of the narrator through three notebooks which he left behind. In them, he hints at some terrible act that he has committed, but we as yet know nothing about, and at his dissatisfaction with the societal response to his disfigurement. \u201cShut off by a wall of affability, I was always completely alone\u201d 1964: 10 and \u201cyet it was not I who should feel ashamed. If there was anyone who should suffer, was it not rather the world that had buried me alive, that made no attempt to recognise a man\u2019s personality without the passport of the face?\u201d 1964: 98, writes our narrator in one of his notebooks.The narrator of the notebooks (the scientist) then makes a decision to make a mask which is indistinguishable from a real face to begin a new life as an acceptable member of society. Since the narrator is a scientist, he approaches every problem with an analytical mind. He consults an expert in cosmetic surgery, as well as an expert in palaeontology, finding out that facial movements and wrinkles would be the hardest to replicate in any artificial face. When our narrator finishes his mask, that would make him finally a normal human being in the eyes of many, and then tries it on, he is not sure if its effects are as desirable anymore. At this point, The Face of Another plays interestingly with an ancient notion that states that a man is capable of anything provided that he wears a mask. The idea here is that when a person veils his identity, he is capable of thoughts and actions his normal self would not even dream of. In this sense, Kobo Abe explores in The Face of Another a situation whereby a mask provides one with special liberation and empowerment, changing the wearer\u2019s personality, making him do strange things. After all, the majority of public actions are only being restrained or propelled by societal expectations \u2013 they should reflect those expectations and we act accordingly.The great aspect of the novel is that we do not quite know what to expect from the narrator or where his new transformation would take him. At the start, we do not even know the nature of an incident that led to his disfigurement because the scientist in his journal chooses to focus on the room that he started to rent and on his laboratory work, rather than on what we really want to know \u2013 what horrible thing did the narrator apparently commit? This focus on insignificant things makes for an intriguing read since we have no choice but to fill the gaps in knowledge with our own horrifying conclusions. Also, like in The Woman in the Dunes, there is a big contrast in The Face of Another between the relative calm of the beginning and the chaotic, almost insane, realisations coming to us readers seemingly from nowhere in the novel\u2019s second part. Near the end of The Face of Another, one very interesting psychological situation occurs involving the wife of the scientist, who has also struggled throughout the story to come to terms with her husband\u2019s transformation. Despite the novel\u2019s slightly rambling and repetitive nature, its conclusion feels strangely right and elegant.The Face of Another would be a delightful book for those who like introspective books which focus on the mind of a main character thrown into an extraordinary situation. The book is a psychologically intense character study of a man grappling with the realities of his facial disfigurement (stigma and alienation), as well as with the realities of his newly found, even if artificially-constructed, identity.",

I was already a big fan of books about UFOS, Sasquatch, etc. and had discovered Charles Fort through a stroke of luck. But the very cool thing about this book is that along with those topics it also focused on Americana and folklore, which I found fascinating. A wonderful book to give a child.Post a Bedtime re-read - and still a very entertaining book and one I will keep in my collection as I work on the great purge! Cohen has a very wise style, neither preying on youthful gullibility, nor reducing everything to dull, rationalistic explanations. In fact, Cohen does a good job of subtly nudging the young reader into considering how they think about strange topics like those touched on here."

            "Read this entire series as a kid. Loved them all. Plan to reread this year!",
            "Found this and the next two in the series in my closet (I must have got them when I was a kid, I vaguely remember reading the first two) and decided to give it a read through before I sold it at the used bookstore. Verdict: well-researched, badly written. The horse-related info is good--it's very nice to see Monty Roberts' techniques used and acknowledged. For that reason alone I might have liked this book if everything else hadn't been awful. The only other thing that interested me, Amy's relationship with her sister, wasn't enough to keep me from wanting to throw this book into the wall, or stop reading it at like page 80. (I did the latter.) Basically, the characterizations, plots, and writing, are all really, really simplistic and predicable. Well beyond what I at least would expect from a mid-grade sort of book, which I'm guessing this is. (Also, there's a character who the author keeps going back and forth on calling Grandpa or using his FULL name. It's weird. He could have just been Grandpa and/or Jack sometimes as well, the last name makes it seem like he's some unknown throughout the whole book.) But what annoyed me most was that all the characters are apparently epically stupid. Sometimes it seems intentional, and is acknowledged--even then it's annoying, but...really, it's just ridiculous throughout the book. I won't get into every case, but the worst concerns what happens to Amy's mother (not really a spoiler as the back cover gives it away) because there were blinkin' OBVIOUS ways around what happened. For one, simply feed the abandoned horse in the barn/shed where he is and wait out the storm there. No need to bring the trailer at all, or if they did no reason to drive back in the storm. They could have fed him there and come back with the trailer in the morning. The horse is said to be in good condition and there's nothing mentioned about hazards where he is, so WHY NOT? (Why didn't the author, say, give the horse a medical emergency? That would have made Amy's mom look like less of a moron for putting him in the trailer and trying to drive in a severe storm.)I also find it a bit weird that in a non-emergency situation (which this was) Amy's mom would simply take a horse (one she suspects is stolen no less) off someone else's property--abandoned or not--without so much as calling whatever people she knows at the police department. ",
            " Coming Home is the first book to the Heartland novels series, written by Lauren Brooke. A 14 year old girl named Amy has a huge passion for horses. With her mother\u2019s help, she is learning skills on how to take more care of horses and how to \u201chorse whisper\u201d while also giving her attention to the other farm animals at Heartland, a sanctuary for horse that have been exposed to emotional and physical harm. But when her mother is killed in a terrible trailer accident, Amy has to grow up quickly, and notices how drastically her world is changing.  Out of all of the four books by far this is my favorite. The author wrote it so well that while reading it you feel like you apart of the story. Her detailing of the situations or the characters are just so realistic. I saw how caught up into the book I got and I realized myself not being able to put it down. This is a wonderful book to read, it\u2019s a great length, it keeps you engaged , I can tell you there will not be a moment while reading this book that you get bored. This book is great for all age groups and for anyone who is as much as an animal lover as myself. I hope when you pick up this book and start reading it you will enjoy all the aspects that the author has to offer.",
            "Put this down 1 star since I first read it a few years ago, because Amy's emotions didn't annoy me as much back then, but I still really enjoyed it. I recently went on a horse trek after not riding a horse for years and it's put me back in horsey mode :p Not good. I'm happy I read this book though. The heart feels - both happy and sad and angry. Is it weird how I think Scott likes Lou and Ty likes Amy? I kind of like Matt though. He seems sweet. But then again so does Ty :p I was so sad when Marion died :( And then Sugarfoot got sick, and the horse was locked in the barn, and Mrs Bell died. So much sad. But then anger when Lou kept losing it with Amy. I mean, Amy was quite self-centered just thinking about herself all the time, but her mum did just die, so I understand. Pleased that I own the first 8 books in the series. I'll definitely be reading them.",
            "So, I might be a little obsessed with the Canadian TV show based on this series, so of course I had to give the books a try as well. There are definitely a few differences so far, but the show has the same heart as the books do, for sure. I enjoyed it, and I'll probably read more of these at some point. ",

But when they headed back, an accident happens\u2026Lauren Brooke writes about horses. Also in her books, there would always be a problem during that, she makes it exciting. I like the book because the problem hooks me in. Also there would be a happy ending.

Aesthetic understanding is inseparable from a sense of detail and style, from which the appropriate, the expressive, the beautiful, and the proportionate take their meaning. Scruton provides incisive critiques of the romantic, functionalist, and rationalist theories of design, and of the Freudian, Marxist, and semiological approaches to aesthetic value.,In a new introduction, Scruton discusses how his ideas have developed since the book's original publication thirty years ago, and he assesses the continuing relevance of his argument for the twenty-first century.",

            "The main character in the book Between heaven and earth is David Juior. I decided to read this book because mum gave me a selection of books to choose from and this book stood out for me because it had an intersting title and has two climbers in the background. This book fits on to a book recommended by a member of your family on the bingo board.I think this is a good catergory to have on the bingo board because your family has a big part in what you read. A character I found intersing was Doris because she is a old lady who is wise and werid. Through the journey up the hill she makes everyone stop from going ahead. That might have been the thing that got David to the top because if David kept going fast he mightnt have enough energy for the last day. until the ashes were sprinkled, it was like he was still here with me. But that was wrong. He will always be with me. That was my favourite Quote because it shows that family will always say with you forever and is the most imporant thing in your life. I thought more deeply about keeping my family safe and together.",
            "This story was an incredibly quick read but no less enjoyable because of it. The premise of the series (written by 7 different authors) is that the family Grandfather, much loved, has died and left 7 'missions' to his 7 grandchildren. In the first of the series it falls to 18 year-old DJ to climb Mt Kilimanjaro and scatter his ashes at the top. DJ is likable but way overconfident which leads to many of the obstacles and tribulations in the story. It is very clearly written from experience, the descriptions of the climb and culture are so vivid you can almost taste it yourself.I think what I loved about this most is I saw how a person who travels around the world can take their experiences and turn them into books like this, books with a bit of fiction, a lot of heart, and a way of getting others to think about getting out and doing their own adventures. In travel you learn something about yourself and I think the book shows that beautifully.",

            "incredible and exciting book, about a young man named dj, his grandfather put him on a mission to get to the one spot between heaven and earth.",
            "The premise is a good one. As a result of a grandfather's will, seven grandchildren are each assigned a task to complete. In this first one in the series, DJ is to climb Mt. Kilimanjaro. He begins as a rather callow young man and ultimately achieves a level of maturity and compassion. As an adventure story for young readers, it works. What it lacks in depth, it offers in lessons about pushing one's limits. DJ puts his climbing companions at risk in his determination to reach the summit so I couldn't really pat him on the back at the end.",
            "tOrca Book introduces a new series called Seven the Series. Between Heaven and Earth is the first installment in this series. Similar to the 39 Clues series, each installment features a different author and a different adventure. When David Junior\u2019s (DJ\u2019s) grandfather dies he leaves to each grandchild a complete adventure/quest. DJ\u2019s quest is to scale Mount Kilimanjaro and spread his grandfather\u2019s ashes off the summit. Obviously, this is no easy task and the athletic, though arrogant, DJ has many physical and mental obstacles to overcome along the way. tThis series is aimed at reluctant middle grade(5-8) readers . Male readers will appreciate the action and the small inclusions of boy humor. The action is fast-paced enough to engage reluctant readers. The characters are not especially well developed and the dialogue is clich\u00e9 ridden, but this type of series will attract a readership. Fans of The Maze of Bones series will enjoy this slightly grown-up version of a quest story. Between Heaven and Earth",
            "2020: Rereading this book had been an absolute pleasure. I remembered the main events, but it was really the small details that made this book so unique. 2016: I first heard about the Seven Series after I invited one of its authors (Sigmund Brouwer) to speak to the school I am currently teaching at. The premise is quite interesting...a grandfather dies, and in his will he gives a letter describing a task for each of his seven grandsons to complete. Seven authors each write one of the grandsons stories. In this book, Between Heaven and Earth, the story focuses on the oldest grandson, 17 year old DJ. The grandfather has asked DJ to climb Mount Kilimanjaro and spread the grandfather's ashes at the summit. When DJ first starts out, his goal is to get up and back down the mountain as quickly as possible. However, he quickly learns that he must slow down in order to get ahead. Various obstacles lie in his way of succeeding. This was a very quick and enjoyable read. Through DJ's adventure, we learn more about him as well as his grandfather. I am very interested to see how the other 6 stories give more glimpses into the grandfather's life. Well done!!",
            "Orca's The Seven Series gives us seven authors each writing the story of one of David McLean's grandsons. During the reading of David's will, four of his daughters and six of his grandsons learn that David left letters instructing each grandson to complete a task. At the same time, they learn there was another daughter and another grandson. This book follows the oldest grandson, DJ, as he journeys from Toronto to Tanzania and attempts to summit Mount Kilimanjaro. There DJ is to scatter some of his grandfather's ashes which are stored in the handle of David's cane. DJ is likeable but overly confident, he expects to take just two days to summit the mountain and another to descend. There is lots of action and good information about how conditions at high altitudes affect the human body. I appreciated the story line about females not being able to work as porter and the young girl who wormed her way into such a position for the climb. DJ experiences loneliness, despair, and exhileration, all within a few days. A great read!"

            "Mathematics: an Illustrated History of Numbers is what it says it is. I somewhat realize that I say that a lot, but generally if you can judge a book by its cover that is considered a good thing, though only when it comes to books. So the book seems to be part of a series called Ponderables. I don\u2019t think I have read any of the other books in the series, but I suppose it is worth pointing out. Since the book is Illustrated there are images and pictures that represent the ideas listed in the book.The book is organized chronologically. It starts with the ideas of Learning to Count, Positional Notation, the Abacus, and so on. Each idea is treated to a paragraph or some other bit of coverage that demonstrates its importance. Some ideas get more coverage or a longer entry. Take the idea of the Pythagorean Theorem. Since it did not exactly originate from Pythagoras, one may wonder how it became named after him. According to the book, he was probably the first one to demonstrate a proof of it. Meanwhile, other entries might only be around half a page in length. This does not necessarily show that this entry is of less importance. Take the entry on the Rhind Papyrus. It is half a page in length, shows a picture of it, and talks about what it contains.Further on in the book it eventually gets to The Renaissance and beyond. This book is pretty simplistic, but that doesn\u2019t make it bad. It explains some things in a way that seems to skip over some information, but it is difficult to really go through it that much.",

So I was excited when I received a copy of \u201cMathematics: An Illustrated History of Numbers.\u201dThe coffee-table book is more than 100 pages and features various illustrations, pictures, charts and graphics. Following an introduction, it\u2019s divided into four sections based on time/advances: prehistory to the middle ages, the renaissance and the age of enlightenment, ne numbers, new theories, and modern mathematics. A section on \u201cgreat mathematicians\u201d is also included.An added bonus is a 12-page removable timeline that features key moments in culture, world events, science and invention, and mathematics dating from 4000 B.C. to today. On the other side of the timeline: all sorts of mathematical enigmas (games, paradoxes, primes, problems, etc.) and a chart of mathematical symbols.\u201cMathematics: An Illustrated History of Numbers\u201d isn\u2019t the type of book you read cover to cover \u2014 unless you\u2019re a true math geek, of course \u2014 rather, it\u2019s best paged through, stopping at your areas of personal interest. Though some of the topics may at first appear over your head, the authors have made them accessible. The writing is well done and there\u2019s not too much jargon to wade through.Bottom line: Not only is this book interesting, it\u2019s fun, too."

I was able to read it for the third time this year. The third time through I was struck with the same wonder and awe I was the first two times. Through his writings, Wilson has a way to push the gospel into corners of my soul I didn't know existed. He speaks to fears no one else is and address worries that I'm too ashamed to admit I have. Though the author is a friend now, even before this was true, reading this work felt like reading the advice of a friend whose known my deepest insecurities for years. More importantly, it's like talking to a friend who not only knows my problems but knows the deepest solutions to all my problems are found in Christ.

            "This is a collection of short stories from an American writer who is not widely known these days. He is also credited with having influenced some horror writers including H.P. Lovecraft. This collection mentions horror in its title, this is misleading as only first four stories can be qualified for this genre. Some blurbs mention the stores have common theme of fictional book The King in Yellow present in them (think about it as a small and much less harmful version of Lovecraft's Necronomicon), this is misleading as well: that book makes its appearance only in the first four stories. It actually has a very brief cameo in the second story when the main character, being depressed grabbed a random book from a bookshelf and realizing it was The King in Yellow threw it away in disgust. So let me try to make a quick summary of the stories. As I mentioned above the first four (The Repairer of Reputations, The Mask, In the Court of the Dragon, and The Yellow Sign) belong to horror genre with the moral that reading the second act of The King in Yellow is a Really Bad Idea. I mentioned the influence on horror genre, the one of the fourth story in particular can be seen in later works by other writers. I think the best description of the next story (The Demoiselle d'Ys) would be fantasy romance. The next one (The Street of the Four Winds) defies the qualifications. A story of a cat with gloomy ending would be the best I can come up with. The next (The Street of the First Shell) is about horrors of war which takes place in war-torn Paris. The last two (The Street of Our Lady of the Fields, and Rue Barr\u00e9e) are romances about love between a young American man and a French woman of lower social standing. The couples are different, but some characters appear in both stories. I would like to mention a romantic scene of the last story when a drunken guy climbs into an apartment of unsuspecting lone woman in the evening. It is romantic, is not it? The best horror story I mentioned - The Yellow Sign - deserves 4.5 stars for its lasting influence if nothing else. The rest of the stories while never boring are really nothing to write home about. Considering the price of the book (it is free from Project Gutenberg) I feel I got my money worth. I can name a lot of much worse ways to spend a couple of evenings than to read this book. Three stars is the rating, nothing more, nothing less. ",
            "The first four stories were flowing pieces of cosmic horror adrift in a futuristic 1920s. If not for the latter half of the book becoming more of a drama, I would have given this five stars. I might write a short review for each of the stories I enjoyed the most. But time exists, unfortunately.",
            "Outside of Poe and Lovecraft, The Yellow Sign may be the most influential horror story ever written. It is the bridge between Gothic, Decadent, and Modern in horror. Unfortunately Chambers killed a lot of other trees. One of the most popular authors of his time, he is almost forgotten except for the slim little volume known as The King In Yellow. He wrote mainly unreadable sappy romances and unadventurous adventures. Lovecraft agonized over Chamber's wastage of his talent.The Yellow Sign is probably THE one story I never get tired of re-reading. The rest of the stories in this book are good but not masterpieces."

            "Dangerous ReadingAlternating between fin de si\u00e8cle New York and Paris, many (but not the majority) of these stories allude to another manuscript which is not present, the eponymous The King in Yellow. The experience is one of reading the second half of Cervantes\u2019s Don Quixote but knowing the first half only through the second. The King in Yellow is a play, fragments of which are strewn throughout the stories. It is referred to as a the \u201cthe supreme work of art.\u201d However, it has been banned in several countries, whether because of obscenity or subversiveness is unclear. What is clear is that those who read it are frequently driven mad and die. Even mere proximity to a copy of the book generates disturbing dreams and illusions.If there were some sort of resolution of the situation, for example a denouement of the threads in some intellectual or social conclusion about the adverse power of literature, the stories might be satisfying. As they stand, though, they are vapid individually and incoherent collectively. Chambers\u2018s talent in describing an alternative Gilded Age world, in which New York City is transformed into a provincial capital of the late Holy Roman Empire and Paris into a finishing school for young American artists, is impressive. So is his ear for accents. And his skill in symbolic manipulation is considerable. But none of this talent seems to serve a purpose. There is no development, just fragments thrown down like bread crumbs that lead nowhere.",
            "Re-read 10/23/20: I'm not going to write a normal review for these stories, even as a re-read. Instead, I'll just mention how they've already put themselves in our lives.Ideas have a life of their own. Little hints and vague mutterings can grow into huge monstrosities. From Ambrose Bierce, the author of The Unabridged Devil's Dictionary, Carcosa is breathed to life, with idyllic scenes twisted into horrific nightmares, but Robert W. Chambers, enamored with Bierce, runs with Carcosa and the King in Yellow, writing story after story with the thread of cosmic terror, artworks that, upon reading, turns people into madmen. The stories are interconnected and unique, uncanny, and merely brush the deeper sense of the madness that lies beneath the upper-crust and/or the bohemian/artistic lifestyles. They're all a piece of their time, too, and I get the impression that the horror is quite universal and would express itself in an infinite number of guises.And indeed, just as Chambers ran with Bierce's idea, Lovecraft himself ran with Chambers.The idea burrows inside our heads, too. Carcosa and the tattered King in Yellow are still alive and reaching for us from between the cracks in reality.And after Lovecraft, us.We are living the logical progression of these widening gyres of madness. Just pick up the paper. Check Twitter. It's all there. The song. From humble, or perhaps ancient beginnings, they're playing to us...Strange is the night where black stars rise,And strange moons circle through the skiesBut stranger still isLost Carcosa.Songs that the Hyades shall sing,Where flap the tatters of the King,Must die unheard inDim Carcosa.Song of my soul, my voice is dead,Die thou, unsung, as tears unshedShall dry and die inLost Carcosa.Original review:I never realized until recently that Lovecraft admired and tried to emulate a few of this author's horror feel, that his stories are the godfather of the Cthulhu mythos. Strangely enough, the prose is fluid and compelling in a way that Lovecraft couldn't match. Of course, it isn't Lovecraftian prose, but the weight of the mythos that draws so many fans, but it was a pure delight to see a spark that lit the fire for generations of horror fans around the world."

        "desc": "In this hilarious collection of personal essays, ,New York Times, bestselling author Merrill Markoe reveals, among other things, the secret formula for comedy: Start out with a difficult mother, develop some classic teenage insecurities, add a few relationships with narcissistic men, toss in an unruly pack of selfish dogs, finish it off with the kind of crystalline perspective that only comes from years of navigating a roiling sea of unpleasant and unappeasable people, and--voila --you're funny!,But in ,Cool, Calm & Contentious,, Markoe also reveals something more: herself. This is by far her most personal, affecting collection yet--honest, unapologetic, often painful, but always shot through with the bracing, wicked sense of humor that has made her such a beloved and incisive observer of life, both human and canine. In ,Cool, Calm & Contentious,, she goes there: from the anal-retentive father who once spent ten minutes lecturing Markoe's forty-year-old, Ph.D.-wielding brother on how to fold a napkin, to the eternally aggrieved mother who took pleasure in being unpleasant to waiters and spent most of her life, Markoe says, in \"varying degrees of pissed off\"; from the way she surrendered her virginity as a freshman in college (to her, it was \"something to be gotten rid of quickly, then never discussed again, like body odor\"), to why, later in life, she ultimately came to find dogs so much more appealing than humans, Markoe holds nothing back. It's all here, in all its messy, poignant glory, and told the way only Merril Markoe knows how--with honesty, wit, and bite. ,Cool, Calm & Contentious, offers something for everyone--fans of humorous essays, fans of memoir, fans of great writing and finely drawn characters, fans of dogs, fans of talking dogs, and fans of reading about mothers who are so difficult and demanding they actually make you feel good about your own life. But most of all, this book is for the many fans of Merrill Markoe, who will finally get a chance to learn what makes her tick--and what makes her so funny and wise.",

            "The best analysis of what happens to people who grow up with crazy mothers I have ever read. It turns out the desire to rearrange grim facts into jokes develops in direct proportion to the humorlessness of the environment in which one is raised!You'll get unconditional love when you do something to deserve it",
            "Some years ago I read Merrill Markoe's book What the Dogs Have Taught Me. I remember it as being side-splittingly funny, so I was happy to see that she had a new one out. (turns out she's written a number of them, I guess Merrill and I haven't kept up.) Merrill Markoe is a bitter woman. Let's just get this out there now. Each chapter is a story of its own, and I don't know if all of them were written for the book or for other things and compiled into the book. Whatever it is, it's a bit front-loaded on the bitter which makes you not want to spend much time (i.e. the rest of the book) with her. She's bitter at her (deceased) mother. She rants about how horrible mothers like hers have spawned a generation of bitter comedians. She's bitter at David Letterman, who she dated TWENTY FIVE YEARS AGO and still can't drop this subject. She's bitter at her teenage self and shares diary entries to show us what a silly person she was. After awhile it's just uncomfortable. Yes, there are a few funny moments, but mostly this is one that will be going to the used book store. ",
            "This book is a solid three and a half stars, an intelligently written book of essays I enjoyed. Having grown up with a critical parent, I can relate to the opening chapters about her mother. Having grown up with someone who had what I thought (for years!) to be 'abundant confidence', I enjoyed the chapter focusing on Narcissists. I had to laugh though, when it took me until three quarters through the 'Bobby'chapter to realize she was talking about her relationship with David Letterman (and the intern/blackmail scandal) The moment two-and-two clicked I said (aloud) 'Oooooh!' (as in 'I get it!') so loudly that I scared the cat. Can you imagine seeing old photos of you and your 80's boyfriend in the tabloids, while in line at the grocery store? Day-am! There is also an interesting chapter about celebrities and the new 'cheap fame', the sickening wave of non-talented people famous for NOTHING! (something that drives me nuts) wherein Merrill pinpoints it's roots, and I believe she's pretty accurate.The book also reiterated something I've always known: I am a cat person. As much as I am tempted to adopt a pit bull after watching 'Pitbulls and Paroles', Merrill Markoe convinced me that a dog would drive me crazy with need, and that I prefer my pets to be aloof, discerning and independent. I completely understand her love for the dogs, but realize it would throw my rhythm off. (However, that slobbering, adoring love- and the desire to please is enviable, particularly now, as my cat is curled up like a cinnamon bun on my keyboard, and could care less that I have to keep lifting her tail to get to the a.s, and d!)Merrill Markoe is a wise-ass, and she's smart and cynical. These are my people. Some people would describe her as 'quiet and mean' (thanks, Nurse Jackie!) but to me it says: I read, I think, and I don't fall for a lot of bullshit. I had my bff put this book on hold- knowing that she'll enjoy it- but as for anyone else: if you're looking for 'haha's' about shoes and dieting, this book isn't for you. Try some Jen Lancaster. I'm now going to go Merrill's blog, so I can bookmark it. She's someone with an opinion I value.",
            "This book of essays has an addictive quality to it, I couldn't put it down until it was finished. Though I've never dated David Letterman (here, Bobby), attended any fetish conventions, or had any interfaces whatsoever with the Hollywood entertainment industry, I have become a writer and fan of black humor and dogs in response to my childhood and understanding of men and politics. So yes, I'm channeling Merrill Markoe.This being MM, I knew there would be plenty of wacky female misadventures, funny pontifications on romance, dog stories, and career foibles. Check-check-check-check. There are also a lot of very personal writings about her parents, especially her larger-than-life, hypercritical mother, which will be very funny, sad, or shocking to readers, depending on their experiences of these kinds of persons (I know them well, so found Markoe's accounts both funny and sad). The almost matter-of-fact description of her sexual experiences as a young woman are what shocked me. As an Irish American, I'm afraid this is the kind of thing we usually keep the lid on. Still, I admire her for writing about her awful early sex life because it provides a case study of a young woman's coming of age in a culture that exploits her while telling her it's better to be nice--or cool--than stand up for herself.But really, the best thing about this book for me was the piece about Markoe's white water rafting trip in Utah. Laugh-out-loud funny--several times. If not for the talking stick and portapotty, I might consider going there as well.She's a very gifted comic writer. Even if some of these subjects aren't of the keenest interest to all readers, it should be hard to resist the allure of her fluent writing and comic insights. And if you love dogs, like me, she can do no wrong. Even her habit of giving her dogs the gift of speech is fine with me, given her profound understanding of the canine outlook.",
            "Here's what happens with my book selections. I find a book I think I will like on Goodreads. If it's not available at the library I put myself on the hold list. At some point in the future I get a notice from the library saying that my book is available. By the time I get to the library, I don't even know what the book is going to be. It's feels like my birthday and I've surprised myself with a book gift! With this book, I completely forgot what kind of book it was but I knew that my old self did a lot of research and carefully selected it for me. From the cover, I thought it might be a famous chef's memoir because there were flames on the words. Although I was surprised that there was no mention of food in the book, I was happy with the read. Most of the essays were funny, interesting or both. Some essays were more interesting than others. When I got to the 2nd or 3rd dog story I finally remembered reading a review of this book that complained about there being too many stories about dogs. On that point I'll have to agree. It's clear that the author is a dog lover but for me, her dog stories just convinced me more than ever to never get a dog. Most interesting to me were her essays about her mother and teen years. If you enjoy reading well written, random essays like I do, then this book will not disappoint."

Very much the standard Russian St. Petersburg is the best ever even though everyone there is miserable forever. Also what is it with Russian authors and talking about ladies' little white feet?Rundown of storiesKapitel aus einem historischen Roman - essentially just a disjointed chapter of a destroyed project.

That person tells him a horror story about a tree where some maybe Sinti and Roma? hard to tell? killed a preacher and now the tree is haunted.Das Portr\u00e4t - straight-up horror story about a portrait of a creepy moneylender that ruins the life of everyone who touches it. Main character is an artist who buys it, it makes him rich, and then he starts doing society portraits and loses all his talent and integrity. Probably my favorite in this book.Das Leben - super abstract story about various famous areas of the world like Greece, Rome etc. looking at the poor people on the Russian plains.Der Newskijprospect - someday I have to see this street everyone keeps talking about it. Tons and tons of general description, and then after about ten pages a story about two dudes who decide to creepily stalk two strange ladies home. The sensitive guy follows the beautiful brunette. It turns out she is a prostitute. He runs away and dreams of her every night and gets an opium habit so he can dream about her more, then he offers to marry her and she turns him down because she likes prostitution so he kills himself. The other guy stalks a blond lady home, turns out she's married and kind of dumb so he keeps following her around and acting to her husband like it's nbd. He tries to force himself on her and her husband and his friends beat him up and he acts like he's the wronged party. NOT MY FAVE STORY IN TERMS OF GENDER ROLES AND STUFF.Der blutige Banduraspieler - weird historical segment. Not really sure where this was going. Bandits steal a monastery's basement to torture some guy they kidnapped, but it turns out it's his wife. She immediately breaks under torture, but someone calls to her to not talk, so she doesn't. Turns out it's a skinless bandura player. Aufzeichnungen eines Wahnsinnigen - ah yes, mental illness in the 19th century. The russian bureaucracy machine drives another minor player insane as he falls in love with his boss's daughter and also thinks he hears dogs talking and he is the king of spain. He ends up being tortured in an institution. It's real fun, both in terms of totally unrealistic representation of actual delusional states and in terms of how terrible people were about dealing with mental illness.",

The three stories that appear here \u2013 The Portrait, Nevsky Prospect, The Diary of a Madman \u2013 are examples of Gogol's genius. I didn't read them on this occasion, as I have better translations in other texts. I meant purposely to read only the articles connecting the short works. I wanted to find out what was so harshly criticized and unpublishable about them. Though I'm glad to have read them, now I understand what caused this general disfavor for Gogol's journalistic endeavors.The hardest pill to gulp down here is the hyperbole. Nonfiction can't support long discourses on the color of the sky to a peasant in the middle ages, and neither can I. There's too much authorial indulgence. Gogol teaches his readers as if they were children. Pedantic raving \u2013 about art, history, geography \u2013 seem to be plucked from his hat, as if to prove his omniscient teaching ability.He's no teacher, though as the text winds up he finally begins to gain more ground in facts and valid references. I slightly enjoyed the last two articles. He seemed to let go of superfluous imagery and lambast, actually lecturing for a bit. All in all, aside from the stories which were rewritten later for his collections, this book is hardly worth the trouble, especially this poor translation and error-ridden edition."

            "Gwyneth Fairchild has been sent by her father, Isaac, to stay with his old friends from America, Winter and Bennet Lane. Never mind that it\u2019s 1814 and England is at war with America, and never mind that she doesn\u2019t want to go. As she is leaving, she is intercepted with a marriage proposal from the handsome Sir Arthur, but when she goes back inside to speak to her father, she unwittingly witnesses his murder at the hands of her Uncle Gates, so she knows she must leave, immediately, before her uncle realises what she has seen.She suffers from dreadful seasickness on the voyage, and doesn\u2019t improve even after arriving at the Baltimore home of Thaddeus Lane, son of Winter and Bennet. But they are determined to care for her, even without knowing why she is so afraid. When they find out, they are even more determined to protect her, especially Thad, who finds himself falling for the beautiful artist. I didn\u2019t enjoy Whispers from the Shadows as much as Ring of Secrets or Fairchild\u2019s Lady (a novella), because the focus was more on the relationship and the suspense around Gates and Sir Arthur, rather than on the activities of the Culper Ring, which were much more a focus of Ring of Secrets. This could be because it was rather slow to get going. Gwyneth sees her father murdered, falls to pieces mentally, and doesn\u2019t really recover until almost the halfway point. Yet Thad falls for her almost immediately, despite the fact that she\u2019s just not herself.And Thad is hiding his own secrets. He\u2019s been married before, but no one talks about it, which seems very strange. We realise why when there is a huge argument at the halfway point, and it\u2019s at this point that Whispers in the Shadows really starts to get going and pile on the suspense. Danger is coming, both from the inevitable war with the British, and from Uncle Gates. The second half of the novel is excellent, as is the unexpected finish, and I was impressed by the historical research and the way the historical events make the war between the North and the South inevitable. Although this is part of a series, it can easily be read as a stand-alone novel\u2014the parts of the story that are confusing in the first half are confusing even to someone who has read the previous books, and the questions are answered in the second half. I will look forward to the next in the series, but I hope it returns to more of a focus on the Culpers, and maintains the pace all the way through. Thanks to Harvest House and NetGalley for providing a free ebook for review. ",
            "This Second in the Culper Ring Series is as wonderfully inspiring and intriguing as the first!General Fairchild has uncovered a fatal secret. He sends his daughter Gwyneth from their home in England to friends in America in the nick of time, but not before she sees one of her mother's brothers kill her father. The ship's rocking and her horror over what she's seen send her into a frightful state. The servants who accompany her to America and her father's friends fear for her sanity.Why did her father so trust Thaddeus Lane, a young man he hadn't seen in many years, especially during this horrid war? She didn't know, but now she finds Thad is also the only one she trusts. She cannot sleep unless he is in the house, nor did she sleep on the ship on her way to this land at war with her country.Thad finds himself drawn to the haunted wraith thrust so suddenly into his and his parents' care. The young woman is a talented artist, but what are the shadows in her drawings? Why does she act so frightened? She's hiding secrets, but she's letting no one in on them--not even him, not even though it's so obvious she trusts him with her life."

            "First read: 10/14/2013Rating: 5 starsSecond read: 6/14/2020Rating: 5 starsThis was a fantastic story with a heroine who struggled with insomnia (like me!). I don\u2019t see many stories that actually feature insomnia as a large challenge for one of the leads, so it was refreshing to see it used so beautifully here.As with all the Roseanna M. White books I\u2019ve read, this one contained emotion (that early death just about did me in!), an overall tense tone (which I loved), and a mysterious air throughout (which, again, I loved). This lovely book had a wonderful plot and great twists, but it was the characters and their trials and struggles that I really connected with.Gwyneth and Thaddeus were so relatable and charming and human. Their journeys were ones worth riding along for, and I\u2019m so glad Mrs. White shared them with us. I especially enjoyed the fact that Gwyneth was basically on her own in the world yet found reliable, trustworthy people upon whom she could depend when life brought even more troubles her way.One moment that hit me hard in a very positive way was when one character wasn\u2019t able to help another. As much as this person wanted to help, that was completely impossible, and that spiritual tugging toward the truth of God\u2019s capability is something not often highlighted because it\u2019s radical. It\u2019s a radical faith these characters lived out on the pages, and it\u2019s a radical faith I want to walk every day of my life. Faith is an action, folks, and this book displayed that beautifully.",
            "Another excellent Culper Ring story! I love this series...and Roseanna White is definitely a favorite author. This story focuses on the children of the characters in the first book and novella. My only complaint is that I'd have liked another chapter! I really wanted to hear a few more details, such as hearing about Polly's baby.",

            "Whispers from the Shadows by Roseanna M. WhiteTimeframe: War of 1812Location: Baltimore, MD (a bit in London)Main Characters:Gwyneth Fairchild: Daughter of Isaac Fairchild from Fairchild's LadyThad Lane: Captain of The MasqueradeUncle Gates: Gwyneth's uncle who killed her fathersxxx Sir Arthur: Asked Gwyneth's to marry him in LondonWow! What a complicated book. Murder, a form of PTSD, an unusual draw to one person for mental peace, slave trade, marriage to a wife when husband was thought dead, cold-hearted evil, secret notes in false bottoms, surprise relatives, espionage, broken people, chasing for love and ill intent, impressed servitude, trust issues, love, romance, keys to cryptic letters, past and present art to solve mysteries, truth and secrets. Did I mention romance? I read the Culper Ring series totally out of sequence. Even though what I read was chronologically out of order, the characters in each were from different historical eras, so they were complete books in themselves. One thing I noticed in this series was a common theme of an evil person pursuing a woman, at least in two of the books and the novella. But they were well done. Synopsis:Gwyneth Fairchild witnesses a murder and given a warning to run. She's already packed to go to America so she just leaves immediately. Nearing America her ship is overtaken by an American privateer ship. She shows the captain the note her father gave her in the event this very thing happens. In it the captain is asked to deliver her to Thaddeus Lane, the most famous American captain, and trusted by her father.Her life is forever altered by these events. As hard as it is for her to hold onto her sanity, suffering from nightmares and lack of sleep, she finds solace in the family to which her father entrusted her. Thad has some sort of calming effect on her, and her draw to him is mysterious as well as one God seems to use. Secrets abound and little by little are revealed. Meanwhile, her uncle from London, and the man who considers himself her betrothed, are on their way to America in search of her, both for very different reasons. Her life is in danger and Thad has made it his mission to protect her at any cost.Very complex book. But it works. Maybe not my favorite Roseanna M. White book, but still worth a read.",
            "Fantastic story! I thoroughly enjoyed this exciting and romantic mystery. Couldn\u2019t put it down. Can\u2019t wait for book 3 which is my next read!",
            "This book was my favorite book of 2013.I don't say that lightly. I really, really loved this story. Gwyneth definitely fits the bill for a damsel in distress, and Thaddeus Lane (isn't that an awesome name?) is a one-of-a-kind hero. But more than that, the strong theme of whispers, secrets, and enduring love tied this book to the top of my favorites list.Gwyneth witnesses her father's murder and flees for her life. Insomnia wracks her on the voyage from England to America until she is extremely unwell, but then in Thad's presence, she realizes she is safe, that he can be trusted. That was the sweetest scene. I just loved how Thad put her immediately at ease.The danger is not over, however. Far from it. I hesitate to say too much, I'd much rather you buy this book and experience the adventure for yourself! The pacing was just right, I could hardly put it down. The moments of realization in the middle of the book made my jaw drop and jazz hands happen. And the ending. Well. I'll leave that for you to discover, but, rest assured, it is the most beautiful, sigh-worthy romance I've read in a long time. Thad's decision was the heroic ultimate. Gwyneth's growth was awesome to behold. And she's an artist! The way that is worked into the plot and how things fall into place was genius!These characters became friends, and I was sorry to see their story end. Thankfully, it doesn't--there's more in the series! Yay!Why I Recommend This BookReaders of historical fiction will thoroughly enjoy Roseanna M. White's latest release--may it glue to your hands as it did mine and become a bookshelf favorite! Whispers from the Shadows is sure to wrap its way around your heart!Watch for the inspirational message, too. I want to be more like Gwyneth--who learned that the Lord is trustworthy and true.",
            "Whispers from the Shadows was such a wonderful book! Roseanna White is truly such a gifted writer! I found myself getting lost in the words, felt myself right there with the characters, experiencing their joys and sorrows, their ups and downs. I truly felt as if I were visiting early 1800's America. There were a couple of really surprising reveals that I did not see coming, I loved being shocked like I was. Definitely one of the best books I've read this year, I can't recommend Whispers from the Shadows enough!"

            " Milan has moved to town to escape a bad relationship mistake. She doesn't like leaving her family, but soon makes some amazing friends. One of those friends sets up an interview for Milan at her son's realty company. But Adrian is tired of his mom's incessant matchmaking and mistakes Milan for another match. It will take him tons of apologies to correct his mistake.The book was funny at times. It also seemed a little cliche. The outcome was completely predictable, as are most romance novels. But the emotions and reactions were also predictable. The standard conflict that seems standard issue in a romance was also there, but it felt thrown in at the last minute to create some drama. I just didn't buy the resolution.The female character in the book speaks Spanish. Since I don't, it was extremely difficult to follow the story. The author would translate some of it, but it really broke up the flow of the story. I guess I like my men and women in a romance to have a lot less fighting and more of a connection than just physical.I received this book free of charge from Goodreads in exchange for my honest review.",

But this is a problem for Adrian Anderson and his mother, he been bit once isn't looking and mother is not happy.I wish I could have enjoyed the story more however the language difference was a problem for me was not sure what was being said due to my like of the Spanish language. I read the authors interview where she states the language was written so as not to be a problem We have to agree to dis agree on that issue. I hope in her next book she uses a break down of the words that are not use in the English language.",

            "So, I don't write reviews often because I tend to be either mean or totally smarmy, but I really needed to let it go. I'm a fan of books with the matchmaking theme and as a native Spanish speaker the idea of a book that has Spanish in it was very intriguing. So in the begining the Spanish was good and the use of punctuation was making me smile but as the story went on I realized I was wrong and then I was all frowny. At times the author was barely able to express the basic idea she was trying to convey and even knowing Spanish it was really hard to understand what she was trying to say, so I can't imagine how was the reading of this book for people who doesn't understand Spanish well. Maybe for some people the easy part was that the author wrote plenty of the Spanish in this book very literally. Some expressions you use on your daily life she just translated them literally (Google maybe?) and although some were understandable some didn't make much sense, so it was confusing and frankly annoying, specially when the characters kept repeating how fluent they were and I just couldn't stopped rolling my eyes the whole time thinking Ah, no you're not.I specially remember Mil\u00e1n saying \u201cEst\u00e1s lleno de ti mismo\u201d which is the literal translation for you're full of yourself but in Spanish that phrase doesn't exist. I understand the meaning in English and there's a lot of other words that could have expressed what she was trying to say and the fact that she didn't use them was disappointing for the building of the character.Also when they kept talking to each other in the polite form when they're supposed to be sisters or lovers talking to each other was disconcerting. When they kept refering to the other in the wrong personal pronoun was also very annoying. I'm not perfect and I'm far from been great in English but I believe in doing things as correctly as possible specially in your work and if she was in doubt with some expressions maybe she could have asked someone about them. Plus the publishing houses have editors that are supposed to check in facts and grammar and I think her editor didn't accomplish a very good job with this book.My intention is not bashing on the author or her knowledge in Spanish. I think it's awesome she knows Spanish in any measure she does and that she was trying to include our language in a book, but sadly the language thing didn't let me fully enjoy the book.I would never tell someone not to read a book because I think you have to read them to make your own opinions of them and to judge them rightly so if this book caught your interest for any reason I think you should give it a chance. I still think the story was different, the author used characters I haven't read in other stories before since many romance novels have the same type of Heroes and heroines and medling mothers, but I specially liked the female characters. ",
            "Love in BloomI really loved this book. Nothing like a strong woman to bring a pig headed man down a peg or two. Milan always had a way of putting Adrian in his face. I would have given it five stars, but I didn't care that so much was in Spanish. There were full sentences that I didn't feel were translated enough for me to know what was being said.",
            "Love the book, the storyline but if I didn't feel like I was in Spanish class all over again, I'd given it 5 stars. Thankfully, living in Southern California has helped me read this quicker than expected. ^_^ lol "

            "Perhaps not as good as #1 in the Dressmakers series, but this book is filled with classic Loretta Chase humor, fun characters, and a bit of adventure. Yes, Harry is a bit of a dim bulb (but he's really quite clever in his own way), and Sophie is a bit of a bossy Bess, but it's lots of fun to watch these two tangle. And please tell me that somehow, some way, poor Lady Clara will wind up with her own HEA.Favorite quotes:\u201cThat\u2019s what brings in the customers: the combination of gossip and the intricate detail about the dresses, all related as drama.

            "...One needs to be able to dress without help, if necessary.You must be deuced flexible, he said.Wrong thing to say.She went quiet and his mind starting painting pictures. Just in case he wasn't heated enough already.For Sophy Noirot and her two sisters, their dressmaking establishment Maison Noirot, is not just a business but a passion. Three years ago they arrived from Paris with little more than their dressmaking talents. Now having secured Lady Clara, the Earl of Longmore's sister as their foremost client, they are determined to keep her in the height of fashion. This of course is only possible if she marries well. When Clara is caught in a tryst with the impoverished Lord Adderly, a hasty engagement ensues. Unable to break the betrothal without a scandal, she runs off. Without Clara, business for Maison Noirot will suffer. Determined to bring Clara, their friend and client back home, Sophy sets out with Clara's brother, Harry, Lord Longmore. Like her sister Marcelline, heroine of the first book in this series, Sophy is independent and resourceful. Throw in a fair amount of cunning and guile that she deploys in not only their business but in tracking down her runaway client, and you have a delightful and unconventional heroine. For all of Sophy's initial impressions of Harry as a dim-witted oaf, he displays an admirable common sense, responsibility and loyalty to his sister and friends. The interactions between these two are a delight. The only quibble I have about this story is the same as I had about the hero, Clevedon in the first book. Longmore doesn't actually do anything. I suppose this idleness may be an accurate depiction of an earl's life in 1835. But it also makes him just that bit less attractive and admirable as a hero. But nonetheless his character is written with real likability.Scandal Wears Satin is written in Loretta Chase's signature glorious prose, and this is a wonderful second book in The Dressmakers series.

            "An easy 4.5 stars. What a fun book! The banter between Longmore (hero) and Sophie (heroine) was hilarious. This was the classic tale of the whip-smart girl and the gorgeous hunk who seems incredibly thick but is actually not that thick at all. Yes, there was a ton of clothes-talk, but I loved the whole concept of Maison Noirot and the dressmakers. (I am not particularly into fashion per se, but I actually enjoyed the detailed research and wonderful descriptions. Don't let that part put you off.)Both MCs were charming in their own way, and I liked how Sophie resisted their attraction because she thought Longmore just another ,b&gt,idiot aristocrat. He ended up having such a great sense of responsibility and his regard for her was total. Sigh!Sophie, fiercely independent and very intelligent, is forced to accept Longmore's help when the most important client of their dressmaking shop, who happens to be his sister, does a runner to avoid marriage.Their travels together are very amusing. She usually feels the urgent need to thump Longmore, if not to kill him, and he gradually realises he has fallen in love with her, even though he is not one for deep introspection or, he believed, deep feelings. He doesn't fight it. Hooray! Finally, a hero who doesn't overthink every bloody thing. (I get a bit tired of authors trying to make heroes overly-complicated. IMHO, most blokes are pretty simple, and they are not going to analyse everything all the time. Or run away from their feelings. Angst for the sake of it is just annoying). As I said, he is a man who goes on instinct. He realises he loves her and he will let NOTHING stand in the way of his getting her. And marrying her. And he will work on her until she says yes. Longmore is such a cutie- all masculine gorgeousness and instincts (There's a fight? Yes, please- let me at him, says Longmore- I need to let off some steam!) Yet with a really noble heart. And, weirdly enough, a remarkable gift for languages! Yes, he started out quite sexist and domineering. The rigid role division of the time, the sexist and class-based assumptions everyone made, were only going to feed those prejudices. But he learnt very quickly that Sophie was not the usual sort and he changed his tune, thank God. Just as well- he did piss me off a bit at the start :) The difficulties of being a romantic feminist. Probably an oxymoron.Sophie is all biting wit, articulate prose and hidden vulnerability. It takes her a while to acknowledge that sometimes it is nice to share a burden, or to let someone rescue her. They are perfect for each other. After encountering so many non-romantic HR's lately, where there is just sex or history, but no real emotional or spiritual elements, it was so good to feel the ROMANCE.As always, Kate Reading' narration was excellent. Scandal Wears Satin only improved on the re-read/listen: highly recommended.I kind of think this is a bit like Longmore trying to thinkAnd a gratuitous pic of my fave tall dark hunk....",
            "Right in front of their noses...It's amazing how you can see what you want to see instead of what is in front of your face. I'm very guilty of this when I'm proofreading my own work. Sometimes I'm shocked at re-reading what I've previously written and find words that don't even make sense or seem remotely correct. It's like my brain thinks a word and my hands type something somewhat close...sounding/meaning. I guess we're all guilty of seeing what we expect...like maybe a French heiress instead of a dressmaker.I really liked this story...well mostly. I find myself continuously squinty-eyed when the hero is an obnoxious buffoon who casts a lady he meets into the slot of mistress instead of the wife. Well, this guy is not the smartest tool on the shelf by his own admission. It still frustrated me that he took nearly the whole book to see this incredibly smart and interesting woman as more than what was between her legs. Luckily, in good historical romance fashion, he comes good and I loved him by the end.This series has been thoroughly entertaining. Each of the sisters is an original and I loved that they use their intelligence as well as their looks to succeed.Again, the narrator does a fantastic job. Like the first book I listened to in the series, the only character I find annoying (listening to) is Clara. It's a touch little girly whiney (shudders).I will definitely be going on in the series. ",
            "Second in the series about the charming and slightly conniving dressmakers that want to sweep the Ton but end up catching noblemen instead. The series is on the cusp between the Regency and early Victorian which is captured by the fashions of the time.Chase has done her research as she writes of fashion terms that I have had to Google. Not my favorite fashion era. Too much sleeve.Still a three star, but the banter and the chemistry are much better between the H and h. She\u2019s another little schemer, but a schemer only when it comes to furthering the sisters\u2019 business and rescuing the H\u2019s little sister from a scandal. She\u2019s attracted to the big lummox of a hero but doesn\u2019t know what to do with him.The hero reflecting on the heroine...evil dressmaker by day and Tom Foxe\u2019s premier spy by night.Not a game changer but a nice way to spend some time reading.",
            "I do not know how to give him the five stars, the truth. My doubt lies in the end, a little precipitated. To see I liked it a lot, both she and he are tremendous. Menudos dialogues!. I have seen a very important evolution by Harry (Longmore). I liked how through Sophy, he has changed his way of seeing women. To see them how to get something to protect, helpless, or worse, how grouper for the needs of it. Sophy, with its independence, its strength of character, its ease, has given him zascas constantly. It has made me a lot of grace how something said or thought, Sophy arrived and towards him all. For course, Sophy eats the book and Everything that takes place ahead. It was like seeing Matajari and great theater actress. Because one thing is clear, this woman was transformed and embellished all that looked at her. What capacity to manipulate and turn the tortilla. The power of the Word, both written and spoken, is very powerful and she does it masterfully. I think Loretta Chase creates very strong, very claiming female characters and, perhaps, different from the time they lived. I'm not going to go on that if she is real or not a character like that. For me the merit is that she is credible within unlikelitude. And that, has a tremendous achievement. On the other hand, I have the feeling that the books are like small strokes for the final book of Clara. It is possible that it is my perception, or my desire to reach that book. But the frames, both the previous one and it is, Ronda about it. Of course, Clara is enjoying me. And to finish, they still seem like the sisters some women champo, to take off his hat. And now I'm going for the third, in English (shit).",
            "Lovely when you manage to overcome the first 60-70 pages.My biggest complain is that the hero is described often as on idiot who cannot grasp what the heroine explain to him! The heroine is a very intelligent and has some very cunning ideas how to save the hero's sister from utter riun, while the hero just want to do what he think is better even if his ideas are stupid.The heroine has to manage both him and the situation. Still, becaus of his idiocy he is endearing as a cute unruly child is... LOL"

            "Full disclosure. I'm a diehard fan of Ms. Bradshaw (and anything involving N.C.), but this was not her best effort. It honestly pains me to say that! I was so hooked at the beginning! Great character set-up, loved the description and history of this remote place, Ocracoke Island. Miss Fanny's character...priceless. Molly the attorney...great. I just couldn't get past Gray. She was so emotionally immature, stereotypically impulsive, and indiscriminate in terms of her sexual appetites. Don't get me wrong, I'm all about butch roles-- truly-- just not hot-headed, 40 yo adolescent ones. I got the attraction part, missed the substance. By default, and because someone had to be the adult, Lizbeth fell into more of a matronly role. Total buzzkill. Didn't light me up the way I count on Ms. Bradshaw's excellent writing to do. All said though, I still am, and will always remain, a supportive fan. ",
            "Waking Up Gray, is another wonderful addition to the list of R.E. Bradshaw's books. The previous four books have been little gems, but Waking Up Gray just has that extra final polish on it that made it a joy to read. The best compliment I can give to show how much I enjoyed it, is that as soon as I finished, I immediately read it again.Lizbeth Jackson is on the final stretch of starting a new life at 40. She's spent the last five years, after divorcing a cheating husband, studying Linguistic Anthropology and will soon graduate with a Master's Degree as soon as she finishes her thesis paper. She intends to study the Carolina Brogue on Ocracoke Island, where she spent her childhood holidays. The first day there she meets Fanny, who lives across the road with her granddaughter, Gray. Lizbeth is shocked to find herself unexpectedly attracted to the flirtatious Gray and can't help but flirt back. It doesn't take long for Lizbeth to fall deeper and deeper for Gray, once she gets over being attracted to another female. Gray, despite her reputation for only having casual flings, seems to want more from their budding relationship, if only she can overcome the ghost of her past.I loved everything about this book. The characters are all enjoyable, Fanny is the wise, funny old grandmother everyone wishes they had to give them advice, Lizbeth's daughter Mazie is funny and accepting and knows her mother well, there's even an appearance from Molly Kincaid, the well-known lesbian attorney who we know from a couple of other Bradshaw books. The attraction between Gray and Lizbeth is sizzling hot, the romance builds wonderfully, with just a little miss-communication and angst to make you appreciate the romance all the more. And as always with Bradshaw's books, the landscape itself plays a role in the story. Even though I've never been anywhere near the US, I feel like I've traveled along with the characters through the Outer Banks of North Carolina. Along with her other books, Waking Up Gray definitely makes it onto my re-read list.",
            "If you love drama then you will certainly love this book. Personally, I felt it a tad much and in some cases immature especially for the ages of the couples involved. I loved Fanny's character... Her depiction makes me wish I had a Grandma or Grandaunt like her.Also I must add that the story felt unnecessarily too long... There were many early chapters that ought to have ended the story and that kind of bored me. It deserves a little more than the 3stars I gave it, more like 3.5",

Lizbeth is surprised to find out that Gray is her age and that she is attracted to her.What follows is a beautiful mellow slow burning romance, where both women come to terms with Lizbeth\u2019s past then Gray\u2019s past.Fabulous cameo role for Molly Kincaid who with Lizbeth\u2019s daughter Mazie try to help, and sometimes inadvertently hinder but the star of the book has to be Fanny :-)The island and it\u2019s people form an exquisite backdrop as Bradshaw explores the shades of sexuality, the power of attraction, the difference between love and lust and the barriers we erect to protect us from being hurt.Will Gray let Lizbeth through her barriers and can Lizbeth trust Gray to stop being a wampus cat and stay loyal to her ?"

            "Less about cemeteries than about racehorses, this is a very strange book indeed. It might serve as an introduction to the appeal of graveyards for a skeptical relative who understands the jargon of horse racing and is familiar with the big races, champions, and breeders of the past.It might also provide an itinerary for travel in Kentucky. Zeh explains that equine graveyards vary from a lone monument to formal cemeteries, some of which include bronze statuary. The book indexes horse monuments by farm, followed by maps that show where the bodies are buried. (So to speak, anyway. Sometimes horses were not buried in their entirety: only their heads, hearts, and hooves were interred.) The morbid aspects are glossed over in favor of biographies of the deceased.The book includes a color photo of each headstone visited, as well as copious photos of the horses, jockeys, and races. Some of the cemeteries are remarkably poignant.I envision tourists standing beside the granite marker of Domino, one of the gamest and more generous of horses, reading from the guidebook about his victories and funeral. For some reason, the image warms my black heart.This review originally appeared on Gothic.Net in November 2001."

            "This was a bittersweet re-read of my good friend Lucy's book, as she passed away very suddenly and tragically last month. I was honored to join her on many of these farm visits and thoroughly enjoyed this trip down memory lane. The book takes you on a tour of many of the cemeteries and memorials in the Lexington area dedicated to great Thoroughbreds of the past, from the oldest markers in the bluegrass: Longfellow (1867-1983) and Ten Broeck 1872-1887), and coming up through the memorials of 20th century racehorses at well known modern farms such as Three Chimneys and Ashford Stud. I enjoyed the fact that the book told a little bit about each location before discussing some of the horses buried there, briefly covering their racing and breeding careers. The photographs are just as interesting, seeing the variety of memorials used to grace the burial sites, from simple headstones such as Secretariat's, that includes just his name, year of birth and year of death, to large memorials such as the one at the Kentucky Horse Park that honors Man o' War. It's heartwarming to me to know that these horses that bring us so much joy are so honored in their deaths. Rereading this book was my way of honoring Lucy. You will be missed, my friend."

From the assembly lines of Henry Ford to the open roads of Route 66, from the lore of Jack Kerouac to the sex appeal of the Hot Rod, America\u2019s history is a vehicular history\u2014an idea brought brilliantly to life in this major work by Pulitzer Prize\u2013winning journalist Paul Ingrassia. Ingrassia offers a wondrous epic in fifteen automobiles, including the Corvette, the Beetle, and the Chevy Corvair, as well as the personalities and tales behind them: Robert McNamara\u2019s unlikely role in Lee Iacocca\u2019s Mustang, John Z. DeLorean\u2019s Pontiac GTO , Henry Ford\u2019s Model T, as well as Honda\u2019s Accord, the BMW 3 Series, and the Jeep, among others. Through these cars and these characters, Ingrassia shows how the car has expressed the particularly American tension between the lure of freedom and the obligations of utility. He also takes us through the rise of American manufacturing, the suburbanization of the country, the birth of the hippie and the yuppie, the emancipation of women, and many more fateful episodes and eras, including the car\u2019s unintended consequences: trial lawyers, energy crises, and urban sprawl. Narrative history of the highest caliber, Engines of Change is an entirely edifying new way to look at the American story.",

            "Interesting take on history by looking at the impact of different cars on American society. Plenty of social history included, but car buffs would really like this. Lots about the personalities behind the cars and car companies. Best of all was his take on the 2 most significant, in his mind. That's fodder for many conversations.Took a while to get used to the reader - not to my liking, but I eventually got okay with him. "

            "Not really a tech-y book about cars, but about 100+ years of American history, our culture (and pop culture), business, and sociology. This one's not just for the gear-head crowd, folks! Ingrassia's work educates - with a fair dose of humor and opinion - while it entertains and I'm fond of that type of style in a book, TV show, and/or movie. He deftly is able to connect the dots between Mustangs, Corvettes, and GTOs to Beetles, Prius, and minivans. This one may be going onto my 'favorites' list.",
            "EofC is a really good look at the Detroit Big Three back when they really were the Big Three. Ingrassia covers fifteen of what he sees as the cars that changed America. Included are Mustang, Corvette, the Corvair. It was fun and interesting to read about the luck, the mistakes, the changes over 40 years and since that's the same 40 to 50 years I've been driving I remember a lot of what he talks about. My favorite by far is the chapter on the Jeep which talks more about the changing tastes of American mainstream than anything else. I never thought of L.L. Bean and the Gremlin and Jeep brand as having something in common.If, on the other hand, you're not a car nut than this is probably not for you. But, tired of the van, then maybe it's time to look at the car culture. No new models here just good reading for us gearheads. My first car was a 1955 Bel-Air Chevy my dad bought for me to commute to school. It had a steering wheel that should have been on a riverboat, the gas cap was hidden behind the tail light, and I could probably sleep in the trunk if I had to. My first car I owned was a 1970 Pontiac LeMans. It was the last of the super cool Pontiac. I've only owned the Pontiac, a new VW, a used Tempo and a used '95 Ford Ranger. I had a pal who married the back of a '65 Vette with the front end of a '64 Vette. One evening, in the summer, we took it out on the US 45 south of Tolono, Illinois, and he lit her up! That baby could punch holes in the atmosphere. ",
            "This book (like the title suggests) is the American dream in fifteen cars. Some of the facts about those cars, the history behind their existence, and the history they represent were very surprising. I didn't know that the Corvette almost wasn't made and the war of the great tail fins happened. Nor did I know the story behind the Prius and the Beetle. This book showed me what the American Dream is all about through the lens of a subject I love, cars. It changed my view of how we the people have evolved and adapted to overcome the obstacles placed before us and it proved to me that we make great cars. Each chapter is the story and relevance for another car. There weren't really and debatable subjects except maybe which car is the best. I would recommend this book to people who care about the history of the American Dream and who care about cars. I loved this book because I care about both.",
            " This is more than a car book. It is culural history at its finest, a unique approach and informative on a grand scale. It deftly traces the evolution of the automobile industry and its influence on changes in American entertainment and life styles, and vice-versa. It will bring back memories to readers of all ages. I was not prepared for the pleasure I found in this book. ",
            "If you\u2019re a car buff, this is a rollicking read, impossible to put down! I enjoyed it from front to back, it never lost my interest, and it will change how you think of various time periods in history. American\u2019s self-image have always been connected to the cars they drove (who keeps the paperwork from their first computer purchase, or names it?), yet certain cars in American history \u201crose above merely defining the people who drove them. ..Like some movies, and books they defined large swaths of American culture, helped to shape their era, and uniquely reflected the spirit of their age.\u201d This book chronicles 15 of those cars, and Paul Ingrassia is an excellent tour guide, being the former Detroit bureau chief for the Wall Street Journal and other of other books on the auto industry. Here\u2019s how he frames it, which I just loved:\u201cModern American culture is basically a big tug-of-war. It\u2019s a yin-versus-yang contest between the practical and the pretentious, the frugal versus the flamboyant, haute cuisine versus hot wings, uptown versus downtown, big-is-better versus small-is-beautiful, and Saturday night versus Sunday morning. Every vehicle in this book represents either practicality or pretension, although a couple of them straddle the great divide.\u201dDid the cars shape the culture, or the culture shape the cars? \u201cLet\u2019s just say it\u2019s both.\u201d You\u2019ll meet not only the well-known names behind each car (Ford, Sloan, DeLorean, Iacocca, Porsche, etc.) but also the less known engineers and designers who did so much behind the scenes to bring these cars to market, sometimes fighting against the bureaucracies of the very companies in which they worked. For instance, the man behind the Corvette is a fascinating story. My favorite line in the book is actually from John Steinbeck\u2019s Cannery Row:\u201cSomeone should write an erudite essay on the moral, physical, and esthetic effect of the Model T Ford on the American nation. Two generations of Americans knew more about the Ford coil than the clitoris, about the planetary system of gears than the solar system of stars.\u201dWell, Paul Ingrassia did exactly that with this work. One of my Top Five books of the year, highly recommended.",
            "The book Engines of Change by Paul Ingrassia walks you through the history of fifteen famous cars. The book starts with introducing Henry Ford who was the founder of the Ford Motor Company. He created a revolutionary vehicle called the Model T that was the most popular automobile of its time because it was well designed to make transportation even better. The Model T was the creation of The Ford Motor Company which started their success. Although the Model T was one of the best selling cars of its time other companies were creating vehicles to compete with Ford. Later in time newer car designs were being built and the Volkswagen Beetle came to be popular after the Model T. Surprisingly enough Adolf Hitler actually owned a Volkswagen Beetle because he wanted something was economical and efficient. These two cars started the competition of which company could create a car with both fashion and quality of transportation. Then Ford introduced the Mustang that was designed for racing. The Mustang was a special combination of a casual car that had speed. Overall, Ford has been seen to have incredible inventions in the past and they are still doing a great job with creating new models to this day.This book was really fascinating to learn about these car companies and their previous creations compared to the cars of today. It was enjoyable to hear about what their first creations were like compared to their newest models because they are so different. This book was interesting because I enjoy cars and like to learn about their history. I had no idea how these cars had such an impact on people\u2019s lives. Reading about the Mustang was my favorite part of the book because people were amazed by its performance and speed. All in all, I was thoroughly educated about the automobile history and am excited to keep up on the future of what these companies are going to accomplish next.",
            "For a car lover like myself, this is book was an extremely engaging read. Much more than a look at the evolution of the automobile, this microhistory examines how culture steered the development of the car (front-wheel drive?!) and likewise how the car drove the culture (rear-wheel drive?!). You might think such subject matter would be dry, but the author (Paul Ingrassia) brings it alive by telling the personal stories of the men behind the machines and even the consumers themselves. You might not expect it from a car guy, but Ingrassia is actually a very good writer and thorough researcher, plus his sense of humor comes through in every chapter. I'm a tail fin guy myself (and owner of a 1961 Imperial), so I was delighted by the an entire chapter devoted to this memorable era and men like Virgil Exner, the designer of my Imperial, who popularized them. Whatever era of car you prefer, I believe this book will rev up your engine.",
            "An enjoyable well-researched read into the legacy of several cars that defined the automobile landscape. Ingrassia has picked models that every enthusiast knows and shares the background history of models that excelled, and some that failed. A must read for car lovers of all ages."

            "Edit 02/06/15: I got bored and reread the second half of this. I mentioned the whole rape and abortion thing in my original mini review and I'm going to mention it again. Abortion is a tricky topic. There really is no right answer to the issue. On one hand, abortion is destroying a life. On another hand, women should have a right to choose and if not for abortion, many children could grow up in unsuitable homes or be abandoned. There's a debate about abortion at their school, and the characters choose their sides. All the good characters choose the pro-life side and the bad characters argue in favour of abortion. Not cool. Winnie's (the main character) teacher, Pat tells her that they need more people to argue in favour of it, and that God will help her because Winnie is arguing against abortion, which is what's RIGHT. Not cool. Winnie reacts in disbelief when she heard that another character is arguing in favour of abortion (I can't be bothered finding a quote because I'm tired, but it goes along the lines of wow, I can't believe he/she would argue for abortion!)I felt like the author was shoving her own beliefs down my throat. I don't have a distinct opinion for or against abortion, and I don't appreciate a children's book trying to force one on me. Rape is also mentioned in the debate as something that causes unwanted pregnancy.Seriously, this book is meant for 10 year olds. It's super inappropriate to cover such topics in a children's book, and I really hated the way that the book tried to force abortion views on me. I would not recommend this for anyone below the age of 14. Or to anyone really. It's a shame, since the series is otherwise pretty good.Original review: This book was awesome. Seriously, I can't believe I just read a middle grade horse book and liked it so much. However, there are references to abortion and rape in this book, which make it inappropriate for younger readers. Honestly, I wish those could have been taken out.",
            "Winnie Willis dreams of jumping her horse, Nickers. She already practices during her morningly rides, but her Arabian isn't built for the taller jumps.

Bold Beauty, as Winnie has named this spirited animal, isn't improving at all. In fact, she's losing confidence, and her owners are wondering if she's even worth the efforts. Winnie claims she can gentle Beauty in two weeks, and she would do it the right way. The owners agree, and Beauty is taken to Winnie's place. But, after injuring herself after a terrible fall, Winnie begins to lose her own confidence. Did she make too big of a promise?This exciting sequel to Eager Star will wrap you in Winnie's spiritual journey as she discovers more about herself and the mare she has committed to. You can learn so much from these novels, and I highly encourage you to read them!",

            "Barbara Michaels may have written a big batch of books in a certain genre, but she kept most of them unique and didn't indulge in formulaic safety nets. In Vanish with the Rose she does again focus on her love of old houses, rose gardens and landscaping, but the story-line isn't an old fashioned ghost story. Lawyer Diana Reed is doing undercover sleuthing and pretending to be a rose expert while she tries to figure out where her older brother ended up. Was he dead? Missing? That's the real reason she's out there digging through the dirt of a particular family.ttttttDiana may have personal family issues, but the family dynamics of the house she visits brings a lot of charm and humor to the story. The mother is especially cute in a quirky way. Throwing in the dedicated housekeeper as a companion and fellow detective was a fun as well, including her weird situation with her ex (potential red herring alert). There are two men who may contend for the heroine's heart but as usual Michaels doesn't put much romance into the plot pot, and it could have been either/or by the end of the story with the same result. ttttttThe mystery isn't bad, it hints at paranormal and slowly solves a crime she's not sure exists. I wasn't terribly surprised at the ending but it was a good, somber one that fit the dreary mood of what they find out. While the mystery is only so-so with its strength, it does come across heavy in comparison to some of her other mysteries. A lot of those books dealt with horrors of the past, but this one makes sure they stay present, front and center.ttttttIt's not my favorite of hers, but it's a good one, made even better by her usual gorgeous writing style and knack for sarcastic dialogue as the characters bounce theories and debates off each others egos. Recommended for Michaels fans or those who like slow-paced mysteries...with rose gardens.",
            "Oh my word, this book was so tedious! I was expecting a suspenseful, creepy gothic mystery. Instead, what I got was 300+ pages of characters doing home renovation, landscaping, making food, cleaning, having long conversations with cringey dialogue, driving, and antique shopping. Oh yes, with occasional reference to a possible murder (or murders?) and one character having \u201cdeja vu\u201d visions of the past. It was like watching HGTV all day and flipping to a third-rate crime procedural one commercial break an hour.If I had realized this was the same author (writing under a different name) who wrote Crocodile on the Sandbank, which I also didn\u2019t particularly enjoy, I probably wouldn\u2019t have gone for this one.",
            "Diana Reed isn\u2019t who she says she is. She isn\u2019t an expert on antique roses (the ones that predate the now-ubiquitous, ever-blooming hybrid tea roses, introduced in 1867) or a garden landscaper. Diana Reed isn\u2019t even her real name.Diana has maneuvered to get herself hired as a rose expert by the Nicholsons, a family that literally won the lottery and used the proceeds to buy and renovate an 18th century home near the small town of Faberville. The Nicholsons bought the home from the senile Matilda Musser, and it was in the last days of Miss Musser\u2019s tenure that Diana\u2019s brother, Brad Randall, had come to stay at the house, serving as handyman and helper to the 90-something-year-old lady. Until one day, without warning, Brad was gone, never to be heard from again. Diana knows her brother would never just disappear without a word. And she\u2019s staying at the Nicholsons\u2019 in hopes of finding out what really happened. Barbara Michaels (pseudonym, along with Elizabeth Peters, for archeologist Barbara Mertz) usually pens delightful supernatural romances. Vanish with the Rose doesn\u2019t rise to the level of the Georgetown series, Be Buried in the Rain, Other Worlds, or Wait for What Will Come, Michaels spends so much time on Diana\u2019s guilt and Mrs. Nicholson\u2019s son\u2019s goofiness that it isn\u2019t until nearly halfway through the novel that we get to the crux of the matter. But once Michaels gets going, readers will have a hard time putting Vanish with the Rose down. Also, Michaels\u2019 worst novels \u2014 like this and The Copenhagen Connection \u2014 are still much better than the vast majority of other writers\u2019 best. So be sure to save this one for a rainy day when you\u2019ll have lots of interrupted reading time.",
            "If Michaels set out to write an entertaining and intriguing suspense with a soupcon of the supernatural and a lagniappe of romance, she has succeeded. Yes, parts of it are pure fantasy. Why would people who had only just met a young woman go away for two weeks on the spur of the moment and leave her in charge? The first third of the book Diana is masquerading as an old roses expert and the book is a bit coy about who she really is and why she is there, but not excruciatingly so. She also runs into young men right and left and there is enough withheld to not be absolutely sure which she will end up with until the end. But what really worried me was when Andy more or less moves into his mother's house, who is taking care of the big green dog? And what work has Diane actually been hired to do? All the garden landscaping appears to be well underway. Also, when all four young people decide, for securities sake, to hang out together in the house, it did have a bit of a summer camp feel (or Scooby-do?)",
            "Classic B-Mike. But this book totally annoyed me for failing to explain a.) Diana's narrow escape from the falling gate in the barn, and b.) whatever scam was being pulled on Miss Musser. I suppose that I am perfectly capable of inferring that Pearl and Mr. Sweet were robbing her blind of heirlooms and valuables, but that was never made clear. But, really, I have no idea what to think of what happened in the barn. Was it the ghost? How could it have been, though! At first I was sure her brother must be alive specifically because it was the only thing that made sense. So that bothered me. But otherwise it was fine, and the mystery made rather a lot more sense than they usually do. I thought it was too bad that everyone allowed Larry (as odious as he was) to take the blame for Brad's murder, even dead, that's just not fair to him or his family. "

            "First off, thanks go to Lisa for awarding me this book from her first blog giveaway. If you enjoy those gothic books (from the 1960's and 1970's especially), visit Lisa's awesome blog at:http://gothicked.blogspot.comShe's written a ton of book reviews on all types of gothic lit. There's a little something for every gothic taste.OK, now on the the review.I'm pretty sure I read this book when it was first published in the early 1990's. Michaels is one of my favorite gothic writers and many of her books are in my top 50 favorites. She's been very prolific, and her books have a more modern, sarcastic and feministic voice then Victoria Holt or Monica Heath, who were more traditional in their approach to gothic lit. That being said, Vanish with the Rose wasn't one of her better attempts, IMO. The premise was there for sure: a young female attorney travels to Virginia to find out what happened to her missing brother. She adopts a professional disguise - posing as an expert on roses- so that she can meet the family who bought the stately Colonial home where he brother was working before he vanished months before. Sounds perfect, right? And normally I'd agree. Michaels is a good writer - no doubt about that. She creates subtle paranormal atmosphere with a good dose of scepticism, witty characters you get fond of, and a neat ending calculated to satifsy....except this one didn't satisfy me.Somehow, every element that she manipulates so skillfully fell flat. The spooky elements were so lacking as to be almost non-existent. The characters were one dimensional and not very likable. It was hard to get a picture of them in my mind, and at times the male and female characters became interchangable in my mind. There was an over abundance of profanity (g-damn) which didn't add anything to the plot and is a curse word I personally despise to hear or read (I'm no prude, and I cuss more then I should, but in my lexicon that word and the c-word is out). Finally, the ending was frankly depressing, which isn't usually how Michaels rounds out her books. I guess there was a reason why this one hadn't stayed in my keeper bookshelf so long ago.But don't let anything I say sway you from trying Barbara Michaels if you're thinking of doing so. She's a fantastic writer and I still love her to bits (and only wish she'd finish up with the Amelia Peabody series and get on to something else...another gothic, perhaps?)",
            "This was a really strange one. Vanish with the Rose had all the elements of a good story - a mystery, a great setting, ghosts, some humor, and best of all lots of cats and dogs as supporting characters. But the whole thing fell flat for me - I didn't hate it but the writing style seemed outdated and the pace was much too leisurely. It was published in 1991 and even though I was (most certainly!) alive and an adult at that time, I had to read up on what was going on with the women's movement. Apparently there was a third wave of feminism during which:...we took back terms that had been hijacked and given derogatory meanings, and we changed their connotations. 'All hail the b*tch philosophy!'...Well, there we go. I guess that explains why the two chicks in this story were such raging assholes to the two guys in the story and I was obviously supposed to be okay with it, because the guys certainly were. They were also okay with the women NOT having sex with them. Four healthy, attractive, unattached humans were living together in a house and no combination of them were getting busy. I am on record as hating to read sex scenes, but this was another strange thing.Lastly, there were too many loose ends and tangents that went nowhere. For example, SO much time was spent on this secret staircase that they found behind the fireplace. Pages and pages devoted to it. Did it have anything to do with solving the mystery? No. They found some broken fragments of a music box and a doll. Big whoop. And a whole long sub-plot about Diana's flirting with a nerdy librarian, you'd think maybe some significant plot point would have come of that, but you would be wrong. There were lots of things like that. So to sum up, if you find this book in a box at a yard sale, go ahead and buy it for a quarter but don't expect to be blown away.",
            "The heroine's objective in passing herself off as an expert in old roses is not clear until about 1/2 of the way through the book (unless you read some of the reviews at the front of the book).The old estate in located in Virginia, where a couple that recently hit the lottery jackpot bought the house from an aging single lady with an eye to restoring the house and the grounds. Only later do we learn that Diana's brother disappeared after living among the townsfolk for a brief period of time, and Diana wants to know what happened to her brother.Good characters, interesting plot twists, and lots of people to cheer for. The person ultimately revealed as responsible for the disappearance of Brad Reed is a surprise, and the mystery is neatly tied up at the end."

            "Ohmigod! Another cliffhanger! This was a teaser for The Fall of Five!!Because I remember her.What?? That's it?? Ahhh can't get enough! I want more!! I'm sooo excited for The Fall of Five! I CAN'T WAIT!! ACCIO AUGUST!!Seriously tho, Adamus Sutekh is one of my favorite characters. He's really amazing and everything about him is interesting. SPOILER ALERT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!I knew it! I knew it! I KNEW IT! I once wrote a tumblr post telling my theories about The Fall of Five and Th Forgotten Ones! So yeah, one of my theories was right! IT WAS THE CHIMAERA! ADAM FINALLY DISCOVERED THEM! You can read my theories about the lorien legacies books on my tumblr: little-miss-artemis.tumblr.comIt's on I Am Number Four tag on my sidebar. Just check it out for more theories! THIS IS DEFINITELY MY FAVORITE SERIES!",
            "It's so cool to see other people's reviews and see how people react differently based on whether they read the short stories before or after the main books.I'm surprised there's so much background for Adam, who was never one of my favorite characters, but I really love seeing pieces of the main story being filled in.",
            "This is another story that follows Adamus Sentrakus. Of the 3 stories about Adam, this is possibly the best of them, although he looks like a weeping child, since he is Mogadian and son of one of him. He spends most of the 3 books complaining, or saying that he is not good enough, or a debilucho, and that he can become tedious at times. This forgotten ones starts where Adam has just dropped the base on his head in an attempt to crush the mogadorians so that Malcolm and Sam can escape. He wakes up in a crater that caused himself, in what remains of the base Sweet, Find another Mog, Rex. He takes Rex of 'Prisoner' and escapes the crater, returning to the collapsed surveillance tower of the previous book. Here and Rex discover a Chimera, Dust, who was also trapped in sweet. The 2 rest for a short period of time, and while resting, Adam finds out about Rex that there were actually dozens of cautive chimeras, all experienced. And this is the rest of the story: Adam's attempt to rescue the chimeras. It is very fun, fast-paced, it has good humor, and there are some really good plot links not only for lost files, but also for the main books. The characters of this story have been better than some of the other books. As I said before, Adam is very weeping, he complains constantly, which is something annoying, the Mog Rex, although he hates traitors and despises Loriens, can not decide which side he is. And the mogadorians, supposedly trained and skillful warriors, are still murdered by thousands for people like a high school girl who is not trained, a MOG traitor who is afraid of weapons and confrontation, 2 girls who have lived in an agreement all his Life and do not have training, and it has no offensive legacies ... I wonder how they managed to bring Lorien first.",
            "The forgotten ones. What can I say?This is my favorite Lost file so far. Hell, yeah! It was the best. I fell in love with the beginning of the book. It begins exactly where The search from Sam ends. He was badly hurt, thirsty, hungry and he find a survivor.  Rexicus Saturnus   I almost die when i read the name. Saturnus?? jajajaj  Plus he find another being.  A quimaera he named Dust  Adam has to find what the Garde needs to win the battle. Something they completely forgot. And he need the help of an 'enemie', so he can find it. Here you'll see how much adam has grew up. he has to make some desicions that can cost his live. And trust people he's supposed not to trust. What I really loved of this e-novella was ADAMUS. He finally accept that One's gone and she'll never come back. And now he trust him self and he knows he can do this. He knows he has the strengh and heart to do what's right. The dude finally realized it!!! He finally knows He can to do it! He became stronger mentally. Y-E-A-H! If you liked the other Lost files. you're definaly gonna love this one. So if you didn't read it yet go and buy it.  ",
            "Again, the story was told in Adam's perspective. I don't know why but as I dwell deeper inside Adam's head, as I become more acquainted with his way of thinking and personality, I get more attached to him. He's quite an exceptional story. And his meeting with Rex makes me realize one vital thing about people. I enjoyed reading this novella immensely. It's short but enthralling and action packed. PS, I feel like it's a teaser of The Fall of Five ",
            "This Lost File is amazing, I can not beat it. With each Last File in which my dear Mog Adam tells me, it makes me fall in love more about him. Although I miss one in the book, and obvious that I am not the only -Adam always is remembering it, think that it is what I would say in the situations in which he is, and the appointment from time to time - I feel that his absence is giving more forces to Adam to continue with his path, since Although she is no longer with him, it is an important motivation to think that she would like and be proud of what he is achieving. The appearance of Rex I liked a lot, and I understand his point of view of things, not I blame for being as it is, since that is the philosophy of life that has been taught since childhood and it is difficult to change everything in what you have always believed from one day for another. And well, the only thing I want now is that it goes out then The Fall of Five and obvious that here, Adam is with the Garde so he can fight with Ell OS against the Mogs and be able to bring them what he has.",
            "Oh Lore! You did it again! As the old adage goes.. once you pop, you can't stop! and now I just can't get enough! I'm super excited for the Fall of Five! I sooo love Adam! I can't wait to see him work with the other Garde! I also liked Rex.. he was a big help in saving the Chimaeras. I can't wait to see the Garde reunite with their Chimaeras! The Lost Files just keep getting better! This book is really in my heart! This is the best of all The Lost Files so far &amp, I loved it from the first page to the last.",
            "Another great Adam short story, I can\u2019t wait until all the parts come back together again.",
            "New developments are yet to reveal themselves. Not all the information is in. No. Don't give up hope just yet. It's the last thing to go. When you have lost hope, you have lost everything. - Henri, I Am Number FourThis companion novella continues the story of Adamus the Mogadorian-turned-ally in his point of view. I love the fact that there is still one good Mogadorian out there.This was definitely a teaser of the 4th book, The Fall of Five.So hurry the eff up, August!",
            "I am super proud of Adam and its evolution, without a doubt my favorite character of the saga."

            "After years of debate the author of this book has been fully discredited as an historian. It has been proven that to try to prove his point about Tom Barry, Hart falsified his alleged sources to fit his narrative. He claimed to have interviewed men whom we know had died long before he could have interviewed them. His second controversial claim (that the IRA did not kill 13 Loyalist informers from Cork as spies but only because they were Protestant) has also been thoroughly disproven. If anything the sole value of this book is that it has demonstrated once and for all that pro-British revisionist historians have been using history, not as an honest appraisal of historical events, but as propaganda meant to re-write history so as to discredit Irish claims to sovereignty. This has been going on for years and will no doubt continue to but this book has shone light on one of the more appalling instances.

The book has plenty of pictures to illustrate authors various arguments. I think the analogy with a tribe sticks very well as by the end of the book I was convinced beyond all doubts. Why no other game has been able to grab the imagination like football had always been one of the many mysteries of my life. Relatively simple rules, team bonding, flow of the game, and arenas are some of the main reasons why football is a clear leader over many other team sports. The book gets rather tedious though because of repetition, and too much detail for someone like me who has some knowledge but no great love of soccer. "

            "Big, ugly, slick haired yellow dog! \ud83d\udc15It is sad. It is heart-breaking. It is painful. Surely, not for the light-hearted. But, it is a classic and a must-read.This is the story of fourteen-year-old Travis, his mother, younger brother Arliss and their dog, Old Yeller. When his father leaves on a cattle drive, Travis has to be \u2018the man of the family\u2019, and is left in charge to take care of his family and their ranch. Travis sets to work on the many tasks around the ranch when one morning he comes to know that the meat in their storehouse has been eaten by a big, ugly, slick-haired yellow dog, who he finds is sleeping on the ground. Travis tries to chase away the dog, but young Arliss insists on keeping it. The dog is named Old Yeller because of his human yelling kind of bark. ***Why does life have to be so painful?I was all over numb, like a dead man walking.\ud83d\ude22\ud83d\ude14",

That makes it all bad\u2026 you understand?This book totally exceeded my expectations. My favourite thing about it was the narrative style - it really felt like I was sitting with the protagonist, Travis, while he was giving me a first hand account of what life was like with Old Yeller. I also laughed out loud at certain parts (mainly the ones having to do with Travis's five year old brother Arlis) and admittedly shed a tear at the end. It was really nice to see Travis progressively take such a liking to Old Yeller after initially being so averse to the whole idea of taking him in as their family's dog.This is such a heartwarming story, and if you're into books about animals, you definitely need to read this.xa0"

            "Old Yeller is a coming of age story about a boy named Travis and his family living in Salt Lick, Texas in the 1860s. Travis is fourteen years old and yearns to be a man. His father is leaving for Abilene on a trip to drive cattle for money, and Travis will be left to man their home until his father returns.\u201cNow, Travis,\u201d he said, \u201cyou\u2019re getting to be a big boy, and while I\u2019m gone, you\u2019ll be the man of the family. I want you to act like one. You take care of Mama and Little Arliss. You look after the work and don\u2019t wait around for your mama to point out what needs to be done.\u201dEven though Travis is now responsible for keeping his mother and younger brother Arliss safe, he\u2019ll also have to keep up with chopping the wood and hunting for food. He feels pretty confident that he can take care of things while his father\u2019s away and looks forward to getting his own horse when his father returns. Not long after, a stray yellow dog shows up and steals some of their meat. Travis is extremely furious about it and wants to hurt the dog, but little Arliss insists they keep him. Travis flat-out doesn\u2019t want a dog again, he had a dog before that died and it was hard for him to get over. Little Arliss is persistent and wins him over. They name the dog Old Yeller.\u201cI guessed that when you are nearly a man, you have to learn to put up with a lot of aggravation from little old bitty kids.\u201dOver time, Old Yeller doesn\u2019t just keep Arliss entertained, he earns his keep and saves their lives multiple times. He\u2019s a wonderful cow dog and great with the hogs too. Travis gets to where he depends on Old Yeller to help him around the land and grows to love him. Travis learns quickly that life on the frontier is often unpredictable and perilous. There are also many daily chores to maintain: keeping animals out of the corn patch, branding hogs, fetching water, hunting, and milking the cow. There\u2019s also a disease known as hydrophobia going around and killing animals which is a big risk for humans too.I read this book when I was in elementary school and decided to read it with my children. I recall being emotional over the book when I was a child, but honestly this time around it wasn\u2019t as sad. The ending is sort of revealed within the first pages which spares the reader in a way. I finally got teary in the end when Travis has a conversation with his dad about Old Yeller.\u201cThat was as rough a thing as I ever heard tell of happening to a boy. And I\u2019m mighty proud to learn how my boy stood up to it. You couldn\u2019t ask any more of a grown man\u2026 It\u2019s not a thing you can forget. I don\u2019t guess it\u2019s a thing you ought to forget. What I mean is, things like that happen. They may seem mighty cruel and unfair, but that\u2019s how life is part of the time. But that isn\u2019t the only way life is. A part of the time, it\u2019s mighty good. And a man can\u2019t afford to waste all the good part, worrying about the bad parts. That makes it all bad.\u201dI enjoy Fred Gipson\u2019s writing as it\u2019s very graphic with detailed descriptions and imagery. You really get a sense of what life was like for this family with all their hard work and difficulties. It\u2019s almost like you\u2019re transported back to this time period on the frontier. It\u2019s a great book to educate children about what life was like back then.We liked the characters in the book, especially Travis. With Travis as the narrator, you feel his emotions as he tells the story and you can see his character grow as he matures tremendously in the little time his father is gone. His mother is supportive and does a fine job caring for the family while their father is away. Little Arliss is a handful and he\u2019s always getting into trouble. He bumps heads with Travis often, but Travis grows to understand him. Burn Sanderson is incredibly kind and respectful. I think the only character we found annoying was Bud Searcy and mainly because he was too chatty and lazy. He wasn\u2019t willing to help, would quickly pass work onto someone else, and basically came around acting like he was there for support. What he really wants is just a free meal.Our hardcover edition is a previous library copy in really good shape. I\u2019m unsure what year this edition is based on the copyright page. It\u2019s definitely not a very old edition because it does list Fred Gipson\u2019s last book and his death in 1973 on the back cover. I believe the first edition publisher was Harper &amp, Brothers. Regardless, this is a classic we\u2019re happy to have. There are a few black and white illustrations throughout but not many.We watched the Disney movie after reading the book and I was surprised with the differences which included a switch up with the ending. There definitely wasn\u2019t as much death and there were some scenes removed altogether. We loved the movie and actually liked the ending in the movie a little better.I was excited to see that there\u2019s a second book titled Savage Sam. We\u2019ll be reading that one next.5*****This book is featured on Shabby Sunday @ https://readrantrockandroll.com/2019/...",
            "This 1950s Pocket edition, purchased from a Sonoma used book store, presented today as a gift to my eight year old daughter (more on this later). After thanking me she asked me what it was about. I told her it's about a boy and his dog. She asked me if the dog dies. I told her he does, but that it is still a good book. She asked if I had read it. I told her I hadn't - only seen the movie. She asked me to read it for her first to make sure it wasn't too sad. She's on to me...Our 14 year-old protagonist Travis comes of age when his father leaves him to be the man of the house while he does a cattle drive from Texas to Kansas. Gipson's frontiersy narrative and dialogue feels right, sounds right, for a book written for children in the 1950s about life in West Texas in the late 1860s. My memories of the movie are hazy, but it seems that the film action follows closely to the written word action, and while there is definitely sadness in the passing of Old Yeller, it doesn't feel like maudlin melancholy. As an eight year old it is the kind of book I would want to read about such weighty subjects as death, grieving, living. When I finished reading it, I handed the novel to my daughter and said, It's not so sad. You'll like it. She's read the entire Laura Ingalls Wilder series. This book is a layup.When traveling my daughter often sees me reading on a Kindle or an iPad. She knows I am reading a book - she also knows that I prefer to read a physical copy rather than an E but that our luggage can only accommodate so many books (here in Florida I've been walking around with Women and Men like a KJV Bible clutched heavily to my chest). She asks when she will be able to read a book on the iPad, I know that in her lifetime a library will be as much of an anachronism as if I had a shelf of VHS tapes - but I want to hold out for as long as I can and help her to experience the tactile enjoyment of the tree book over the ebook. This paperback copy of Old Yeller is 60 years old, in decent shape and is only just showing the ravages of time with yellowing paper and crackling spine glue. While reading the book I hand it to my daughter and ask her to flip the pages under her nose and breath in. She does so, smiles. You'll never get that from an ebook, I tell her. I hope she remembers this.",
            "Let me say first that some love this book and to be fair I never read it except to get an idea of the story. You will find in my books low ratings for Black Beauty, The Yearling, Old Yeller and any books that have the pain of life motif in common. By the way this includes Cold Mountain. Look up my review and you'll see I try to give recognition that it's well written but just not a book I can like. And these ratings are how I feel and what I think of these books. Some will say how they love these books and how possibly there was just no other way to realistically end the story. I grew up in the Smokies and without going over my childhood, I had 2 dogs killed...shot. I've lived through the loss of beloved animals, beloved people and beloved relationships...I don't need a novel that leads me through what pain is. If a book is of the life is tough and then you die school, it's going to get a down check from me. While fiction does instruct, there are some lessons I learned from life, I don't need to have them rehashed in leisure time activities.This book/movie (I know but in this case I'll lump them together) scarred me and I suspect other young people. Ask anyone who has loved a dog (an animal) if the fact that you get a new puppy after you had to kill the dog makes up for it. Maybe this book is well written. I sometimes suspect that many if not most of the people who come to love books like this maybe haven't gone through that pain in life. If you have and you still love this work, well, good. I can not say that.",
            "\u201cNow Travis,\u2019 he said, \u201cyou\u2019re getting to be a big boy, and while I\u2019m gone, you\u2019ll be the man of the family. I want you to act like one. You take care of mama and Little Arliss. You look after the work and don\u2019t wait around for your mama to point out what needs to be done. Think you can do that?\u201d\u201cYessir,\u201d I said.His father had to go away to get some \u201ccash money\u201d by selling his steer. But the boy wanted a horse. The upshot being that if he acted as a man when his father was away, he would be rewarded with his wish upon his father\u2019s return.And on that note his father left with the other steer herders and they went off to the cattle market in Kansas to return in the fall.I acquired this book on another whim. I wanted something \u201clight\u201d to read and I read an excellent review by Jim on Goodreads, so decided this was the book for me and a quick, light read too. How surprised I was when I started reading it and found out what a gem, well in fact it\u2019s more of a gem, it\u2019s a diamond and I absolutely loved it!Here we are in Texas in the late 1860s, to find the settlers who indeed had their work cut out for them in order to survive and bring up their families. I\u2019m terrified of snakes here in France but to think of the wide selection of animals that could be found there on an everyday basis: bobcats, bears, wolves, panthers, rattlers, hogs, coons, etc. plus the odd raiding Indians. I\u2019m not at all surprised that the settlers would naturally have dogs as guard dogs if nothing else. I believe that I would have either stayed indoors all the time, playing the helpless female or look for a good man who wanted to settle in safer climes. But still in the 1860s, I would imagine that a woman\u2019s lot was a hard one and she had very little choice in life, certainly nothing like the 21st century career women with choices galore if they want to take advantage of it.The more I read about fourteen year old Travis\u2019 family, mama and papa, of course, and five year-old Arliss (known as Little Arliss and what a terror he was, constantly causing problems), the more I became engrossed in this exciting, poignant, adventurous and yet magical book. There was the constant thrill of their life be it with an element of death living around the corner, living in a log cabin that the parents had built in a place that they named Birdsong CreekWhen Travis loses his beloved dog Bell in a rather nasty way, he swears he\u2019ll never have another one, even though his father said that it essential for the safety of their daily lives. I know how he felt. When I lost my five year old black Labrador Jasper to a dreadful end, I also swore, no, I\u2019ll never, ever have another dog. That emotional pain and the memories I would never consider again. I can equate this to childbirth. My mother told my father after the birth of my elder brother, no more children, one\u2019s enough but still she went on to have three more children. So Travis although not wanting another dog, unsuspectingly does end up with one, and serendipitously too when one morning he finds Little Arliss playing with this ugly dog in their drinking water. Travis is furious and remembers his father telling him, when he loses Bell, to get another dog and Travis is adamant in that he won\u2019t have it. Nevertheless, his mother is clever, for when his father is away at the cattle market, 600 miles away, with Travis ostensibly in charge (albeit under her watchful eye), she persuades him to let Little Arliss have the dog for company as he will be alone so much as she and Travis will be too busy to play with him. So Travis begrudgingly agrees and slowly begins to love Old Yeller and what a blessing this dog turned out to be. I actually had a lump in my throat from time to time as I continued reading this book.\u201cWe called him Old Yeller. The name had a sort of double meaning. One part meant that his short hair was a dingy yellow, a color that we called \u201cyeller\u201d in those days. The other meant that when he opened his head (a strange turn of phase), the sound he let out came closer to being a yell than a bark.\u201dWe live through the \u201ctrials and tribulations\u201d of the family and Old Yeller surviving involvements with bears and hogs, and some of those sections were quite gruesome.I was amused when I saw that the family ate squirrel because they used to do that here about fifty years ago. I live here in France in \u201crusticana\u201d, about forty miles from a city and this is a land of hunters and fishermen, so I could truly relate to this book.Also the medicinal aspects were interesting, for example, in that when the mother used poultices for wounds she prepared \u201cmashed-up prickly-pear root to draw out the poison\u201d and also horse\u2019s hair for stitching up wounds as it was ostensibly the best.Lisbeth, who came to help out the family latterly when Travis gets involved in an accident, is a strange girl but she turns out well in the end and as for Old Yeller, what a fabulous find he turned out to be, saving the family on various occasions from some possibly very unfortunate outcomes. I could just continue in this vein. The truly sad part is when hydrophobia (rabies I guess) strikes and does the family suffer in that regard.I initially thought that Old Yeller was the catalyst in this book but it is indeed the horse as Travis, through sheer hard work, progresses through the early stages of manhood. The horse will be his ultimate reward when he has proved himself to be a man. The ultimate test for this incredible young man and was I impressed.This is an excellent read for all ages. I have the Kindle version and I\u2019m now going to order a hardback copy so that I can browse through it, as will be my want from time to time.This is an absolutely super read and my only regret is that I would have loved to have read it as a child.",
            "Amazing! There is a reason this book is such a classic. I cried at the end. What a dog that Yeller. A frontier family survive with the help of this scoundrel dog. This book is so grounded and down to earth. They had a lot of ingenuity living on the land as they did. I appreciated how Fred handled the emotions of the characters. Everything and everyone felt so real. I felt like they were living and breathing. Travis's emotional arch is touching. This is a work of art, it really is. I'm so glad I gave this a go. You should too.",
            "A boy, before he really grows up, is pretty much like a wild animal. He can get the wits scared clear out of him today and by tomorrow have forgotten all about it.Of course, everyone my age knows this story. The Wonderful World of Disney, introduced by Mr. Disney himself, fed a whole generation with delights of this sort, just put on the TV at 7:00 on Sunday night and watch something wonderful, but don\u2019t forget because there is no DVR, so if you miss it, you are waiting for summer reruns. Because I knew the story and what to expect, I thought I might not have a really emotional reaction to the end, but alas the two boxes of tissues I bought came in handy. Some of the tears were for the story and the characters and Yeller, of course, but some of them were for that little girl who sat frozen to a flickering TV screen in the living room of a four room house, with her three sisters and her precious mother and father, making a memory that would last all her life."

            "As soon as I saw Simple Crocheting: A Complete How-to-Crochet Workshop with 20 Projects, I was instantly drawn in by it's pretty cover. When I opened Simple Crocheting I was treated to a beautifully presented pattern book.I tend to think *yawn* whenever I see a crochet pattern book that is aimed at beginners. I like to be challenged when I crochet and I will get easily bored if I see patterns that are too simple. That is not the case here at all. Designer Erika Knight has created a pattern book that beginners can follow, yet seasoned crocheters can enjoy as well. Aside from the well written patterns, I love Erika's style of writing. I read this pattern book cover to cover. The photography in this pattern book is as the title suggests, simple, yet it is beautiful. I love the presentation.It is the simplicity of crochet that inspires me. With just a few basic stitches worked either in lines or round and round, using only a hook and some yarn you can create seemingly endless textures. With only one stitch ever in work on the hook, it is a deceptively simple craft that anyone can master, as well as being conveniently portable.p.6, Simple CrochetingThe patterns in the book range from very easy to a bit more entailed. The skill levels are Beginner, Easy, Intermediate and Experienced. The book contains an Introductory section, Materials and Techniques and a Stitch Library. I enjoyed reading Erika's take on choosing the right yarns in the Materials and Techniques section. She favors crocheting with natural fibers and has her own line of natural yarns.The patterns in the book, which are called Project Workshops, incorporate the different techniques in crochet. There's a Basics section with patterns like Simple Dishcloth and Laptop Cover and a Shaping section with patterns like Triangular Scarf and Slipper Boots. Also included is a Motifs section with patterns for a Traditional Square Motif Throw and a Patchwork Motif Blanket.The patterns are written out clearly, the photographs will inspire you and you can use the stitch guide for reference. The projects in this book, Simple Crocheting, are very much my take on crochet. This book is not intended as an exhaustive wikipedia on the minutiae of crochet. Instead it is as simple introduction of the craft, to set you on your way to mastering techniques, selecting yarns, and considering color palettes. I have pared down the craft to the essentials as I see them with the aim of providing the means to get you crocheting.p.6, Simple CrochetingOne project in particular caught my eye, the Rag Pet Bed. I know my chihuahua would be right at home in something like this. This bed is actually worked up by crocheting with fabric strips instead of yarn, which gives the project a nice, rustic look. Erika provides a section in her book on how to make yarn from fabric strips, which is pretty simple to do. Overall I found Simple Crocheting: A Complete How-to-Crochet Workshop with 20 Projects to be a beautifully presented crochet pattern book, with a nice variety of patterns and photographs that will inspire crocheters to pick up those hooks and yarn and start creating. This book and this designer are new favorites!Disclaimer:This review is my honest opinion. I did not receive any type of compensation for reading and reviewing this book. While I receive free books from publishers and designers, such as this one, I am under no obligation to write a positive review.",
            "Another great book by Erika Knight. Easy to follow along and beautiful projects! ",
            "The folks at St. Martin\u2019s Press sent me a review copy of Erika Knight\u2018s Simple Crocheting: A Complete How-to-Crochet Workshop with 20 Projects, which takes an artsy approach to sharing the basics of crochet, using a combination of step-by-step illustrations, fashion friendly projects, and design tips from an established knitwear designer.What I like about this book:The book layout is designed to appeal to your inner artist. A harmonious, neutral color palette ties together all the projects and the swatches. \u201dRipped\u201d pages with notes are photographed atop swatches, projects are photographed beautifully, etc.The book includes a nice introductory stitch guide.Several of the patterns include a \u201cmasterclass\u201d section where additional tips and variations are provided.Although the book is aimed at beginners, it includes beginner, easy, and intermediate level projects, so you can \u201cgrow\u201d with the book.What I don\u2019t like or what could be improved:The book relies on illustrations to teach the crochet skills. If you don\u2019t learn as easily from illustrations, this may be a challenge.The book is paperback so it doesn\u2019t lay flat for reading and crocheting. However, it does include cover flaps so you can mark your place.Overall:Simple Crocheting is beautiful book that will inspire you to improve your crochet skills. Many beginners will need to supplement the book with YouTube or online photo tutorials since illustrations are sometimes unclear to a newbie. If you are a beginner who is inspired by the look of well photographed projects, this might be the beginner crochet book for you."

At first, 12-year-old Luz balks, hardly thrilled by the prospect of actually having to walk to the mall. But Luz doesn't mope for long. After all, her name --- pronounced ?loose? --- means ?light.? Soon, this intelligent and spirited chica begins to understand that she must change with the times. As food prices rise, Luz decides to help create a more self-sustainable community by transforming a run-down city lot into a garden where she and her neighbors can grow their own fruits and vegetables. But when she solicits help from her friends --- boy-crazy Anika and computer-whiz Robby --- they think she's a little loco. Luz pedals her idea on the street, but the community is equally dismissive. Can Luz pull off her plan and help change her world alone? This graphic novel is a kid-friendly take on sustainable living in a fossil fuel-dependent world. Preteens will love the fearless, fiery and resourceful heroine and will find inspiration in her efforts to steer her society toward self-sustainable living. Hip and energetic illustrations bring Luz and her world to life in a jazzy, appealing fashion, and a bonus chapter teaches kids how to make garden compost.",

            "So Luz Sees the Light is a bit heavy handed in the green message. But I would highly recommend this work for 4th grade and above, and I surely recommend this work for the teachers on the ISD campus running the green garden, composting, and promoting the community garden behind the ISD Library. I love to see the ISD students pushing their wheel barrows back to the compost bin! I think if students saw themselves in this book, they might be even more into their own composting and gardening goals. Luz cleans up an empty lot, brings benches, mulch, planters, and a composting bin to the neighborhood. But more than that, she makes the connection between the cost of her imported food and depleting energy resources. Luz's enthusiasm is infectious and slowly but surely, she converts her friends and neighborhood to greener living."

            "This is a graphic novel intended, I think, for young readers. It was on a list of great feminist books for young readers and I read it because I've no idea what is appropriate for young readers (or how old one must be to fit in that category) and curious about what feminist means.Luz lives in a kind of dystopian Sesame Street where gas prices are completely out of control, there are blackouts all the time, food prices are crazy but it is relatively safe to hang out on the street during the blackouts. Luz is blissfully ignorant of all this, demanding rides to the mall for designer shoe shopping trips, but eventually sees the light and makes a difference in her community through good works.The age range is 8-12 and the material seems appropriate. The graphic novel format makes it an easy read but the content is at the edge of preachy (for one who is not 8-12 anymore, at least). Feminist seems to be strong female character who does good through her own initiative - also reasonable though she doesn't do it alone and I think I like that aspect of the book most.",
            "What I did like: The illustrations are fun. The muted mono-color with sharp black and white lines color scheme lends itself to a story that takes place during blackouts and Luz is a natural consumerist and reluctant environmentalist.What I didn't like: It's VERY DIDACTIC and does not disguise it's messages about energy consumption, sustainability and other environmental concerns.That said, when I was young I had this fact-based coloring book on the environment and I loved it. I loved filling in all the gallons of water it took to take a single shower and because the memory of this is still so vivid for me, I assume it has informed my current environmental perspective. Should work in a school setting, but I'm not sure if kids will get into for fun. As usual, I say, Let the kids decide. ",
            "When I think about this book, I find myself trying to decide if it's too didactic. And honestly, I kind of feel like if I have to ask that question, it probably is. But when I think about what I read as a kid, I realize that I read a lot of didactic literature. And I enjoyed it. I liked reading message stuff in the comic medium WAY better than reading narrative nonfiction. Comics was how I consumed lots of information. So I'm not sure this book deserves to die just because it has an agenda. For kids curious about the effects of global warming, this would probably be awesome.Here's what I liked:1. Luz. She's not white! AND does not conform to gender stereotypes!2. Silly subplots involving computers and rabbits and young love.3. The slightly future time period. Blackouts are getting more frequent. Gas prices are around $7 a gallon. Yay for casually incorporating speculative elements into J comics!And what I didn't like:1. Colors. At first, I enjoyed the brown and black coloring in depicting the blackout. But once we got back to a powered world, I wanted things to change. A green accent color would have been awesome at the end, for example. 2. No acknowledgement of the work involved in keeping up a community space/garden that ends up being created. It's a big deal that they're DONE. And no system is mentioned for making sure things will be maintained. I enjoyed the urban setting, but I'm not sure kids in my area will relate to it, so I think I'll be booktalking other things.",
            " Luz Sees the Light is a rather didactic graphic novel aimed at kids eight to twelve that talks about environmentalism and the need to save and conserve energy and gas. Luz lives in a city where gas prices soar and power outages are common, so probably somewhere in California. After some complaining, as any semi-oblivious twelve-year-old would do, Luz thinks about what she can do, and decides to start a community garden in a vacant lot near her house. Her friends think she's crazy and her community dismisses her, but Luz perseveres and eventually makes a real difference in the world.This is not a subtle book, guys. But then again, no one ever said it had to be subtle. I'd go young on this one, though, it's too preachy for the older crowd. Still, it's a cute book and well illustrated, and good for an introduction to environmentalism.",
            "Luz is annoyed that her mom wants her to walk to the local mall. Can't they just drive? Also, why can't they get her favorite foods at the grocery store? Her mom explains that oil is growing more scarce--so gas prices are rising, food prices are increasing, and power outages are going to become more frequent. Luz decides to take matters into her own hands and help her community become a little more self-sustainable by transforming an abandoned trash-filled lot into a park and community garden. Can she convince her friends and neighbors to help?A cute graphic novel that approaches concepts of reusable resources and helping the environment in a kid friendly way. This book is about ten years old, so a few of the factoids about fuel emissions and the like feel a little dated, but the message is still good. I was a little confused about the power outages--the book seemed to connect these to the lack of oil, but they also seemed to be timed to Luz's fluctuating emotions, and for a few pages it felt like the book was going to take a mystical turn that didn't pan out.

            "My Review: I am so frustrated with this book all the characters with the exception of Cal need to get out. I have never been more disappointed with a book/series in all my life. I wanted to pick this book up and throw it against a wall. Kittredge let us down. She did, she combined Science and Magic without it being all about Alchemy. She introduced these complex characters that were at times frustrating but sympathetic and ultimately I was on their side. She introduced these cosmic monster gods which I knew would be what Aoife would have to face. And then she dropped the ball. I don't know if she just got bored with her own story or if she realized she had too many ideas and couldn't tie them up in the end but it was a disaster. This was the last book in the trilogy. I'm livid, what was the point of introducing the monster gods if you were never going to use them? The whole resolution was shakey at best, it left so many things unanswered and created more annoying questions that you know will never be answered. I'm so angry, there was almost nothing redeemable about this book, in fact I will go as far as to say there wasn't anything redeemable about it.Overall Rating: 1/7",
            "Overall, I liked this book. Was it my favourite book of all time? No. Was it a decent sci-fi, dystopian, alternative history? Mostly yes. There were some things that I liked--the expanded world, the Deadlands sounded pretty interesting, though some of that was a little underdeveloped. There were some things I didn't like: Aoife's mopeyness (that sounds horrible to say but sometimes she just got way too freakin' maudlin. I have to have Dean back. I can't survive without him. Wah wah wah, not direct quotes but the give the gist. I understand grief--trust me, do I ever. I understand losing someone you really loved and how it leaves a hole in your heart that can never be filled and won't just get better with time. I'm not diminishing her grief. But her steady belief that she just couldn't survive without Dean was annoying to me. In many other ways she's a very strong character, and I can understand that losing someone you love is incredibly painful, but you can survive that. I did. Many, many other people have. Losing someone is not the end of the world. Maybe if Aoife had come at the whole getting-Dean-back quest as trying to write a wrong since she feels responsible for his death--which was understandable and believable--then I wouldn't have had so many quibbles. But for her to just unilaterally state over and over that she just couldn't survive without him is stupid and a little degrading. Obviously she could survive. She was surviving. Every time she insisted that she couldn't live without him made me want to slap her. End rant), glaring plot holes Umm, why even have Dean with her when she gave herself up to the Brotherhood at the end? The other guys hid or disappeared, why didn't Dean? It's not like any of the Brotherhood goons knew he was alive, I doubt Draven did either. So why did he come with her just so he could be used as a bargaining chip? That was stupid and a little nonsensical to me. Also, not telling her father that she met her uncle in the Deadlands? Weird. Not fulfilling her promise to Madame Xiang? Weird and probably a little dangerous. I know they left right away--and what happened with Chang after that? Did he just go back to taking care of the crazy doctor? Did Xiang and the tong try to exact vengeance for Aoife leaving without stating whether she fulfilled her promise?--but it just seemed a little strange to have that be in the story and be remarked on twice (with some threat underlying it like she'd be hurt if she didn't come through) and then to never deliver on it. I know Aoife had bigger problems (at least to her mind) but that's kind of a dick move to make a promise like that to someone who suddenly decided not to kill you or turn you over to the tong and then not fulfill it. Also the whole defeat of Nylarthotep (sheesh that name) was a little confusing and slightly deus ex machina especially in that it seemed like it put back the threat of the Old Ones (at least according to some people) but then not really (add to the confusion when one page it's like yay, the Old Ones aren't coming and things are getting better and then Crow's back like No, they're still coming and things 'bout to get cray-cray. It was very jarring that that all happened very close together) when they came into Aoife's dream later and threatened them. Crazy ending that, especially as this is the last book in the series (or so it's been said). It's kind of a cliffhanger which wasn't necessarily bad in that it was far more interesting than some of the chapters before, but it was just a little weird and off. Not sure if the author is planning to continue the story in some other fashion but if not it just seems a little odd to end it that way. Anyway end spoiler rant. From some of my rant you might construe that I didn't like the book, but I did. It wasn't bad. It just had a lot of unfulfilled potential, especially considering how I like the first book. There were just some things that were like annoying little gnats flitting around my head while reading (and not just in this book but in the other two as well). Aoife (and others) prides herself on being smart and cool and rational but she makes some really dumb decisions throughout the series that have crazy bad consequences for everyone. Now, I'm not saying that the author shouldn't have done that, Aoife's mistakes show us she's flawed and human (mostly) and a teenager who doesn't know everything. But I often found myself getting annoyed at Aoife during this book and the one before when others would constantly throw her mistakes in her face and she'd just shrivel up and apologise and almost whimper over how much she'd messed things up. 1. This irritated me because, a lot of the time, the people who were harping on how bad she messed up were her father and brother who are partly to blame for all that (mostly because her father didn't raise her and train her like he should have and then yells at her for not knowing the things he never taught her. Really? She was supposed to just intuit everything magically? Don't be a jerk, Archie. And as for Conrad, all his snide little comments about Aoife messing up really pissed me off. Yo, Connie, you went crazy and tried to kill your sister and then you sent her some cryptic crazy letter that sent her chasing after you. Who's the bad sibling here? Look in the mirror), but it was also troubling how few times Aoife told them off for treating her like some ill-behaving child. She was doing the best with what little information she had and I really wanted her to just tell them all to shut up or offer something constructive rather than Gee, look at all these messes you've made Aoife.And speaking of Conrad, kid pull yourself together. I know you've got this whole mixed-heritage, crazy mother, abandoning father thing going on but stop taking out your bad attitude on your sister who's already got enough on her plate. It really pissed me off (and I think it should've pissed Aoife off a little more, too) when Conrad got his shackles up and basically told Aoife to leave Graystone (I will refrain from making a He-Man joke, I swear) and never come back. Then a few chapters later he's rescuing her from prison in Alcatraz (umm, why on earth have her sent to Alcatraz if you were just going to rescue her ten minutes later? Can you say under-utilized awesome setting?) and acting like she should have known he was going to come help her. Dude, you were sending some seriously mixed messages if somehow she was supposed to equate Leave and never come back! with I'll follow you like a creepy stalker and then swoop in for the rescue when you need it. I feel like he could've been a much more interesting character but instead he was this disjointed, bad-tempered, annoying brother I could never actually come around to liking. Not even at the end when he and Aoife made up. If he plans to stay in Iron and go to college, someone needs to get with making some kind of fix for his iron poisoning so he's not constantly flipping out on everyone else, because that'll get you kicked outta school real quick, Connie.So, other than some of the very unnecessary drama Dean, I'm looking at you, dude. That whole I'm just gonna leave because I don't want you risking your life for me again and obviously you're not smart enough to determine if that's a good thing or not so I'll just make that decision for you, little lady was beaucoup de annoying and I'm glad Aoife called you on your crap. She just risked dying to rescue you. Now's the time to say thank you, I love you, and let's get married. Though maybe wait on that last one because you're really young. Also tell her Dad to buzz off about looking all judgmental when you guys kiss. She just saved you twice, kissing is more than in order and Dad needs to back off, this was a decent read. There were several characters that seemed like they were going to be a big deal and then were woefully underused (Madame Xiang, Chang, Doctor Death, Ian Graystone, Ariadne) and some characters that were brought back that weren't really needed other than to add some mustache-twirling (Draven) and some threads left hanging which seem to indicate some kind of sequel and some characters who could've used major rewrites to make them a little more relatable, which all contributed to this being less than a stellar book. But it wasn't horrible. It didn't make me want to tear my hair out. It did make me roll my eyes more than once (kinda a lot especially when Aoife got all morose and emo) but it was a decent book. I'm kinda glad the series is over (I hope. Or if it's not, please just short stories and novellas where one thing can be focused on rather than five-million disjointed things that don't seem to get the full treatment they deserve). And now, finally, end of rantish review."

            "Today\u2019s post is on The Mirrored Shard by Caitlin Kitteredge. It is the last novel in the Iron Codex trilogy. It is 295 pages long and is published by Delacorte Press. The cover has the main character, Aoife, looking at the reader with dramatic makeup on to make her more exotic, she looks older and more confident than on the other covers. The intended reader is young adult female but anyone who like Lovecraft or lovecraftian horror should enjoy this series. There is no sex or language in this book but there is some violence and graphic horror descriptions. There Be Spoilers Ahead.From the book jacket- When Dean was shot and killed in the Arctic north, he was ripped not only from the Iron Lands but from Aoife Grayson\u2019s life. Aoife has sworn to bring her love back, even if she must face death to do it. But she can\u2019t get to the Deadlands on her own. And even if she can get there, her foe, Tremaine, will surely block her escape, it is his job to hold her in the Thorn Land, the fairie home of her mother, Nerissa. Aoife has never shied away from a fight. She\u2019ll do whatever she must to get out of the Thorn Land and to the Deadlands. But to rescue Dean, she must also face the other catastrophe that took place in the north. She must stop the apocalyptic chain of events she set in motion when she opened the Gate to the nightmare realm. Because if she doesn\u2019t, there will be no world to bring Dean back to.Review- This is the last novel in a trilogy that I have been reading as it has come out. It is a good book but it did not feel like the end of a trilogy to me. I can tell that Kitteredge is gearing up for the next series of novels about this world and Aoife. I have no problem with writing more in a world and this world is interesting and complex but I really wish that she had really ended this series. In the end the Old Ones are still coming, they have promised Aoife that they will get to the Iron Land in her lifetime. So with that as the end I know that the series is not finished. That is not the only way that makes this novel feel like it was rushed or just not finished. The other books are over 400 pages in length and this one is not even 300. Encounters with big, scary things were neither big or scary. I was disappointed with this book. I expected so much from this novel because the others were so good. It was not bad but it was not the best in the series. I will read the next in the series but I am glad that it will be about a year before the next book comes out so that I can get over this disappointment.I give this one Three out of Five Stars. I get nothing for this review and I borrowed this book from my local library.",
            "The Mirrored Shard (Iron Codex Series #3) The Mirrored Shard opens on an Aoife much different than before. After everything that has brought her to this point in the series, she is a shell of her former self. With Dean gone, the world descending into madness, and her essentially being the cause for it all, I can't deny her demeanor was easy to understand. Still, I instantly missed the Aoife from the other stories. Strong and witty Aoife. I crossed my fingers that things would resolve themselves, and read on.xa0Now, what first drew me into this series was the world building. Kittredge's writing would flow onto the pages, and I was so drawn in to Lovecraft that I couldn't look away. She built a world where I was able to visit an airship and meet some Fae in the same breath. So imagine my chagrin when I realized that The Mirrored Shard was lacking the descriptive writing I fell in love with. Actually, it is still here. Just less of it. I wanted more of the eerie Deadlands, more of the cold and calculating Fae.xa0Which brings me to my final issue, and in truth the reason why this book garnered fewer stars than the previous two for me: the plot. In previous books Aoife's adventures have always been daring and grand. Filled with danger, narrow escapes, and requiring quick thinking on her part. I loved the camaraderie between the characters. In The Mirrored Shard, I felt like a lot of that was pressed into the background. Aoife is so focused on getting Dean back that she acts much like a petulant child most of the time. The Fae, the Old Ones, everything that kept the story moving, is shoved back for Dean's rescue. It just felt off.xa0That's not to say that I didn't enjoy this book. There were portions that shone for me, and others that were slow to get through. I will admit that I was very glad to see everything finally wrapped up neatly. I wouldn't say no to another book, especially because I'd love to see where things go with Aoife. For now, I'll say goodbye to this series with a smile on my face. Thank you to Caitlin Kittredge for allowing me to escape into Lovecraft. I can't wait to see what comes next.",
            "*Warning this review may contain spoilers*I'm sad to see this series end, but at the same time I think if there were more books they might not be as good as these three. I started this series late, they have been on my to-read list for quite a while and I'd heard nothing but good things about them.As soon as I finished the last two books I immediately went online and ordered the next. Caitlin Kitteredge certainly has an amazing talent with writing. Its unfortunate that the books seem to get smaller as the series went on, this book was about 300 pages whereas the first was just under 500 pages.I didn't realize until the end this book that each book involved Aoife was constantly searching for someone. The first book it was her brother, the second, her mother and finally Dean. You'd think that it may get old but I was still as captured as I was when I first began.My only problem with this book is that we never found out why Dean was trapped in the prisons while he was in the deadlands. It was stated that only the really bad and evil end up in those cells, murderers etc. But we never do find why Dean was locked up. At that point I was expecting a bit of a plot twist, for example that he maybe had been working for someone all along. That maybe, him meeting Aoife and Cal in the Iron Thorn wasn't a mistake but all a part of a master plan. I didn't think that his feelings were fake, I thought that maybe he fell in love with her and was planning to abandon the plan.All in all I was very happy with the ending. I'm a massive fan of happy endings so I won't complain about how it was finished. "

            "The Last Warrior is the sub-title of the book &amp, it\u2019s around 50% of the book which is solely dedicated to Saigo Takemori who was the \u201clast Samurai\u201d &amp, who was finally defeated in 1877 with the failure of the Satsuma rebellion.It reads like a novel rather than a history text in the opening chapters as the author injects his brand of humour within the narrative which is mostly sound in his attempt to be \u201cdown with the kids\u201d \u2013 you\u2019ll see what I mean should you pick this up. The first half gives a fair bit of pre-amble which relay modern day scenarios to the way of the samurai..... chapters are brief &amp, give some insight into what makes a samurai or components of their way of life....... We have a chapter on training a young mind, a section on the religion Shinto, an all too small chapter on the samurai sword, Seppuku..... early origins, creation &amp, history of Japan, America\u2019s \u201cinvasion\u201d of Japan, Bushido code...... However every chapter jus touches on the subject matter &amp, Its not deeply detailed giving the reader jus enough insight to see the machinations of a Samurai. It also covers western influence on its culture especially an American \u201cforced\u201d trade agreement which ended nearly 250yrs (1600-1850) of isolation of Japan from the outside world bar a few Dutch traders. This chapter helps to set-up the reasoning of the revolt &amp, how Saigo became it\u2019s leader.About Saigo himself there are plenty of anecdotes &amp, written accounts in the narrative &amp, the author certainly has does his homework but I must admit I would have liked some more counter from the other side to balance out the tale &amp, turn it more into a story as at times it reads purely like a homage to the man which for me wasn\u2019t that appealing come the end.Some part entertaining, other parts monotonous..... a so it\u2019s 2.5pts rounded upto a three as at times it\u2019s an alright account.

            "The preface identifies that this book is three stories, intertwined. Primarily, it is the story of Saigo Takamori - known as the Last Samurai. Although this immediately conjures the movie of the same name, staring the midget scientologist, put that from your mind. It is far from fact, and should be disregarded.For the most part, the book is a biography. The second story referred to, is the story of Japanese history from their isolation to the Meiji Restoration and the Satsuma Rebellion, and the third story is that of Samurai, and the end of their heritage. To be fair, the second and third stories are really told in the context of Saigo's biography.Saigo is a complex character, and this era of Japanese history is complicated. Saigo ends up on both sides of the complex argument, ultimately establishing the army that in turn ends up running him down as a rebel, and results in his death. The author manages to work through the complexities and explains each step in the politics, and the role of the daimyos, the shogun and the Emperor.The writing is simple, the story is well organised, and the background and technicalities are introduced at the right time, and in the right level of detail - not so much as to sidetrack the story, but enough to provide an understanding to maintain the story. There are a lot of plenty of photographs, some in colour others in b&amp,w scattered through the text.3 stars.",
            "Interesting and a fast read, about Saigo Takamori, The Last Samurai, who led the Satsuma Rebellion against the Meiji government of Japan in 1877. I would have liked more depth in the treatment of this subject, but, what I liked about it, was that Man followed in the footsteps of Saigo, mainly on the southern island of Kyushu, so I enjoyed the travelogue aspect of the story. A much better retelling of the story of Saigo is to be found as a chapter in Ivan Morris' The Nobility of Failure: Tragic Heroes in the History of Japan.",
            "An excellent biography of Saigo, the true last samurai. Really unsure why Hollywood chose to replace him with a Westerner in the movie. His story was just as moving and poignant as was his redemption after death. Saigo was quite the walking contradiction, easily showing that few things in this human world are black and white. The author has the knack for educating and providing sources while making it sound like you're sitting across from him at a pub while he tells you the story. Really am unsure why the intro to this book's entry on Goodreads et al reads: The definitive history of the Samurai it's really just the biography of Saigo. Nonetheless, a really well done and excellently written biography. It does lose one star for me in its false advertising of being a history on the Samurai class. ",
            "As others have indicated, the title of this book is a little deceptive. Though the author does give some general background on samurai and their culture, the book is mostly about Saigo and his role in a period of rapid change in Japan in the late 1800's. The author does a good job of explaining the complex politics and interplay of the daimyos, samurai, shogun, foreigners, and emperor. I've been interested in the medieval period of the daimyos and shoguns, and this book showed me the denouement of that time period. The author also does a good job characterizing Saigo's personal traits of loyalty and honor and how that led him to his final resistance to the new centralized government. The last chapters of the book are the best, as they describe Saigo's final military actions.Still, if you're looking for a history and detailed description of the samurai, this isn't the book for you. Also, the style of the book is a little jumpy, moving confusedly from descriptions of episodes in Saigo's life, to general details about samurai culture, to modern-day scenes as the author travels Japan.",
            "Bit of an odd title for the book. Primarily the book is a biography of Saigo Takamori, and only for the first hundred pages or so are there chapters dealing with particular historic concepts and situations - featured every second chapter.Despite its misleading nature, it\u2019s still interesting. The writing style wasn\u2019t my cup of tea either, with its more \u201cstory-telling\u201d format, but regardless it got its job done",
            "Interesting, informative, reasonably detailed, although in truth this book really should have been retitled Saigo the Last Samurai Warrior. Otherwise by the title Samurai the Last Warrior A History the reader is actually under the impression that this book is about a history of the samurai. Other samurais are in the background of this book and the history period is not as long therefore as one thinks. Apart from a very misleading title and a very misleading caption in the photograph section page 178 of the top photo, that's not Toshiro Mifune and in the film Seven Samurai he's not the leader of the ronin, Takashi Shimura is the leader, his character wasn't even a samurai! His character was a farmer, not just a villager, and he was after rewards not for a cause. Unfortunately the beginning line on page one is also somewhat off putting. It is true that George Lukas found some pieces here and there to meld into his movie franchise but there certainly wasn't/isn't anything to get carried away by. I have read John Man before and he usually is quite good."

            "(Assigned reading for a class on how to teach history.) Basically the biography of a low level civil rights worker in St. Louis, Ivory Perry, who was essentially a 'soldier' in the civil rights 'war,' one who never gave up the fight even after others had stopped. Perry was a man essentially forgotten by history till he pushed himself forward to the author (Lipsitz) at a photo show of historical civil rights images, many of which were pics of Perry. This fact prompted the author to write this book about Perry and the part he played in the movement. As such, the book falls squarely into the micro-history movement, where instead of focusing on great generals of history when looking at a war the historian focuses instead on the experiences of the average soldier, or even his wife.While the author claims his intent is to be fair and balanced, it's clear that he romanticizes and idolizes his central character, and puts him up on a pedestal as a martyr to the good fight. A member of the proletariat attempting to rise up against the bourgeoisie (and yes the Marxist analysis runs thick if you know what you're looking at). This is most evident in the last two chapters, but is a underlying current running through the whole book.For myself, while I tasted the kool-aid, at most all it did was give me a bellyache. Throughout the book the author says things like, 'while many might look at Perry and see a sad loser who couldn't function in normal society, what I see is....'Sorry, but what I saw was a guy who happened to stumble upon a context that gave him a purpose and a practical way to feed his addiction for stimulants... in this case adrenaline. To me, when I look at Perry what I see is a guy who suffers from PTSD from two tours in Korea who was was able to find a venue where his need for conflict and danger was not only met, but rewarded, in the same way that it would have been on the battle field. Only, he ran into the same problems as on the battle field, an inability to take direction and follow orders, and a tendency to get into conflicts with his commanding officers, which stymied any attempt on his part to become more than cannon fodder in the battle.There are other aspects of the book however that ring true. I have a handful of friends, who like Perry, are life long civil rights activists, and have been at it for over twenty years. My friends are not 'organic' intellectuals, folks without a traditional education whose language becomes so political that its hard to have a normal conversation with them (you know the type, angry young men who read marx and spout theory rather than thoughts). My friends are, instead, of the more traditional type, they are folks who knew starting out what they wanted to do with their lives, got degrees at top universities and then devoted their lives to things like the UN, the state department, working with Native Americans tribes, teaching in the inner city, working as public defenders, etc. All of them essentially taking vows of poverty, or near poverty, and focusing instead on more ineffable rewards. Lipsitz descriptions of the strains of on these people and what happens to them over time, all rang very true for me."

Lipsitz's portrayal of a life-long activist and organic intellectual whose commitments were always to his communities, not personal gain or an organization echoes Barbara Ransby's of Ella Baker. In focusing on a singular actor, both books expand to present the larger history and context of struggle that made Ivory Perry, and Ella Baker, respectively. ",

            "UPDATE 2/1/15: Designing Library Spaces (review at Hack Library School)I appreciate that the book's structure more or less follows the design process, but it made for some awkward fits between chapter divisions, libraries, and topics. And it often seems that the wealth of material was too much for one small book to do justice. Still, I would recommend this title as a teaching text for library and architecture school classes, preferably studio-based. Planning to elaborate on this brief review in a post for Hack Library School, will link here when it's published."

To keep the threat of disease to a minimum, the colony adheres to strict laws, including the prohibition of same-sex relationships. , When the same fatal virus seems to appear again, Neal and Dylan find themselves in the midst of an irrational panic and hate that threatens to destroy everything the colonists have worked so hard to attain.",

            "Operation Starseed was JM Snyder's first novel and the third one I've read. It is set in space, both on a station and on a distant colony world. It's part romance and part social commentary and all space opera.Neal James works as a radio operator taking in calls from passing ships and relaying their messages as needed. The one voice he doesn't expect to hear is his ex, Dylan Teague. To further complicate things Dylan and Neal end up assigned to the same mission to check out radio signals from a Starseed colony ship years after the program was closed and deemed a failure.On the romance front you have lots of awkward make-up sex in tight and semi-hostile quarters. Some of the scenes are juvenile at times but I think deep space just one you go stupid sometimes. I found the constant referring to each other as that boy out of character for both men but that is a minor quibble for otherwise interesting and well rounded personalities.The colony itself brings to play the social commentary aspect of the novel. The survivors have developed a very strict society as a means for continued survival. Something killed most of the original colonists the taboos are there to prevent that ever happening. Unfortunately when you get outsiders you get unintentional taboo breaking and consequences for everyone.Despite a few pacing issues, I enjoyed the book. I like how Snyder mixes science fiction and romance. ",
            "Neal James is a navigator on a ship out in the far reaches of space. It's been two months since his ex-lover Dylan Teague left on a two year starmapping mission. For the first time since they were separated Neal is the one on duty when Dylan calls in. Dylan's ship has intercepted a transmission in Morse code apparently sent as a welcome message for travelers in this distant part of space.While Neal at first doesn't share Dylan's belief that the signal is from a colonizing ship lost in space over twenty years ago he soon finds himself joining Dylan on a search mission for the Operation Starseed spaceship. When Dylan sees Neal again he realizes he was wrong to break up with him even though he thought it was for the best since they would be apart for so long. Neal is happy to know that Dylan still loves him as he never stopped loving him.Things go bad however when they find the lost colonists on the planet they've been living on since they crashed. Of the original colonists only the children, now grown, survived an unknown disease that swept through the planet they're living on. What follows is a race against the clock to prevent a possible outbreak of the dangerous virus from killing them and the surviving colonists. Neal and Dylan must also contend with the hatred of most of the colonists towards them as they view their homosexuality as a crime.J.M. Snyder has written a lovely story, fast-paced and gripping, yet sweet and loving as well. Neal and Dylan are well-developed characters and the secondary characters also bring a lot to the story. I enjoyed this book very much as I have other books written by this author."

This book is based on that idea and does a decent job at presenting the relevant material. Each chapter presents a concept and gives several examples. It was easy to follow due to the 9x9 board. The book also comes with a CD from the American Go Association. A good book for those wanting to learn Go on a smaller board, instead of a full size 19x19 board.",

Rhetoric formed an essential part of teaching and general culture. Today it gives indispensable keys to addressing current problems in literary theory, philosophy and aesthetics, communication, and political or legal debate. It bears a body of knowledge about reasoning and language, a vocabulary still in use, and transcends traditional barriers between disciplines and periods.,Written by a leading scholar of classical rhetoric, Laurent Pernot, the book offers a full description of ancient rhetoric in the Greco-Roman period, from Homer and classical Athens, through the Hellenistic World, Roman Republic, and Roman Empire, up to the advent of Christianity, explaining the evolutions, illuminating the main themes, and stressing the key moments and figures. The book contains a thesaurus giving a list and explanation of all the technical terms, many of which are still in use in contemporary language.,Laurent Pernot is Professor of Greek Language and Literature at the University of Strasbourg and President of the International Society for the History of Rhetoric. He is the author of numerous books and articles.,Praise for the book:,\"Laurent Pernot's concise and authoritative account of rhetoric in Graeco-Roman antiquity appears now in an elegant English translation by William Higgins. This translation goes well beyond the original French edition and is more than a guide to what the Greeks and Romans thought about speech. Terminology and practice are given equal weight. Pernot has included detailed discussion of problematic issues in an excursus format that enriches his exposition without disrupting it. This is by far the best and the most timely introduction to classical rhetoric known to me.\"--G. W. Bowersock, Institute for Advanced Study (Princeton),\"Pernot is one of the leading historians of rhetoric worldwide, and what he says demands serious consideration. He possesses encyclopedic knowledge of the period, and he writes clearly and cleanly. The book is excellent, in scholarly quality and in accessibility.\"--Craig Kallendorf, Texas A&M University,\"A splendidly nuanced treatment of ancient rhetoric both as theory and practice. Pernot's mastery of contextual detail enlivens his discussions of individual orators, putting human faces on the public texts that have survived from Greek and Roman societies.\"--James J. Murphy, University of California, Davis\"Pernot offers many new interpretations of the history of rhetoric, adds nuance and discrimination to many previous understandings, and overturns or takes us past a series of understandings that prevailed earlier; in each case he does so on the basis of the most respectable and current scholarship.\"--Lawrence D. Green, University of Southern California,\"A comprehensive, concise, yet never simplistic overview of ancient rhetorical practice and theory. . . . An exemplary introduction that gives a vivid and clear picture of the field.\"--,Classical Review,\"Laurent Pernot is known world wide among scholars of classical rhetoric, and this English translation of his survey should now make him widely recognized among English-speaking students as well...The book...is a pleasant and informative book that is clear and easy to read. It excels when presenting rhetoric in a social and philosophic context. Rhetoric grows within a community, and Pernot will always help the reader see rhetoric as part of a larger cultural whole...Pernot elegantly presents issues, giving a convincing sense of the unity and sweep of rhetoric in the classical world...Pernot successfully weaves together practice and theory, rhetoric and philosophy...This is an engag",

            "Originally Posted on:Confessions of an Opinionated Book GeekI was 100 pages into this book when I had to ask myself what I was reading and why. The synopsis calls this a thriller, but I never experienced any form of thrill or anxiety. I was creeped out at most, but not in the way that \u201cThe Ring\u201d creeped me out, but the way that stranger on the train who stares without blinking creeps me out. I just wanted to get away from the weirdness.And it is weird. There is a scene where a 17 or 18 year old boy gets in a bed and cuddles with his mommy while his girlfriend watches\u2026skeevy, right?! I just couldn\u2019t see past the weirdness. When it\u2019s not being weird, \u201cLast Academy\u201d is just a series of mundane boarding school scenes. It has this supernatural twist, but it doesn\u2019t have the charm of a book like \u201cAnna and the French Kiss\u201d which is about boarding school life, but is never mundane or boring.The synopsis basically gives away the big twist of this story, but there is a chance you totally missed it. If you missed it then this story makes absolutely no sense. I missed it, so after the first 100 pages of nothing happening I went back to the synopsis and was like \u201coh.\u201d Until you realize what it is that\u2019s happening you really have to wonder why the hell you should finish this book. When you realize what\u2019s really happening you have to wonder if this is the best the author could do with this idea.Camden spends a lot of time trying to investigate her school, the teachers and their financial backer.

Ivak\u2019s behaviour was distinctly child-like throughout the book. Gabrielle kept on bowing down to him and to his greatness, once her initial disliked passed. Like oh my, what big parts you have. Oh my, what nice winks you have, that he has already shared with hundreds of women before her. Oh my, what if I have another man\u2019s child inside me, would you still be mine. Umm\u2026 He has had several spawns running around himself. Or does it not matter because it\u2019s their great grand children who might still be alive in this century and that Ivak seems not to give any thought to them now, nor has he had before when all he was worried about was which woman next to impregnate.Then at the end, the man-whore himself accuses Gabrielle of being whorish. Pot calling the kettle black? Especially when Gabrielle was a good little heroine and had stayed celibate before she even met him, not requiring the incentive that Ivak had needed to stay celibate.ARC courtesy of Edelweiss and HarperCollins",

            "Book: Kiss of Temptation (Deadly Angels #3)Author: Sandra HillPublication Date: 3/26/2014Reviewed by: Tammy Payne- Book Nook Nuts My Rating: 5 Stars REVIEW *May contain spoilers *Ivak Sigurdsson is a Vangel . Ivak was punished - found guilty of the sin of lust. His choice was to become a Vangel and serve under the Arch Angel Michael removing the Lucipires, Satan\u2019s demon/vampires on earth or hell. Ivak choose Vangel. Ivak must now serve in a prison and protect it from Lucipires those evil demons that Lucifer has. While working their he meets Lawyer Gabrielle and she just turns him into mush. Gabrielle though has an air about her and Ivak is not sure yet what to make of it. He knows the rules given to him by Angel Michael and so far so good.Will Ivak break the rules? Or Will he make Gabrielle his? Will she want him when she learns more?True to form with this series, we get another brother with another punishment and he chose Angel but he has a naughty side too once it can come out and play. Loved this one. Second time reading this book as I first read it back in June of 2013. I borrowed this book from my local library.Sandra Hill",
            "DNF. Just couldn't. The first book in this series was great and I loved it but now I just don't care. Do I care if Leroy ever gets out of prison? Um, not really. I also could not care less what happens to Ivak and Gabrielle. There was absolutely no reason for me to care so I'm walking away from this book after 115 pages. 115 pages, I might add, that took me nearly a week to read. I can read a 400 page book in a day...just saying.",
            "Originally posted at: http://www.longandshortreviews.com/bo...What do you get when you mix a matchmaking Cajun ninety year old lady named Tante Lulu with a Viking vampire angel and a sex deprived lawyer? A very entertaining read and it\u2019s all found in Ms. Hill\u2019s latest masterpiece, Kiss of Temptation .With Ms. Hill\u2019s Cajun romances, Tante Lulu was always there as not only an effective stirrer of the plot using charming hijinks, but her character was always a guarantee that there\u2019d be laughter at the most unexpected times. Imagine my delighted shock when I found out that this author, with her knack of tickling the most stubborn funny bone, decided to toss in a little of that generational humor and a lavender \u2018longcar\u2019 towards a hapless Viking whose sin was lust.The author set up the story by first giving a reader insight as to the worst possible outcome of unbridled lust. There are consequences and Ivak learned it the hard way. And he\u2019s still learning. Although the hero tries to walk the straight and narrow, he has too much naughty humor and tactless quips to share that drive the warden of the prison nuts. He\u2019s wise to the world and yet all his experience hasn\u2019t taught him how to deal with real emotions, true feelings and the difference between love and lust. In this book, he figures it out. His journey is well worth reading.Gabrielle is a woman on the edge of despair. She\u2019s worked so hard to help her brother be released from prison. When I first met her in the story, I got the impression that she was starting to see enemies and liars in every corner, that everyone was a foe \u2013 which is the beginning of the end of hope. However, she made one last stab at trusting a person and that choice opened up whole new avenues and adventures. In fact, I think she not only ended up finding true love, but she found a family and a sense of belonging that totally filled the dark spaces in her heart that she didn\u2019t know she had. The things that Ms. Hill had her do to realize both being in love and being loved is what made this novel so fun to read. One of the more amazing things is the heroine finding out that who she viewed as a person being profoundly against her ended up being one of her most fervent supporters \u2013 in a quiet sort of way. It was that tying up of an emotional loose end that made me appreciate Ms. Hill\u2019s storytelling talent all over again. The author has the ability to throw something innocuous at a reader in the beginning without us ever knowing how large a role it would eventually play. Those are cool surprises.Jasper, the villain and sexual sadist, is back. Hugs to Ms. Hill for giving me just enough detail and descriptions to make me squirm in discomfort, but not enough gross stuff to make me want to walk away from the book. The villain is not a redeemable character and that belief is reinforced in each book of the series. He\u2019s vile, twisted and a major pain in the Vangels\u2019 very delicious tushes. His minions are disgusting and equally perverse but rest assured, once again, good triumphs over evil. Mostly.As much as I enjoyed and was entertained by the novel as a whole, there were a couple of parts that seemed rushed. There were some minor conflicts that came across as being too easily solved and Ivak\u2019s path seemed smoothed over by the lack of detail and closure. It was like a narrator came in to hurry the characters along so readers could get to the good stuff \u2013 the romance. I\u2019m not complaining because I really liked the \u2018good stuff\u2019, but, I did notice the change in storytelling. I can even understand the why of it because if the author delved too much into those scenes and let them lead her, I suppose the book would then have been more about the conflict itself than the romance between Ivak and Gabrielle. Another thing that struck me as \u2018off\u2019 was the guard. Ivak and his nose should have figured out long before what he was. Heck, even his brethren should have gotten a whiff. But none of them did. It allowed for a conflict to occur that I guess was integral to the story, but I don\u2019t believe for one minute that they couldn\u2019t have averted that particular situation. I think that was the only truly weak point in the whole book.Once again, St. Michael the Archangel is on stage and I loved how Ms. Hill had him be \u2026wrong. It reinforces the understanding that angels, even an Archangel, are messengers, helpers and interpreters of God. They are NOT God however because only He knows everything. Which means St. Michael got a shock of his own. Not only was it adorable but it provided another fascinating aspect of Vangel life. I have to wonder though, what\u2019s next?Secondary characters abound in this novel and they contribute flavor, ambiance, plot hilarity and surprises. All of them enhance the romance growing between Ivak and Gabrielle and it\u2019s all good.Don\u2019t resist reading a Kiss of Temptation because if you do, you\u2019ll be missing out on a fun adventure of romance and mayhem from the talented Ms. Hill. There is so much to like and enjoy that I could not cover it all in this review. I didn\u2019t even get to cover the naughty dream sequences! Check out for yourself why I believe books by this author are worth spending time with. Bet they\u2019ll make you smile.",

        "desc": "Young adult novelist Block (\"I Was a Teenage Fairy, \" 1998) moves into the adult market in a series of unusual tales tied together by lyrical sex.,Francesca Lia Block's edgy tales of the Los Angeles dreamscape that is 'Shangri-L.A.' have thrilled millions of readers and literary critics alike. The author of Weetzie Bat, Dangerous Angels, The Rose and the Beast, and several other best-selling books here brings her sensual, dream-like fantasies full circle with this erotic work for adult readers, NYMPH. ,As in her other works, Block weaves together themes of subtle magic, youthful hopes, modern urban decay, and deep emotion, told with lyrical storybook language.The stories in NYMPH bear all the hallmarks of classic Francesca Lia Block--punk spirited characters who celebrate love, life, and art-- with one important different: this time the author carries her vision through the full range of emotion and erotic interaction that her mature audience appreciates. ,An interconnected series of stories, NYMPH is a special journey through the lives and loves of characters like Plum, a Crayon-haired girl who has a gift: if she makes love with a person, that person will then meet their true love, or Tom, a burned out surfer whose luck changes when he is rescued by a mysterious, wheelchair-bound woman, or Sylvie, a chronically depressed poet who finds beauty in unexpected places. Block's erotic explorations of these smoky, kaleidoscopic fables are anything but conventional; these are stories of love, loss, and life, about the healing power of sex and bonding.",

            "This very rarely happens to me. I have read a Francesca Lia Block book that I did not like. I've read nearly all of her ENOURMOUS output and this is only the second book that I well and truly did not like. Let's hope that it stays that way.This is an erotic short story collection. Ms. Block normally writes for the YA market (but any adult could and often does read her work) and this was her highly trumpeted first major work for the grown-ups as it were. When it was published a lot of ink was written about Block finally not going to fade out during her sex scenes. Frankly I wish she had never written this book.Don't get me wrong, no one, NO ONE, writes emotion like she does. No one can make you feel their characters to the point where it can be dificult to figure out where they end and you begin like she does. And the first two stories, were amazing. Stunning. Classic F.L. Block at her best. After reading those two I was convinced that it was all going to be another wonderful reading experience for me.Then I read the rest of the book.This has got to be one of THE most depressing books that I've ever read in my life. Block has had a very public battle with depression and anorexia and she's written very honestly, and beautifully, about these issues. However, this entire thing, save for the first two stories, reads as though it was written during the depths of a depressive episode wherein she locked herself in her closet and wrote an interconnected short story collection. By the time I finished this book I felt heavy, sad, depressed and angry. All I wanted to do was sit and look out the window, and not in a good way.These are the least sexy and saddest erotic romance stories I've ever read in my life!Do not judge Francesca Lia Block's work on this book alone. If you do you will miss out on one of the best writers publishing today. Just... skip this book.There is one character, Plum, who took the cake as far as wanting to make the reader slit their own wrists. She has the love gift after she has sex with someone, they then leave her to find the person of their dreams. She gets so dissasociated with her own body and sex and ends up just seeing love and sex as gifts she gives to others, not something she fully recives herself.A few of the men she falls for end up realizing they are gay after having sex with her! A woman finds the perfect guy, person after person leaves her! I nearly ended up crying for her. And I hardly ever shed a tear when I read a book. Plum's saga was the most godawful depressing fictional thing I've ever read in my life. It was phenominaly written, but I NEVER want to read it again.Tale after tale of depressing, sacrificing sex. That's nearly the whole book. Wonderously written, but sad as hell to read.",
            "Francesca Lia Block always does some beautiful, magical things with language. But let me summarize every story for you: a person is broken and a special sexual encounter heals them. Also, the only gay sex act described is performed as a magic spell to get a heterosexual couple together.",
            "Overall, these erotic short stories were fine, but they were nothing special.",
            "Block provides a short story erotica collection utilizing her signature fantastical realism prose and interlocking short stories. Readers will enjoy the fast-pace (the stories are brief and the book itself is a shorter read), the descriptive language that nods to mythology, and the powerful emotion in each story. Block's writing style will not be for everyone, as there is a lot of blurring between reality and fantasy instead of straight-forward dialogue/plot. Tropes: mainly m/f short story romances with some LGBTQ+ characters/relationships, NOT a slow burn--totally not a slow burn, crude language and sex throughout, patient/doctor or patient/nurse romance, unrequited love, death of loved ones, sex/love through magic.Heat rating: NUCLEAR\u2014explicit sex, indelicate language during sex, and graphic depictions of a sexual nature used to further the story, may also include light kink, not quite enough for an EXPLICIT level (5), but takes it a level past HOT (3).*Note: I'm rereading all of the romances that I read/reviewed before I implemented the heat rating system. Read below for a blast from the past review--when the book was apparently mis-shelved in the library's YA section!***Block gives another set of short stories that intertwine to make a fabulous read. She keeps up with her past books in that she uses various myths to create points about her modern characters. The book is entertaining, but it's very much erotica and I wasn't expecting her to be so explicit. In comparison to some of her other books, which are also very sexy at times, this book is much more graphic. I can just hear the parents pushing for it to be removed from that shelves and placed in the adult section. It's nothing racier that anything that I read in fan fiction when I was the target age group, but I don't think a lot of adults would understand that. So for me, I loved that book but I think that the marketing is slightly problematic. It's definitely something that advanced readers can look at though, so I don't think that it should be removed, just that we should advise a little more.",
            "Nymph is a collection of intertwined short stories. It starts with a quote from Ovid's Metamorphosis, My intention is to tell of bodies changed to different forms. That quote is not only the underlying theme, but also hints at the mythical feeling infusing all of Francesca Lia Block's writings. The erotic and fantastic, the far-fetched, and the everyday with a twist are all combined. At the heart of the stories is a woman named Plum. She has the love gift, which benefits everyone but her. Shortly after having sex with her, each person finds the man or woman of his or her dreams.In Milagro, she has sex with her closest male friend, Santiago, and discovers a secret about him that she really knew all along. In Nymph, Plum has sex with her closest female friend, Sylvie, to ease her pain and loneliness. An aging surfer dude loses his edge in Mer, but regains it with a mythical lover. In Spirit, the spirits of lovers long dead enliven the nearly dead sex life of a married couple. A sexy nurse and a dying young man fuck like there's no tomorrow in Milk. A woman tries to escape from being the object of men's fantasies in Goddess. Change is about the opposite, a woman wishes that she could be all of the beautiful women in the world while having sex with her boyfriend. In Fox, a sex therapist has to deal with urgently pressing ethical issues. In the story bearing her own name, Plum meets the man who may be the one to end her gift.The stories are typical of Block. They're oozing with ultra swanky hipness and girlish dreaminess, yet are surprisingly and graphically sexual in content. The sinister atmosphere of Goddess, the pornographic sappiness of Milk, the surreal nostalgia of Mer, and the overlapping lives of the characters are all brought together with a smooth precision. I read Nymph all the way through, but the stories are also strongly independent of each other. Hopefully, Block will write more for adults in the future.",
            "Nymph is a book of erotic short stories, not a young adult book really. The stories are different than the usual erotic stories for two reasons: One, they are generally fantastical in some aspect, and two, they in very small ways interact with each other. The only thing I don't like about it is the fact that once in a while the coarse terminology for sexual acts and body parts cuts into the beauty of her poetic writing. I am not generally a fan of sex stories, but Ms. Block made them not only tolerable but enjoyable. Mer is the story of a man who has a sexual and loving relationship with a woman who is apparently a mermaid. Spirit is a story of a woman whose antidepressants cause sexual disinterest, to the dismay of her lover . . . and how they eventually resolve the problem with the help of a vacant, condemned house. Milk is about a nurse and her relationship with her patients. Milagro is about Plum, and what happens when she makes love to Santiago in order to let him find his true love. Nymph is about a girl (the best friend of Plum) named Sylvie, who feels like she will never find her true love, and what Plum does to help her do so. Goddess is about a club where the women are surgically changed to be exotic, and how Elvis finds his old lover in this place. Plum is about Plum again, and how she wants love for herself. Fox is about Elvis and his obsession with his girlfriend (before he found her again), and how Dr. Jacqui Fox helps him with fantasies. Change is about Carmelita and her jealousy, her writing, and herself.",
            "The first two stories, Mer and Spirit are beautifully written and legitimately great (and hot), but once a nurse goes down on a dying cancer patient it's all downhill from there. (Apparently Nurse Karen Milk likes to wear a white garter belt under her scrubs. Good to know.) I know these are based on fairy tales, but it just gets all improbably ridiculous, with blindingly white rich skinny girls mucking about LA and banging their BFFs named Plum and guys named... Elvis Dean. Okay. After a while it began to read like Grand Theft Auto V with Faery Sex Magick added. No thanks.",

The story follows a little monster preparing to throw a surprise party for on of his monster friends. The first frustrating part for me was there was really two narratives going on in this book. There was the text at the bottom of each page moving the story forward and then inside the illustrations is where the dialog took place. There were a lot of little one liners and jokes you would find on a Laffey Taffey wrapper but those really amused me.My main problem was trying to figure out how to read it, especially to a child. Do I start with the illustrations? If I start there the story wont make sense, but if I start with the narrative some of the narative from one point to the other might be lost because it used the dialog to push it together. This was my main complaint with the whole book.The illustrations are wonderful. they are fun and fresh but they also have that retro quality about them that could also make this book feel 20-30 years old.This would be a fun book to read to a child around their birthday or Halloween",

            "  More like 2.5 stars. I really was hoping for a nuanced examination of Facebook and in particular Mark Zuckerberg. Losse had the ability to write so much more. Perhaps she was restrained by contracts she had signed, but this book largely fails. She attempts to write a anthropological and sociological expos\u00e9 on Facebook, using her Johns Hopkins degree(which she never lets you forget she has) but as an English MA, she is ill-equipped to do a real analysis. Instead we get stories, with ill placed theories that disrupt the flow of her writing. And she uses many theories in the wrong context. Plus she wants you to feel bad for her that as a Customer Service Rep she only made $20 an hour. Booho. What Losse fails to recognize is that she is part of the imperialistic, white washed, upper middle class, well-educated, american apparel wearing, coachella attending, daft punk listening group of workers at Facebook. She was not an outsider. And now I suspect she is fairly well off after selling her facebook stocks before the IPO. "

            "Real rating: 3.5 starsWhat drew me to this book? Let's see...a recent English major grad joins the fledgling customer support team for a social network that just reached 5 million users? Sound familiar, Kara?Though I could relate to some of the customer support stories, that's pretty much where the similarities end. Losse depicts Facebook as a fairly blatant 24-year-old Old Boys Club, complete with graffiti of large-breasted women on the walls and a caste system based on technical knowledge. As one engineer described it in the book, everyone upstairs not on the tech floor is dumb. Ouch. She definitely wasn't afraid to draw attention to the Dark Side of Facebook. I wonder how true-to-life these descriptions are.In any case, the narrative does a fair job of charting the arc of her feelings about the enterprise over time. In the beginning of the story, there were definitely some yawn moments. Losse seemed to have drank the Kool Aid, to put it simply. Facebook is changing the world this way, it's also revolutionary in that way, etc etc. The story zigzags between casual narration of events and grandiose observations like it was an early moment of youthful alacrity in a company's inexorable rise to power. And such. I found myself pretty bored with the tired meditations on how technology distances us from our friends and family. Plebeian as I am, I wasn't interested in the (probably necessary) analysis or personal anecdotes. I wanted to hear the Juice. What is Mark Zuckerberg like? How are decisions made on how to change the product? And, being a dork, what were the various customer support issues and how were they handled?? I didn't get many answers, but I did find the end to be more interesting, especially as she got promoted in the company.All in all, definitely some insights, but not exactly what I was looking for.",
            "This is such an interesting read, a glimpse behind the scenes, so unexpected. I enjoyed it quite a lot.",
            "Today I joined in for #24hourbooclub's distributed reading experiment to read Katherine Losse's The Boy Kings. It was a fun day, and I always enjoy the shared reading experience and the excuse to power through because I know others are there with me doing it to. Here are some immediate quick thoughts, post-run contemplation.Reading Losse\u2019s opening introduction to her discovery of Facebook, I was immediately taken back to my Freshman dorm room and the Dell desktop on which I first read about and signed up for Facebook, in early February 2004. Her descriptions of the social groups that flourished and reflected real social structures on campus reminded me how useful Facebook once was\u2014it really did run parallel to my college social life (rather than an online/offline dualism). But it reiterated to me how little value Facebook, or rather, its active social network, now offers me.I was shocked by a few insider details from the early days, like customer support actually having access to complete profiles through a shared master password (it\u2019s not just machines collecting our data, it was legible to real, live humans popping in and out of our profiles when needed). And the fact that \u201cdark profiles\u201d existed for those who were pictured but not yet on Facebook was startling, but not exactly surprising.Losse does a great job taking The Boy Kings metaphor through the book, illustrating in their own language the terms of war, of power, of creation, of \u201cconquering\u201d and the \u201cbunker\u201d offices that justify the modern Napoleon comparisons. And Losse acknowledges that she herself was part of a certain colonialism, taking Facebook world wide as internationalization manager.The most telling piece for me was Losse\u2019s recollection of Zuckerberg\u2019s ideological manifesto blog post series that never came to fruition. The proposed topic list indicates the larger systemic ideological problem in the Valley:\u201cRevolutions and giving people the power to share, openness as a force in our generation, moving from countries to companies, everyone becoming developers and how we support that, net-native generation of companies, young people building companies, purpose-driven companies, starting Facebook as a small project and big theory.\u201dThese unaccounted for positions, ways that our technological leaders see the world go unexplained, unarticulated, and therefore often unquestioned. But they remain in the background. This scene is breaking point for Losse, where she falls out with Zuckerberg, and perhaps out of Facebook\u2019s spell. And she falls far enough to write this book. But not far enough to pick apart the problems inherent in these statements. It\u2019s not enough to just acknowledge these philosophical stances as problematic, hinting at how \u201ccountries to companies\u201d suggests a \u201cnouveau totalitarianism.\u201d She couldn\u2019t write in favor of them, building their case as Zuckerberg\u2019s ghost writer, but maybe she could have explored here at greater length what was so troubling to her about these stances. She kind of just told it like it was, as a personal account of an interaction, rather than a critique.And that\u2019s where Losse\u2019s weakness is made clear. She\u2019s a former English PhD, not a sociologist or an anthropologist, really. So she tells her story, and she observes from the inside, but she doesn\u2019t tell us what it means. And while leaves open subtle interpretations for a sympathetic audience, it prevents her message from reaching those it could most influence, like Zuckerberg himself.I read between the lines for hints of social theory material, and they are there, but they are subtle. And perhaps that\u2019s a strength of a mass market approach, making her argument more relatable skating over references to Baudrillard, but talking about power in the context of The Wire, rather than political philosophy. But it\u2019s not enough to just state that \u201cYou were like Peggy on Mad Men.\u201d She\u2019s a inside enough to hear Zuckerberg\u2019s philosophy, outside enough to know there\u2019s something fishy, but not outside enough to take it further.I found myself wondering about the line between humanist and feminist concerns in the Silicon Valley culture critique. Sure, there\u2019s misogyny to address in a corporate world run by brogrammers and in talking about systems that support \u201clooking for pictures of women,\u201d but it seems like Losse\u2019s issues were just as focused on the automation of human life, turning social problems into information problems: \u201cIn more ways than one, I was like the humanist troll to the company\u2019s obsession with technologizing everything.\u201d I wonder what is lost when feminist concerns and humanist concerns are conflated in silicon critiques. Paragraph added after sleeping on this. But perhaps it is not fair to demand more of Losse. Perhaps I ought to grant her more epistemological charity (as Sheila Jasanoff encourages). Her tale is a personal one, a memoir. And I do believe that personal narratives make the stakes of criticizing technological systems that are a part of our everyday lives that much more visceral, more human than an abstract, disembodied, academic critique. I think this book is doing something very important, critiquing the assumptions and ideologies of the technologist who are shaping our world from the inside out.I read the book on my iPad from 10 AM to roughly 3:30 PM on Sunday in a marathon reading for #24hourbookclub, eager to finish before the rest of my weekend plans took over. I tweeted a few key quotes, and checked in on the #24hourbookclub conversation between chapters.",
            "Oh, my. This was not a pleasurable read. Losse presents herself to the reader as a disinterested outsider, as if she went into this venture (journey into the heart of Facebook) with eyes wide open and almost as an undercover consumer advocate of some kind. Of course she was just young, out of work with an english graduate degree, and needed a job. The idea to write about her experiences apparently didn't occur to her until toward the end of her tenure in the boy empire.And of course the subject matter is dismaying, to say the least. Although Losse obviously drank the Kool-Aid for several years, she does present the more egregious behavior to us with an adequately critical eye, not letting the Mad Men-esque atmosphere go by without appropriate disparagement.I was mostly disappointed because I expected more from this book, and more from Losse. Her pseudo-analysis of what it all means could have been so much better, with her firsthand experience. It reads more like a one-day-we-did-this, then-we-did-this daily journal than an examination of the implications of our online behavior for wider society. It could have been so much better! Those higher-level connections just don't break through--there are occasional breaks in the cloudy thinking, but the sun never really shines through. Maybe when Losse is a little older?Still, there were sections I found interesting:I shared my concerns about the bluntness of News Feed...that it wasn't just telling me things quickly but telling me things I typically wouldn't know about...None of the stories were removed. I wondered, then, if News Feed and the future of Facebook would be built on the model of how social cohesion works--what is comfortable and relevant to you and what isn't--or if it would be indifferent to etiquette and sensitivity. It turned out to be the latter, and I'm not sure Mark knew the difference. To him and many of the engineers, it seemed, more data is always good, regardless of how you get it. Social graces--and privacy and psychological well-being, for that matter--are just obstacles in the way of having more information. (43)Losse presents herself as sticking up for the few ladies in the company, but then there are passages like this one:I led the boys past Agent Provocateur with a tinge of longing that told me that in my heart what I really wanted was a boyfriend who would take me to Vegas and buy me a lingerie set that I could wear because I would know he loved me, and it would be okay to be naked, vulnerable in front of him. (70)when the product team created an experimental feature called dark profiles in fall 2006, nobody even flinched. This product created hidden profiles for people who were not yet Facebook users but whose photographs had been tagged on the site. It reminds me now of the way members of the Mormon church convert dead people, following the logic that if they had known about Mormonism when they were alive, they would have been believers. Facebook was our religion and we believed everyone should be a member, even if they hadn't consented yet. (88)Why is this kind of immediate sharing of our most mundane moments with distant friends even a thing that is happening? The answer to this question, as with all the things that Facebook made over the years, was that the sharing was happening because it could. If it could be built, it must be, and we must be, if not the first, then the biggest builders of this and every other thing. This was the code of the valley. (113)When I first started working at Facebook, I wanted to believe that my experience there could have been a love story. That is, I thought, in some sense, that Facebook could be what we all--the employees, the users--sometimes wanted: A network through which we could connect and love each other more readily and more easily and with more permanence, a place in which we could feel more authentically ourselves... (139)Even in the office, where I would spend six or more hours a day, I felt more visible online than off. People were too busy reading their screens to talk to each other...Social media is about bringing us online and asking us to play with one another in digital space. Social media then is the ultimate Internet game, played according to the rules and metrics created by the boys who make the games and write their algorithms. (205)I like these security guys, I thought. It seemed healthy to be hanging out with people who had fought in real wars. (217)",
            "This is more like a 2.5 stars than a 3. Where The Social Network tells the story of Facebook through the detached lens of a legal proceeding, The Boy Kings tells the story of FB through the first-person career-climb narrative of FB employee, Kate Losse. I liked the inside story for what it was. I also liked the personal story of a young woman out of college making it in the big boys' world all the while making fun of the big boys for their inability to stop being big boys. But, the repetitious phrasing and images and the holier-than-thou tone ruined the overall effect of the book for me. I think Losse wanted this book - at least, in part - to be an expose of sorts, but I think she failed in that regard because what she was exposing - gender discrimination, money/power grabs, Napoleonic complexes - is nothing new in any text that discusses the American corporate world. In fact, the story was SO quintessentially American that if you had transplanted Disney for FB, not much would have been lost. The other part of Losse's agenda with this book seemed to be a confession, an admission of guilt or sin. Or, at least, that's what I hope she's doing, for her sake - it would slightly redeem her in my view. Though she often comes off as haughty (she definitely doth protest too much) regarding her disdain for the very thing she is a part of and is capitalizing off of, Losse speaks to a problem I see widely in our culture - particularly in my own personal world - of wanting to be in it and above it at the same time. I think this is a very real issue, I just wish her tone reflected this conflict more personally. I wanted to believe that she understood the paradox of her situation, but sometimes I genuinely couldn't tell if she even got the irony of what she was saying. Overall, to me, she felt like an unreliable narrator. I understand the magnitude that is Facebook. I get how drastically it's changed our relationships and the way that we interact with or even understand each other. More, it doesn't seem like a fad that's going away. But, there is still a REAL LIFE out there, and many people still engage in it. Losse makes it seem that we have abandoned the personal ship altogether, and maybe those like her, who are SO immersed in technology, have. But, most people know how to strike a balance, and she didn't acknowledge that at all. Her smarmy way of criticizing our hyper-digitized world - while also writing in digital language like LOL and &lt,3 throughout the book - made me, a person who often laments the downgrading of interpersonal, real-time, face to face connection, cringe even when I wanted to agree with her. She's too often stuck on the very high horse from which she so desperately wants to get down. Living in the bubble of Palo Alto limited Losse's capability to see anything outside of that techno-world. For example, she writes, Real life was something everyone in my News Feed the other people in Palo Alto seemed relieved to leave behind, if only for the immediate reason that real life can't be owned and graphed and, as such, can't make you famous and rich. IS SHE KIDDING??? Real life can't be owned? Can't make you rich? Does she live in America? Has she seen Here Comes Honey Boo Boo? Losse seems to think that the social network is the first invention that has manipulated people, changed people's behavior, made people self-conscious, made people wealthy for doing a whole lot of nothing really. While I get that they were doing two very different things, in the two tales of Facebook, I like the Sorkin/Fincher version much much better. ",
            "Sad. I look at FB as a fun, interesting way to stay in touch with friends. Katherine Losse's The Boy Kings unfolded a story about conquering at any cost. A Boys Club of Hackers and Elite Engineers from Ivy League Schools. Company before Country.........men in expensive suits waiting to invest money in the next big thing. The myth, that no one has access to our private information.....except for employees that work within the confines of FB.So her others (including the founder) took her to writing a book and dealing in Real Life, as a betrayal. So what! How much time do each of us really spend in front of the computer having real conversations with people we don't know. We get what we give, we get a life by what we give back. The book actually made me re-evaluate what I continue to weigh about Social Media against actual social life interaction. Actually at the end of the day, aren't we evaluated by the things we do...........does it really involve the internet?Just a thought.",
            "This is pretty fascinating stuff. I wish it'd been longer, more detailed, by which I mean MORE GOSSIP, but it's not really a tale-telling book. It's more of a meditation of her time at Facebook, how she thought and felt about it and how those thoughts and feelings changed as the company did. I mean, there are some good stories, but the focus is on her personal journey through a very strange place. Again, I wish it had been longer, but she gets a lot into 250-odd pages, and it's definitely worth reading. I'd like to pick it up again in a few months.",
            "Boring and pretentious. The only real conclusion I drew from it is that everyone who works for Facebook is an insufferable asshole, but I already suspected as much."

            "My daughter and I are adrift. Lost. Searching for the meaning of life in a post-Harry Potter world.We've attempted a few books after finishing Harry Potter and The Deathly Hallows, but nothing inspired even a spark of interest until a friend on here reviewed Little Witch, and I thought. . . okay, let's try that one. At least it's about a witch.So, we got the book, and I was thrilled that the story was about an actual witch, named Madam Snickasee, who lives with her daughter, Minx, in \u201cthe ugliest, most rickety house in town.\u201dI read through the first few pages, cackling whenever I read Madam Snickasee's part of the dialogue, but after she threw several objects at her daughter and shouted \u201cSissy!\u201d in her face, I started to get a stomachache.Madam Snickasee also denies her daughter food and screams that she's \u201cuseless\u201d and \u201cdisobedient\u201d and calls her \u201cstupid girl.\u201d Right around this point, my daughter contributed, \u201cThis is like having Bellatrix Lestrange for a mother.\u201dThere is a joyless, abject quality to this 1953 lower grades chapter book, similar in feel to another children's book written 9 years before this one, The Hundred Dresses by Eleanor Estes.The witch seems to represent an abusive single mother who is living in poverty without a partner or a community and the daughter lives a solitary life without friends or advocates and fears her mother's temper, her own starvation and neglect.The daughter, Minx, reminded me far too much of a girl I once knew whose father beat her so badly in front of us kids, right out on the front lawn of my friend's house, that he knocked the barrettes clear off of her head. The force of his blows made her fall to the ground with her ears ringing. I remember how helpless I felt in this moment, how I closed my eyes to the horror of this girl's abuse and wished her bastard of a father would collapse dead in that moment on the ground before us. I felt a similar feeling here, that the only way I'd be satisfied would be with the painful death of the witch.Justice is served here, thankfully, and the narrative is strong as well, but there was such a sad, hopeless feeling to the book, I felt like I needed to chew a handful of antacids to finish it.Life is so bleak for too many children on this planet. I sure as shit can't stand being reminded of it."

I'm sure that even when I read this in the 80s it must have seemed dated. Reading it now is plain astonishing to see how different it is from more modern beginning reader/middle grade offerings.4 stars for this one, mostly for nostalgia (even though I don't actually remember it), but also for making laugh out loud several times with its vintage dialogue.Awesome Female Character score: 5/5 -- Minx the little witch is one determined chickie!",

Last night when I added it to my shelf here on Goodreads, I read many peoples' comments about how much they loved it and lamented it was no longer in print. Upon learning that it was out of print, I was glad to have my copy. But when I looked for it, I couldn't find it! Instead of my purple Little Witch, I had some other purple witch book that I do not recall at all. I must have unintentionally given away the wrong book. I went to the thrift store today, like I tend to do on half price Mondays, but didn't expect to find it. I was very surprised and happy to find my purple Little Witch!

Story of a little girl witch who wants to be nice and have friends, but who has an evil witch mother who does everything she can to squelch her good side. I felt a lot of affection for the little witch and loved being on her side. It was great fun whenever she was able to outwit her mother! ",
            "This is the first book I ever read. I was slow and introverted. I would go to the school library and check out a lot of books, so that others would think that I read them overnight. I opened the book when I got home and started looking at the pictures the way I did all books, but then I realized that for the first time, I wanted to know what the pictures meant. I began to read it. It enveloped me in a world that paralleled my own. How often I had wanted to find out that I had been kidnapped, so many times I locked my self in the bathroom and prayed, bargained, pleaded, and even wiggled my nose like Tabitha in the hopes that my life would be transformed. That night my life was truly transformed for the first time. I learned that a good story could transport me into a different reality! I learned to make up stories in my head when I didn't have a book to read at that moment. Years later I found The Little Witch on amazon.com and bought it immediately. This story was a major stepping stone in my childhood. It now rests on a special shelf with a few other treasured books from that time in my life, along with my special hardbacks of the Harry Potter series. My oh my! What I would have given to go to Hogwarts!!!",
            "This was my absolute favorite children's book when I was a young child. I signed it out of the school library so many times that I filled up the library card a few times. A few years ago, I was working in the library in an elementary school (different town), and they had a stack of books that they were discarding, and lo and behold...there was the book! I asked if I could keep it and they said yes. I hope some day that my daughter may like to read it.",
            "3.75 starsThis was a really nice book where a girl, Minikin aka Minx, lives with a terrible witch as her \u201cdaughter\u201d but is more like a house servant. She knows no love except brief moments of happiness where she glimpses a beautiful woman in the bureau\u2019s mirror. Eventually, Minx decides she\u2019s lonely and wants to go to school with the other children to learn and maybe make friends. The adults range from holding a prejudice against her since she\u2019s a \u201cwitch\u2019s child\u201d to being friendly and wanting to help her. Minx is really unhappy and doesn\u2019t want to be a \u201cwitch\u2019s child\u201d and is determined to live a life she wants even if she doesn\u2019t know how to achieve it. The story telling isn\u2019t exactly perfect but it gets the job done. There were a couple situations that I found a bit clingy. A policeman intimidating a child was a bit weird to read about. The other was when Moonfire forces herself and Minx to move into Grandma\u2019s home like this blas\u00e9 request is supposed to be a personality trait. Think it would have been better if she said that she could only do magic in a house if she\u2019s welcomed into it, which is why she has to surprise Grandma that way. I chalk this up to the book being from a different time period. There are really nice illustrations throughout the book. It\u2019s nice seeing these black and white sketches as you don\u2019t see them much anymore. I liked this book for what it was and could see myself giving it to a child just discovering chapter books."

            "Interesting projects. I had a little trouble following the instructions and the illustrations didn\u2019t provide me with help I needed. Experienced beaders will truly enjoy the book.",
            "As the title says, this book is all about the projects. After a brief introduction by Diane Fitzgerald and a multi-page foreword (AKA lovefest) by Jean Campbell describing Ms. Fitzgerald's career and many talents, the book starts right in on the projects. There is no 'Basics' section, but tips and techniques are woven throughout the book.This book has a whopping 24 projects. At an MSRP of $27.95, that is about $1.04 per pattern. If you want to try a lot of different techniques, this is a good book to buy. Throughout the book, the author shows very clearly how to put the beads together into the larger units needs to make the project. In looking at these images, I am sure a clever quiltmaker could apply beads to a quilt project in the same manner and achieve a great, if flatter look. The book is also good for the quiltmaker who wants to know more about beads. This book has wonderful pictures of different beads used.I was hard pressed to pick a favorite project as I started to look through them. Many of the projects are necklaces in styles that I don't wear. I liked the Midnight Snowflakes (pg.75)necklace, but it wasn't a favorite. I also liked the Lacy Bracelet (pg.71). I was also quite partial to the may Basket project (pg.65), but can't imagine wearing them as a broach or as a pendant, so I didn't know what I would do with them. I did like their look and imagine having a Spring Tree (as opposed to a Christmas Tree) covered with these baskets. I was getting discouraged, but the end of the book (pg.100) is the Braided Garland Necklace. Though it is a little bit large, I love the spring feeling of it. Each project has a page with a variation so the reader can see what the project looks like in slightly different colors or using different beads.The end of the book has a gallery of projects, presumably by Ms. Fitzgerald. I really like the Tulip Necklace Pouch (pg.125). It reminds me of the beaded bag Hermione uses in the Deathly Hallows.Enjoy this inspirational book and thanks to Lark Books for sending it to me.",
            "Diane Fitzgerald is very well known in the beading community, she's been writing books and helping beaders learn new techniques for years.This collection of her favorite projects is a great resource for people who are just starting with bead weaving. The projects are dramatic, wearable and use a variety of stitches that are diagrammed well enough for a beginner to follow.Each of the projects has complete instructions. So instead of an introduction providing an overview of materials and techniques, it starts with an introduction to Diane Fitzgerald and her contributions to the beading community written by another notable luminary, Jean Campbell. Then it gets straight into the projects.Starting for absolute beginners is the One to Many Strand Necklace, which is an older project of Diane's that works just wonderfully with today's trend for statement necklaces. The many strands are dense and heavy with seed beads, and well balanced by graduated beads in the one strand part.Then the projects get more complicated, ropes worked around cord cores, peyote, netting, brick stitch and square stitch, hexagonal weaving and other stitches.My favorite projects in this book are:Apple Blossom Necklace- A netted tube worked over a core and accented with a bead embellished ribbon flowerButton Doll Ornament- this little button man reminds me of necklaces I strung for my daughter when she was little. A simple thread path to make something adorableYao Necklace- A very dramatic looking necklace made in motifs which are square stitchedShimmering Waves - Super easy peyote variation that makes a gorgeous necklaceOne of the things I like best about this book is the supplies for the necklaces are very easy to find. Very standard bead types make it a project book that's very accessible. A good bead store should have everything you need except for some supplies you might need to find at a craft or fabric store.Advanced beaders who want more of a challenge might be happier with Diane Fitzgerald's Shaped Beadwork or Maggie Meister's Classical Elegance.I received a complimentary copy of the book to review on my bead site- BellaOnline Beadwork. My reviews are always my honest opinion",
            "Diane Fitzgerald's Favorite Beading Projects has beautiful photos of her projects and easy to understand instructions for beginning to intermediate level beaders. I loved her button ornaments and found them easy to do with a group of pre-teens that were interested in beading with wire. The 'Shimmering Wave Necklace' looked much harder than it turned out to be when I made one and then played with variations of my own. I still have several other techniques I want to try in this book of beading projects that can be changed to make designs that are unique to each beader using the basic techniques.",
            "This lovely book showcases 24 projects, mostly for necklaces, but many bracelets too, and almost all showing more than one variation. Good how-to diagrams &amp, photos as well as word descriptions. Many are quite complex and depend on specialty beads, but there are some simpler designs too. There's also a gallery of 9 other, mostly fancier, pieces that don't have how-to's but are similar enough to give inspiration.I wish I had the time and patience to make some of these things. I certainly would wear most of them if I had them."

        "desc": "Why do some of us get sick with greater frequency than others?What makes us more susceptible to illness? Are we doomed to get sick when our coworkers and family members do?Is there a secret to staying healthy?Joel Fuhrman, M.D., a leading expert and board-certified medical specialist in prevention and reversing disease, offers a comprehensive guide to superior health.Based on the latest scientific research, Super Immunity shows us how we can become almost totally resistant to colds, influenza, and other infections.The evidence is overwhelming: we can supercharge our immune system to protect our bodies against disease\u2014everything from the common cold to cancer. Nutritional science has made phenomenal strides and discoveries in recent years, and when this new research is applied it enables us to seize control of our health like never before. Dr. Fuhrman explains this new science, providing everything you need to know to put this knowledge into action in your kitchen and in your life.What we eat has everything to do with our health, and, unfortunately, too many of us are living with a severely depleted immune function. Our dietary choices are making us sicker, shortening our lives, and costing us billions of dollars in doctor visits, hospital stays, and prescription medications. But Dr. Fuhrman doesn\u2019t believe more medical care is the answer. Rather, he explains the solution is to change the way we eat. The standard American diet is nutrient deficient. We are eating too many highly processed foods, foods with added sweeteners, and animal fats and protein. At the same time, we are not eating enough fruits, beans, seeds, and vegetables, which leaves us lacking in hundreds of the most important immune-building compounds. By changing our diets and combining foods that contain powerful immune-strengthening capabilities, we can prevent most common modern diseases.Combining the latest data from clinical tests, nutritional research, and results from thousands of patients, Dr. Fuhrman proves that super immunity exists and is well within reach for those who choose it. We all have the ability to live healthier, stronger, and longer than ever before. Isn\u2019t it time you dis-covered super immunity?",

            " I learned about this book on a Doctor Oz show. Dr. Fuhrman was a guest who presented strong evidence for a nutrient dense diet. I was instantly hooked as a number of people in my family have faced serious illness.Dr. Fuhrman makes a convincing case for the failure of modern medicine. Basically doctors treat us AFTER we've gotten sick. They should instead teach us how to live in a way that reduces the chance of illness.Dr. Fuhrman gives the reader all the essential information for staying well by following a diet high in fruits and vegetables.He prescribes what he calls GBOMBS in hefty amounts: Greens, Beans, Onions, Mushrooms, Berries and Seeds. The doctor includes his version of the food pyramid where nearly every food on it derives from plants. He says it's okay to eat roughly 150-200 calories per day that are not plant-based - for example, meat or dairy. More than that amount, though, can lead to compromised immunity.Yes, his diet is not for everyone. However, I made the simple change of adding 1 or 2 green smoothies to my daily diet. These consist of 2 cups of leafy greens, celery, carrots, berries, and nuts.I have been surprised at how much better I feel. Carb cravings are basically gone, and I have more energy.I recommend this book to others who are willing to experiment with their diet to improve their health.(less) ",
            "Man, this one started out so good! Then, 'round about page 85, he starts talking about animal products. He's a vegan. And clearly completely blind to anything but the studies that support his vegan agenda. Throughout the first few chapters he explains the difference between whole grains and processed grains as well as the difference between raw organic vegetable and cooked, conventionally grown vegetables.  Then he goes on to lump animal products into one big category, with no mention of the difference between conventionally produced, grain fed, feed lot cows meat vs. organically raised, grass fed, hormone free cows meat. These are two very different things! Same goes for the milk and cheese. Same goes for fish.I am sorry, but the preponderance of science simply doesn't support the vegan agenda.  "

            "Dr. Fuhrman is brilliant. I have altered my diet after reading Eat to Live, 3 and 1/2 months ago and have lost over 25lbs painlessly. Severe dust mite and pollen allergies nearly history. My doctor had no solution for me but to wrap everything in plastic, get hepa filters and take antihistamines for the rest of my life. Joint pain and constant fatigue - gone. Getting sick constantly for long stretches - gone. This is all based on science and even if it wasn't, I feel better than I have in 20 years, so I don't care. This book is a little too technical in the first part but that's over soon and the rest is very easy to get your head around.Very, very important information for those of us who want to live long and wellRead Eat to Live first if you need to loose heaps of weight, otherwise this book is for everyone else who wants to feel insanely healthy and live to see their great grand kids. Also, watch the fabulous documentary Forks Over Knives and you will be sure that plant-based is the healthiest possible option. It's a real eye-opener.",
            "This is the only book you will ever need to read to understand healthy diet and its benefits. There are very good examples, which speak for themselves and don\u2019t need any more convincing for this healthy diet to boost your immunity and give your body healthy ammunition to fight any bacteria. Our diet should be mostly composed of organic plants, veggies, fruits, grains, and nuts. Meet is not needed, to give us strength - we can get it for example from avocado. We can still (as book suggest rarely) have milk or dairy products, or eat fish and sea food. ",
            "\u201cSuper Immunity\u201d is a book reading which one is forced to raise her eyebrows in admiration, astonishment and apprehension \u2013 all in equal measure. Dr. Joel Fuhrman, a well renowned nutritionist and bestselling author, in his thought provoking work, argues as to why and how a combination of Greens, Beans, Onions, Mushrooms, Berries and Seeds (\u201cGBOMBS\u201d) not only bestow Super Immunity, but also ward off diseases from niggling infections to deadly cancers. Dr. Furhman also treads into contested and controversial territory by advocating for keeping vaccines at bay and non-consumption of folic acid during pregnancy. Lest I be accused of getting ahead of myself, let me first begin setting out the theme that forms the cornerstone of Dr. Fuhrman\u2019s book.GBOMBSDr. Fuhrman exhorts us to make Greens, Beans, Onions, Mushrooms, Berries and Seeds an indispensable part of our everyday diet. Banking on empirical research, he states, \u201ca review of more than 206 epidemiological studies shows that the consumption of green vegetables has the most consistent and powerful association with the reduction of cancer of all types, including stomach, pancreas, colon and breast.\u201d Among the greens, Dr. Fuhrman places high emphasis on Cruciferous vegetables. Some of the vegetables coming under this category and getting a distinguished mention in Dr. Fuhrman\u2019s work are:Arugula,Bok Choi,Broccoli,Brussels sprout,Cabbage,Kale, andCauliflowerDr. Fuhrman urges us to blend, chop and chew these vegetables with a view to freeing Sulphur compounds from the cell walls and thereby boosting immunity and keeping colon, stomach and other cancers at bay.Waxing eloquent on the power of mushrooms, Dr. Fuhrman informs his readers that mushrooms are a repository of \u201clectins\u201d, proteins that bind only to abnormal cells, before destroying such cells thereby making dangerous replications an impossibility. Again, banking on empirical research, he says, \u201cin one recent study, women who ate at least 10 grams of mushrooms a day (equivalent to one small mushroom) had a 64 percent decrease in breast cancer.\u201dDr. Fuhrman also waxes eloquent on the allium family of vegetables consisting of onions, garlic, leeks, shallots, chives and scallions. According to him, these add more than just flavour to one\u2019s diet. They add anticancer, anti-inflammatory, and anti-oxidant compounds. Again research comes to the rescue. \u201cOnion intake scrutinized in a case-control multi country study, the highest consumers of onions had less than half as many cancers compared to people who rarely consumed onions.\u201dA database of ResearchDr. Fuhrman does not pull evidence and statistics out of thin air or try to pull rabbits out of a magic hat. He derives his findings as a result of painstaking statistics from various credible and reputed sources. One prominent go to source for Dr. Fuhrman seems to be the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (CDSR), a leading journal and database for systematic reviews in health care. CDSR includes Cochrane Reviews (systematic reviews) and protocols for Cochrane Reviews as well as editorials and supplements.Patient TestimonyDr. Fuhrman\u2019s book is interspersed with glowing testimonies from various patients who seemingly have come back from the brink of perdition to a life of miraculous recovery and contentment. These list of ailments from the clutch of which these patients have been liberated from includes autoimmune disorders of the likes of lupus and infections such as influenza etc.RecipesThe last sixty pages of Dr. Fuhrman\u2019s book is devoted to a plethora of recipes using the various ingredients that are extolled throughout the book. Categorised into Breakfast recipes, Smoothies, Blended Salads and Other Drinks, Salads and Salad Dressings, Dips, Snacks and Condiments, Soups, Main Dishes, Pita/Wrap Stuffers, Desserts, and Recipes with Nonvegan Options, these recipes obtain a special mention from Dr. Fuhrman in so far as their nutritional virtues are concerned.Fuhrman\u2019s Food PyramidThe entire book can be encapsulated in an interesting food pyramid where unlike in a conventional pyramid the foods of importance are placed along the base, while the ones to be avoided at all costs are positioned at the apex. The idea behind this unconventional thinking, as expressed by Dr. Fuhrman being, \u201cinstead of considering adding protective fruits, vegetables, beans, seeds, and nuts to our disease causing diet, we must make these foods the main focus of the diet itself.\u201dImage result for dr. fuhrman's food pyramid\u201cSuper Immunity\u201d is not with its fair share of controversial proclamations. Dr. Fuhrman rails against the administration of commonly used medication for the treatment of cold and flu. Targeted for their supposed lack of efficacy are cough suppressants such as Dextromethorphan and Codeine, antihistamines and decongestants, medications such as Ibuprofen (Motrin and Advil) and Aspirin, and Acetaminophen (Tylenol). Even traditional remedies such as Chicken soup, Steam inhalation, increased intake of fluids, Nasal Saline Irrigation and Vitamin C are not spared.If this sounds a tad bit radical, be prepared for what comes next. Going against the grain of popular convention and received wisdom, Dr. Fuhrman astonishingly rallied against the use of folic acid by pregnant women. \u201cGetting enough folate from natural foods can keep cancers from starting, by repairing errors in DNA, but folic acid appears to feed tumor development and promote carcinogenesis. In light of this research, I do not include folic acid in my multivitamin or prenatal vitamin. I do not recommend that pregnant women take a prenatal that contains folic acid.\u201dWhile pressing hard for the liberal use of cruciferous vegetables and seeds in abundance is one thing, a sensational call for abdicating flu vaccines and abhorring antibiotics even when one\u2019s sputum is greenish yellow in colour is a totally different thing altogether. Such discomfiting philosophy, to me personally at least, seems akin to throwing the baby out along with the bath water.\u201cSuper Immunity\u201d, on the whole is a thought provoking book that while providing most answers, throws up an equal number of questions as well. But one thing is clear. In a world swamped by processed edibles, junk foods, carbonated drinks and unhealthy eating, Dr. Fuhrman\u2019s book plays a key role in both acting as a wake-up call and pointing the right way forward in setting this dangerous imbalance right."

Her salvation arrives in an unlikely form: Bridget O'Connell, an Irish maid working for a wealthy Boston family. The catch?

            "This story had such great potential, with 3 separate stories being woven together. One of those stories comes from a tall, skinny yet beautiful 13 year old girl whose mother is nearly non-existent, her father is busy finding someone else to love and her best friend has become one of her cyber bullies. Another part of the story is an older lady who has 'lost' her only child, and then the third comes from a very old book found in a basement. I was intrigued, because I love that concept of finding old diaries. I did like the story, but I feel a little let down. I don't need to have every aspect resolved in the end---I like a good story that makes you wonder a bit--but it felt like the author decided, 'i don't know how i want this to end, so i will just leave it at that'. The characters seemed to get thinner and thinner as the ending approached and then the story line just dissolved into nothing. I was left wondering 'why didn't this character do this' and 'whatever happened to so and so?' It was frustrating and a bit disappointing. I appreciated Ms. Moore's writing style and feel she has talent, but I think she could have done better with the ending.",
            "Hm. So I won an advanced readers copy of this book for the purposes of reviewing, I imagine.I got about a page in and already knew-- the characters would be irritating. More on that another time. The two mains are dealing with harsh realities: one has a junkie daughter God-knows-where and the other has recently divorced parents-- dad's got a new girlfriend and mom doesn't even get dressed these days. The way the author approaches the mindsets of each just seems rather... shallow.Also, the author has a problem with telling rather than showing, which I find irksome and exhausting.I've written pages of notes for as far as I made it into the book before I abandoned it. Perhaps I'll add a few more points from them later.",
            "Ehhh, this one just didn't do it for me. I had a difficult time getting over many of my pet peeves such as the recurrence of a word throughout a sentence or paragraph, poorly-formed sentence structure that made me halt and re-listen to figure out what was really being said, and character cluelessness. These things often get in the way of my ability to enjoy a story and this time was no exception.I found Kathleen to be a loathsome character, though I'm not sure that was the intent. I was shocked over and over again at how self-involved she was but how busybody-ish she seemed to be. So controlling yet so unaware of what was really happening in her environment. I felt jaw-clenchy every time her character started speaking. I was particularly bothered by her lack of awareness. She would mention her dog, Lucy, and how Lucy was normally one way but was acting another way. After a few chapters of these notifications, the reader knows the dog is ill and needs to go to the vet. How come Kathleen takes so long to figure that out? If she's so into her dog, as she says, she probably should have noticed her dog's ailment much sooner. I also didn't like how Kathleen had to be so involved in everyone's lives but never to their benefit, it was like she was always trying to redeem herself, to prove that she could make everything right for everyone else without ever knowing what was wrong. Ugh. I couldn't stand her.I didn't like Bridget, either, though she was more believable, I've known plenty of girls like her...the ones who have that sense of entitlement and feel something is owed them. However, it was nice to see Bridget at least grew up eventually and took responsibility for her youthful actions, realizing that she'd been a nasty little creature once upon a time.Natalie was the only character for whom I had any sympathy. While she didn't really feel like a 14-year-old, I could still understand why she did what she did, why she felt what she felt, and why she was the way she was. She wasn't a strong character, by any means. There are a lot of gaps for the reader to fill in and maybe I used that to Natalie's advantage, maybe that's why I could have sympathy for her, I gave her attributes that weren't really there because I could.Here's the part that really bothered me, though: bullying. I know bullying is a hot topic both in the media and in real life right now. I'm torn on the issue, probably because I've been both the bully and the bullied. I felt my personal issue with bullying was showcased in this very story - why aren't kids able to cope with the teasing and malice that leads up to full-on bullying? Where are their tools? How come no one has shown them how to battle bullying, especially cyber-bullying? Where are the parents and teachers and concerned citizens? And just what is bullying, anyway? I didn't feel text messages claiming to know the truth about Natalie's mom should qualify as bullying.I think there's a line between teasing, malicious or otherwise, and full-on bullying. I thought Natalie was definitely being picked-on at the beginning but it seemed the type of girlish nastiness that could have easily been squelched, the type of crap we all have to endure at some point in school and then again in real life, over and over. It shouldn't have escalated to bullying but it did. Once it was recognized, no one did anything to stop it except for our good friend and heroine, the archivist Kathleen. And she's pretty much inept so it did no good. Is this how it really works? It starts with petty little jabs, nasty comments, rude behavior and then escalates into hate speech and death threats because no one knows what to do to make it stop?I was left thinking that if this story is supposed to highlight the evils of bullying, it's doing a poor job. If it's supposed to be showing the importance of belonging, it's still doing a poor job. I was left unimpressed."

            "The main and most central theme of this book is bullying and its ramifications. Anyone who is considering reading this should know this right up front.For some reason or another, I thought this book was going to be about this neato mysterious old diary, and watching the characters as they discover the history and story behind the diary. While this did happen, to some extent, it was definitely more of a side note. The main theme is bullying. Why do I say bullying is the central theme? The lady who wrote the diary, Bridget, an Irish immigrant, was bullied as a teen by her female employer, who at one point resorts to physical violence. Kathleen\u2019s daughter was subjected to bulling from friends and eventually gave in to peer pressure and became a drug addict. Natalie, the person this story revolves around is being bullied constantly, you will find out what happens to her if you read it. There are dual narrators in this book, some chapters are told from Kathleen\u2019s voice, and some are told from Natalie\u2019s. Kathleen is an older lady who works at the State Archives. She is a little bit psychotic because she lost her daughter to drug abuse caused by peer pressure. She is constantly trying to fill the void. She sees a bit of her daughter in Natalie and so has latched on to Natalie like human crazy glue. (I am punny) Despite of (or maybe because of?) Kathleen\u2019s neurosis, I found her endearing. If not for Kathleen I don\u2019t know that I would have liked this book much. Natalie, our other main character, is being bullied via text message and online by her former best friend and another girl. While I understand the real threat that faces teens with cyber bullying, I was just plain angry and Natalie for 90% of this book. When I wasn\u2019t mad at her I was mad at her parents. Yes, Natalie is young and therefore should get a little bit more leeway with doing unintelligent things than your average character. But, I found her to be weak and stupid. The plot is steady, and I can see how a certain audience would be captivated enough to read it all in one sitting, but at times the plot was a bit too disjointed for my taste. The whole reading of the diary thing felt kind of odd to me. I don\u2019t really know how to explain what I mean. The characters were reading the diary with each other or sometimes by themselves, so it would jump from modern day story to the next part of the diary story. But it was like there was too much preamble leading up to the diary story between the readings. I liked the diary story, and I liked the fact that the characters were reading it, I just didn\u2019t like the way it was actualized. All in all it was a decent book and I don\u2019t regret reading it. It is always fun to check out a new author that has a style of writing that is different than what I am used to. If you want to read a rather depressing book that drives home the fact that girls can be cruel and bullying can lead to drug abuse, violence, and poor self image then this is the book for you. If you are already pretty clear on these facts, you could probably skip it. I would also like to say that if you are a teacher or otherwise work with teenage girls, you may gain some insight from this book, however, I personally found the majority of the bulling to be too extreme and unrealistic.  liked itI am giving this book 3 stars because of the character development. As well as the historical aspect of the diary. Thank you to goodreads and Hachette Book Group for the free copy of this book and the opportunity to read it. I received this book for free from goodreads first reads program, but that in no way influenced this review. ",
            "Mini-Summary: A lonely archivist, Kathleen Lynch, emotionally scarred by the loss of her own husband and daughter, befriends a teenage girl, Natalie Gallagher, who is struggling with the divorce of her parents and cyberbullying from girls at school. This unlikely pair comes together through mutual interest in a mysterious diary written in the 1920s by an Irish nanny, Bridget Callaghan, who has secret struggles of her own.Some Thoughts (Spoiler-ish, fair warning):I won this ARC in a First Reads giveaway by GoodReads, and I thought, having won it, that it wasn\u2019t going to be\u2026 well\u2026 good. I never actively read anything that isn\u2019t a classic, popular, or mainstream. I read books that are pretty much guaranteed to be at least well-written. So, I thought I was going to have to fake some nice things to say about this one, and that it would be a total disappointment because I acquired it so freely and easily. Despite all of my doubts, I am happy to say that this novel is actually pretty good, even if it isn\u2019t entirely for me.The real potency of this novel comes from the Natalie Gallagher storyline. Moore very aptly captures the plight of the teenage girl. Natalie struggles with the suddenness of her parents\u2019 divorce and all of the change it brings into her life. Her disappointment in her father\u2019s new romance and mother\u2019s crippling depression is palpable. She is surly and impatient with them. Natalie looks to her parents as sources of strength, and she is deeply angry at them for being fallible and coming up short in their responsibilities to her. Natalie desires someone solid and aware in her life, and she learns the hard lesson that all children must eventually face: parents are humans too, and the childhood memories we have of them being superhereos are figments of our imagination.The cyberbullying thread of the story is incredibly true to life. Natalie gets bullied by her ex-best friend and another girl, jealous of the attention Natalie receives from one of the boys in their grade. Moore expertly depicts the cruelty and calculating nature of insecure teenage girls through the constant bombardment of texts, voicemails, pictures, and website posts that Natalie suffers through. Natalie feels betrayed, helpless, and lost. She loses all self-confidence and becomes very angry at the world. This book practically screams at the reader, sending a strong message about the harsh realities of cyberbullying.There are some flaws within this book, however. For one thing, Moore does a poor job with Bridget\u2019s voice. I just could not hear the Irish immigrant nanny. I could not hear the Roaring Twenties. Sure, the characters had bobbed hair and Bridget called the lady of the house \u201cma\u2019am\u201d every now and then, but that\u2019s where any believability stops. I think maybe if Bridget didn\u2019t use speech patterns that are so obviously present day, or if she had an Irish lilt to her voice, I might have been able to buy her character. I commend Moore for trying, and it\u2019s an interesting concept to tie the characters together through these dated diary entries, but Moore should stick to what she is good at, and it isn\u2019t historical fiction.The character of Kathleen Lynch is another really off-putting component of this book for me. I simply could not stand her. She is a sniveling, pathetic wimp of a character. The constant repetition within her inner monologue of \u201cGirls in trouble. Girls needing help. Trouble everywhere! We need to help ALL TEh GIRLZ!\u201d is so incredibly annoying. There were some points in time where I wanted to throw the book at the wall. Kathleen is so self-absorbed for most of the book that she couldn\u2019t see that her dog is dying and that her friends needed her. Her fixation on her lost daughter, Susannah, drove me crazy. I do concede that that may have been the point, Kathleen was drowning in her own losses. However, I think I would have still been able to see Kathleen\u2019s redemption in the end without all the psychotic echoing of \u201cGirls in trouble!\u201dand the endless pity-parties she quite literally threw for herself (so many pointless pages of her hanging out in her apartment alone, thinking of the lost Susannah, who cares?!).But I digress. Overall, this book passed the time pleasantly. There are some issues that I couldn\u2019t ignore while reading it, but it packs a strong punch about adolescent bullying. I suppose I could recommend this book to teen girls (though I\u2019m not sure they will have the patience for the middle-aged bouts of regret and loneliness Kathleen goes through), but I think I would really recommend this book to mothers of teen daughters. It\u2019s mostly a cautionary tale with a little bit of secret love affair and gratuitous gay best friend thrown into the mix.See an extended review at my literary blog here: http://rkgutmann.blogspot.com/2012/05... ",
            "When I first started reading this book I thought that though it was well written that nothing very much was happening, but this is one of those books that slowly but surely draws you in and keeps you there. The characters were wonderful, they became the people who live down the street from you, they were so very human in their failing, their problems and their lives. They tackle real crises, the same ones we all have to face every day, the challenges we try so hard to overcome and it was these characters that make this book so special. A young girl being cyber bullied by her ex best friend, a young gay man waiting to adopt a child and an archivist whose own daughter ran away when she was seventeen and has not been heard of again. These people find answers from friendship and caring and from a journal found of a young woman's troubles in the 1800's. A quiet novel but for me a brilliant one. ",
            "The lives of three women, a teen deeply affected by modern-day cyber-bullying, an early twentieth century Irish immigrant servant girl, and a middle aged archivist, are spun together in a story that transcends time. Moore\u2019s ability to craft a meaningful and poignant story, while developing characters that seem to speak directly to the reader on so many levels, is astounding. I have not been so transfixed by a book in a long, long time. Upon finishing So Far Away I immediately special ordered a copy of her previous novel, The Arrivals! Set in both modern day and early twentieth century Newburyport, Massachusetts, as well as modern day Boston, the three characters\u2019 lives intersect and interweave in ways that are both exciting and emotionally moving. These are three women I actually LIKED and could relate to, which is rare. Even the teenaged character, Natalie, is able to speak to the reader in ways that make her both believable as a teen, with emotions, thoughts, and responses that actually seem to emanate from a young woman. This is such an amazing talent for a writer to have. It is striking how she is able to speak in all three voices authentically and give honor to each.But enough talk of what a great writer Meg Mitchell Moore is\u2026this is a just a great novel! Natalie, 13, uncovers a dusty notebook in her basement and undertakes the task of attempting to discover who the mysterious writer of the crumbling journal was and why it was in her cellar! She must do this while coping with her parents\u2019 divorce, her mom\u2019s debilitating depression, and constant cyber-bullying from her peers. Natalie seeks out the help of a stranger, Kathleen Lynch, a fifty-something year old historian, working in the Massachusetts\u2019Archives, to help her turn the journal into a meaningful school project. The third character, Bridget, plays out through the journal itself. Written almost a century before, the notebook details her life as a new immigrant from Ireland who has come to Massachuestts to be in service to a wealthy North Shore family. Great writing and a well thought out story----read it!!!",
            "Oh, how the blurb for this book deceived me. I thought it would be flip flopping back and forth in time telling 2 different stories. And, while you do have a subplot involving the diary of a woman from the 1800's, it is only the impetus to move the present day story along.I found this book highly depressing. And the storyline involving cyberbullying was incredibly anxiety provoking, in my opinion. It felt to me like so many other contemporary women's fiction where the characters are floating through life in a fog-like state, unable to deal with the hand life has dealt them.While the main characters' storylines resolve, to a degree, I found the ending to be unsatisfactory and left many loose ends. I read novels to escape not to play out exactly as real life would and, for that reason, I am unable to recommend this book. However, if realism is what you're looking for, it is definitely a well-written (if unsatisfying to this reader) novel. ",
            "Listened to fifty percent before setting aside. Story didn\u2019t grab me. Was bothered by the bullying. Felt no connection to the characters. Best to part ways with this one as I was dreading listening to it. "

One day, the cat takes a nap and the three little mice discover three jars of paint and climb right in. Now one mouse is red, one is blue, and one is yellow (the three primary colors).

Now each mouse has created a \u201cnew\u201d color (secondary color) orange, green, and purple.

In this installment we have an ancient artifact that may be a key to one of the gates of hell, a murder and a case that can be linked back to Brianna\u2019s mother Leah. This suspenseful novel was delightful and I loved re-visiting all the unique and colorful characters.Brianna Winston-Beaufort has recently opened two law firms in Savannah, Georgia. She inherited the practices from her Uncle Frank. The first office is located in a beautiful old office building on Bay Street. She has hired a spunky secretary who works part-time while obtaining her GED. She plans to go to college to become a Para-legal. Here Brianna deals with temporal cases or cases involving living clients. Brianna\u2019s second office is located in a house on Angelus Street. This office is surrounded by a cemetery. Here Brianna\u2019s staff consists of angels. This is her celestial office and she deals with souls who believe they have been wrongly condemned to hell. A lot of times the two cases are connected. Since opening her doors, Brianna and her staff have solved four murders for her temporal office and reduced or eliminated the sentences for four souls. All of this occurs because she and her staff are forced to act as detectives to solve the celestial cases. Because of the nature of her work, she has been provided a lot of heavenly help. She has a loving dog named Sasha who can communicate and warn her. Vicious guard dogs, her staff and an Arch Angel who appears when she is in grave danger. In this novel, Brianna\u2019s Aunt Cissy wants her to represent her fiance in a lawsuit regarding a magazine. This case is anything but simple, when the fiance is murdered with Aunt Cissy\u2019s kitchen knife. Then an old artifact surfaces with a soul condemned to spend eternity in hell. Brianna has been burning the wick at both ends, and these two cases may be more then she can handle. The tale that unfolds is interesting with twists and turns.The characters in Stanton\u2019s novel are delightfully southern and each unique. I always enjoy their interactions. Brianna\u2019s family would give me a headache with their meddling ways, but they love Brianna. Stanton does a wonderful job of describing Savannah and the buildings there. The celestial court, Brianna's role and the cases are all fascinating and Stanton's attention to detail is appreciated.",
            "Angel CondemnedBy: Mary StantonCopyright November 2011Publisher Berkeley Prime CrimeReluctantly agreeing to defend museum curator Prosper White, her Aunt Cissy\u2019s fianc\u00e9 in a case of fraud, Bree hopes to settle the matter out of court. When Prosper is murdered on the steps of the Frazier Museum, Bree discovers that Aunt Cissy is the only one who found her fianc\u00e9 engaging. Cissy is arrested for the crime, and to clear her aunt\u2019s name, Bree must solve the mystery of the Cross of Justinian, an artifact of great interest to the multiple suspects who wanted Prosper dead. The Cross is also a crucial piece of evidence in Bree\u2019s newest celestial case, a case that threatens her mortal family as well as her very existence. Bree is definitely NOT a happy camper. Her Aunt\u2019s Fianc\u00e9 (who is not liked by anyone in the family) is being sued and she is forced into defending him. She finds herself also being contacted by a new celestial case which turns out to be connected to her mundane case and the hole she\u2019s fallen into just keeps getting deeper and deeper. While her celestial office staff and do their stuff, unless it directly affects the well being of Bree they can\u2019t get involved in the mundane. Guess what? Bree\u2019s complete compliment of staff, plus walk ons will be coming across your pages. Bree is going to be stretching herself to the limit in this case. In fact this one case is going to be more trouble than all her other cases to date rolled into one. It\u2019s another roller coaster ride and a thoroughly enjoyable one at that. I totally expect everyone to find this a great read, and a wonderful investment of your reading time.FTC Full Disclosure: I borrowed this book from the Brooklyn Public Library System for the purposes of writing this review.

        "desc": "The French architect Le Corbusier once described New York as \"a magnificent catastrophe.\" Since its emergence in the mid-nineteenth century as the nation's \"metropolis\"' New York has faced the most challenging housing problems of any American city, but it has also led the nation in innovation and reform. The horrors of the tenement were perfected in New York at the same time that the very rich were building palaces along Fifth Avenue; yet public housing for the poor also originated in New York, as did government subsidies for middle-class housing. \"A History of Housing in New York City\" traces New York's housing development from 1850 to the present in text and profuse illustrations. Richard Plunz explores the housing of all classes, with comparative discussion of the development of types ranging from the single-family house to the high-rise apartment tower. His analysis is placed within the context of the broader political and cultural development of New York, a city which in many ways summarizes in microcosm the evolution of urban housing in the United States.,Plunz examines the multiple tensions among builders, government planners, housing reformers, and architects which have affected the course of housing development. He explains how the first high-rise apartments were built for the wealthy who preferred the security of living \"above it all,\" and he looks at the technology which made them possible. The author examines the effect of the urban economy on development. He describes how the rising cost of Manhattan real estate and the growth of transportation networks have contributed to the departure of the middle class from the inner city, leaving it with little except luxury housing and slums. He offers fresh material on the creation of \"garden apartments\" which proliferated throughout the outer boroughs and remain among the finest models of urban housing. Plunz also offers insight into how and why modernist \"tower in the park\" designs of architects such as Le Corbusier and Walter Gropius were adapted into the design of much of New York's public housing, and the recent return to low-rise publicly subsidized housing, such as new \"suburban cottages\" set amidst the abandoned buildings and rubble strewn lots of the South Bronx. More than 300 illustrations are integrated throughout the text, depicting housing plans, neighborhood changes, and city architecture over the last 130 years. \"A History of Housing In New York City\" is a pioneering study of a largely unexplored realm of United States urban development, as well researched as it is well written.",

            "The ability of the author to make an enjoyable read out of what is a potentially forbiddingly opaque subject is incredible\u2014I dunno how he did it. The writing style didn\u2019t seem to *deliberately* seek to avoid coming off as dry, yet it wasn\u2019t. In any age, this book shoulder required reading for anyone in New York\u2026 and beyond. But especially those of us living in New York, some perspective is gained\u2014for instance, the fact that early problems in equitable housing were often attributed to \u201cabsentee landlordism,\u201d a term which today wouldn\u2019t even register since the phenomena of having your landlord actually live in your building is incredibly rare, was just, well, a sign of the times, eh?While early beginnings from Dutch colonization are passed through, the details really come out when Plunz gets to the imposition of the grid. The New York gridiron was not just lacking imagination, it was also \u201creversed from the ideal\u201d in terms of solar orientation, with south facades receiving all of the sun and north facades receiving none at all. This, in addition to their being no service alleys, made the New York gridiron uniquely substandard. That said, it was profitable for landowners. Plunz writes,\u201cEven if the city had doubly reimbursed owners, permanent removal of the land from the market would have reduced profits for an infinite future. The original gridiron was designed to maximize profits. Land speculation was big business. The rights of its practitioners were not easily infringed upon.\u201dIn these early days maximum land coverable of buildings meant maximum profits. Old Law rules did a bit to fight this tide, but if a building was built with lesser coverage than other projects, it was probably the result of some sort of philanthropic effort. The result was overcrowding, disease.. and shanty towns. The New Law was an attempt to balance real estate interests, the architectural profession, and the building bureaucracy. The New law era, with its elimination of the 25 foot lot development (the efficient lot size for New Law was, for complex reasons, 40 x 100 feet), opened up the space for large capital development. The fact that projects were now typically larger scale also opened up a space for the architect.Because land become so expensive in Manhattan, this large development was more appropriate for the outer boroughs. Yet, development was not equal across boroughs. For instance, in The Bronx, a smaller outer borough land-wise which saw much early development, there grew a city of apartments. The New Law developments of The Bronx then saw large, perimeter block style apartments which became especially common in the 1920s. In Queens, much larger and later in development, single family homes were more common. Brooklyn was somewhere in-between. In all cases, open land and reduced values permitted reduced site coverages.For all these reasons we begin to see a turn in philanthropic housing which focuses on building and design quality instead of land value. The 1920s was the era of the middle-income private unit and the co-operative house (a la Amalgamated Dwellings). Tax exemptions for construction in the 20s as well as subsidies for private development also served to catalyze such projects, which were usually realized in the \u201cgarden apartment.\u201dNew technologies and building materials further increased \u201ccreativity\u201d in land coverage, making possible \u201cZielenbau\u201d type development associated with the functionalist \u201cinternational style\u201d that came to define 20th century architecture\u2014the \u201cslab block\u201d and \u201ctower in the park\u201d were not far behind. Plunz writes,\u201cIn the twilight of the prepenicillin age, the ideal hygienic its had at last emerged, with the old urbanism of insalubrity replaced by a perfect elixir for urban ills, real and imaginaned. \u2026 For the first time, social housing was definitively linked to low cost of construction. Previously, the issue of cost had been limited to providing affordable housing through philanthropy, rather than economy. \u2026 the slab block was consistently conceived as a breakthrough in the realm of cost. Nothing could be cheaper, and therefore more housing could be built with limited resources. It was an elusive dream, inextricably tied to the emerging morality of the modern welfare state.\u201dAn era, defined!It has been said many times that the early NYCHA houses were informed so much more by a sense of dignity than the later developments. Plunz reflections above epitomize the runaway ideology which informed the brutalities of Slum Clearance and its attendant projects. Gone are the days of the social vision of the 1920s driven by the garden apartment which, as advised by Frederick Ackerman, dissenting voice in social housing, still maintained a distinction between housing and the factory. Even commercial spaces, a feature of early public housing, was quickly removed from the sites.It is important to remember, however, that *much more* money was given towards realizing single-family home ownership. Woefully inefficient, yet serving an American ideal, subsidies were provided to fuel a consumerist economy, much to the pleasure of giants such as General Electric who wished to hock their wares in the form of household appliances.The midcentury left us with two ideals in social housing within the City itself. One was the NYCHA campuses, which served to contain its inhabitants, masses of people which formed an economic and racial ghetto\u2014and of course there was the middle class ideal, the fortress that protected its inhabitants from the assault of the unwashed. It really was a tale of two cities.From here, we know the story, The Jacobsean backlash, the insistence on construction and housing which does not disturb the neighborhood. \u201cNehemiah\u201d and Charlotte Street style apartments which at once spoke to a homeowners ideal while remaining silent on any sort of aesthetic vision. The slow death of funding for public housing as well as the failures of the Bloomberg and DeBlasio administrations to tackle the housing crisis through public-private partnership scenarios are covered. All this in a landscape of increasing wealth inequality. The issue of \u201cpatronage\u201d for social housing remains a yawning question. The early 20th century found private initiative to be inadequate\u2014a lesson I think we could take stock of today.Plunz ends on a hopeful note, that the ideals of the \u201cownership society\u201d have lately come into question and New York seems the most ideal answer, saying \u201chistory seems to be in the side of New York.\u201d But he also ends this incredible history reminding us that \u201cWhat is even clearer today than three decades ago is that there will be no \u2018uninformed and naive\u2019 social catastrophes as far as housing in New York is concerned. How the future plays out, however, remains a large question, as indeed the game is quickly changing.\u201dI myself am encouraged by much of the work done lately on housing\u2014the new rent laws which have landlords in a panic are surely a step in the right direction, and the greatest movement towards making the challenge to the ownership society a sustainable one. But New York has always had the best and the worst of the United States. Monstrosities in construction (both aesthetically and in terms of social responsibility) continue to go up. The proposed two bridges towers are a perfect example of this. Yet, plenty of good people are working towards a better future. And with Plunz, I agree, that future is likely to lie in New York\u2014what that future looks like remains to be seen.",

            "Absolutely beautifully rendered illustrated edition of this wonderful fairy tale.Reading the Foreword, I learned that it is possible that Pushkin's inspiration for this story came from Washington Irving's Tales of the Alhambra.

            "Oh my! I was thinking this would be a delightful addition of Russian literature to my children's collection. I already have some Baba Yaga retellings, a Bilibin-illustrated Tale of Tsar Saltan, and Gerrady Spirin's gorgeous Firebird, so it's only fitting to add more of Russia's most celebrated poet, Alexander Pushkin. I loved studying Pushkin's poetry in college, alongside Anna Akhmatova and Marina Tsvetaeva, and I was expecting some of the same wistful, romantic caliber here.*SPOILER AHEAD*Maybe I'm too soft-hearted, but this is DEFINITELY not a children's book. It is true to what fairy tales USED to be - bloody, graphic cautionary yarns meant to terrify children into decorum and thinking twice. If you're not squeamish and you want your children to keep promises, this is one surefire way to instill that in them. Legit. The guy who goes back on his word gets his head sliced open by a bird...and that's a wrap. No falling action, no explanation, just straight up beak-to-skull. Also, the female characters were very spoiled and coquettish, with no positive substance. I know that's probably because Pushkin's own wife was very flighty and shallow (and was fooling around with the tsar, as it details quite explicitly in the introduction of the edition I rented). But I definitely bristled, and I've got pretty thick skin, so I feel safe in saying the portrayal is offensive. Not sure if this is a translation issue or if the original story is just this gruesome and depressing, but I'm going to pass on buying that hard copy now. Yikes.",
            "Illustrations by Dulac brilliantly beautiful. Story makes no sense, at least to a modern American perspective. Ends abruptly, with an epilogue that questions the nature of dreams and speculates on their relevance to this story. Does it have a plot? Not so much. Characters that illustrate human nature? Kinda sorta maybe. A theme or moral? Maybe, if the reader works to drag out one to her liking. I look forward to seeing if other reviewers have any wisdom for me.",

            "Arguably, the study of church history and the impact various events and individuals had on the formation of the faith as we know it today is an often overly neglected part of the average believer\u2019s focus of study. While many certainly adhere to certain theological positions, they often fail to consider where those positions derived from, who championed them in the beginning, and how they helped to shape theology in general, let alone how certain positions impacted politics and countries at large. The Baker History of the Church series was developed to help address this lack of study concerning church history and the second volume in this series by Dr. Ivor Davidson called A Public Faith: From Constantine to the Medieval World (A.D. 312-600), is an excellent contribution to this series and the study of church history.Beginning with the Emperor Constantine\u2019s \u201cpublic patronage of Christianity\u201d beginning in 312, Davidson traces the development and expansion of the church to include a number of key individuals during this period such as Augustine as well as some of the key church councils that took place during the period of time this volume gives it focus. Additionally, false teachers such as Arius are examined to include the details of his heretical position and why the church held the famous Council of Nicaea to deal with the issue of Arius and his teaching. Davidson aptly discusses the result of the Council of Nicaea to include the Creed of Nicaea and the Canons of Nicaea as well as their overall impact on Christian teaching and beliefs from that point forward. Davidson clearly notes the continued issue of Arianism and the necessity by the church to seemingly constantly deal with that teaching and its various offshoots. Theological discussions such as that of the incarnation and such theological terms as homoousios and how that relates to the incarnation of Christ were important points of the faith during this period and Davidson does a great job of engaging such topics.The spread of the church into Asia Minor is also a point of emphasis for Davidson in this volume. While Constantine had a policy of promoting Christianity, Julian took the tact of promoting religious tolerance going so far as to repair places of pagan worship. As with the debate over Arianism, many other issues of great theological importance took place in the East to include the discussion over the status of the Holy Spirit which led to works by individuals such as Basil and his treatise called On the Holy Spirit written around 374-375. Furthermore, discussion took place concerning the Trinity with the so-called Cappadocian Fathers contributing much thought and writing to such issues. Davidson also addresses the Council of Constantinople with its condemnation of a number of heresies of the period.Other movements such as Asceticism and the monastic movement come under the apt scrutiny of Davidson as he clearly notes the impact of the ascetic movement during this time to include the development of monasteries throughout the Middle East and in the West. Church Fathers such as John Chrysostom are focused on by Davidson and rightly so given the impact he had in particular with the issue of Origen. The great Augustine of Hippo to include his life, teachings, and times receives a lengthy treatment by Davidson which is no surprise given the enormous influence Augustine has had on theological and church history. Augustine involved himself with a number of discussions concerning issues such as Donatism, Pelagianism, sin, grace, the human condition, all of which are discussed by Davidson in great detail. Davidson also spends time looking at Augustine\u2019s classic work The City of God, noting the \u201cexpansive critique of Roman religion and philosophy\u201d contained in its pages.The formative period of church history discussed by Davidson in this book also includes a number of key theological issues such as monophysitism and a number of offshoot teachings that came to be from that perspective. Davidson does a great job of covering the debate that raged over the nature of Christ and the seemingly constant division that occurred between those who held various theological positions on these issues. Furthermore, the development of positions on practices such as baptism, the liturgy, the Eucharist, consecration, prayer, hymns, music, church structure, and a number of other key ecclesiastical stances are important elements of this time period and Davidson covers them all in great detail noting along the way how this time period continues to impact how many view such church and theological related issues even in our time.The rapid expansion of the Church following the time of Constantine up until the time of the Medieval World is a pivotal and important age of the Church and must be understood. Ivor Davidson provides for the serious student of church history a great resource by which to understand and engage this timeframe, noting the various issues that took place, how various heresies were addressed, the continued impact of those heresies, the development of ecclesiastical doctrine, and the numerous key figures both within and outside the church who carried great influence during this time. I highly encourage anyone interested in church history to give this book a read as in doing so, you will be understand this important period of the history of the church. I look forward to engaging the remaining volumes in this series."

I found it uneven, too wordy, and almost... ugly. I dislike this style of illustration tremendously. I didn't get a sense of magic from the book, instead, I just felt slightly put off by the strangeness of the narrator. Funnily enough, the little girl wasn't allowed to sit in a particular seat because it was reserved for Rosa Parks! Eh. It fills a gap in the market, but I feel like it could've been much more.

            "Aubrey YagerBook ReviewIf a Bus Could Talk: The Story of Rosa ParksFaith Ringgold1. Introduction:What would you do if a bus with eyes, nose and a yellow cap arrived at your bus stop? Would you hop in and enjoy the ride? Marcie does just that in Faith Ringgold\u2019s fictional book If a Bus Could Talk: The Story of Rosa Parks. This adventure story will be the ride of Marcie\u2019s life, because she hears the inspirational story of Rosa Parks straight from the bus. The story goes into great detail regarding Rosa Park\u2019s childhood, marriage and the bus ride that forever changed the course of history. The book is perfect for kindergartners all the way to 5th grade. It\u2019s an easy and interesting read. 2. Brief summary:In this book a bus comes to life and takes a girl named Marcie on an adventure she will never forget. Marcie discovers who Rosa Parks is and why she is known as the mother of the Civil Rights movement. At the end of the story, the bus takes Marcie to a birthday party where she is introduced to several important people from history. 3. Evaluation:This story did an amazing job at meeting its fictional goals. The book is a fantasy in the aspect that a bus couldn\u2019t ever talk, but it still told a real story about Rosa Parks. When studying the Civil Rights Movement in an elementary school, it is crucial for the students to be actively engaged in the story as well as emotionally aware of what the story is teaching. I was impressed by all the information provided about Rosa Park\u2019s life before the bus incident. By using Marcie, the readers can relate because it is someone their age. They can put themselves in Marcie\u2019s shoes and experience the bus ride themselves. The students probably aren\u2019t too familiar about Rosa Parks, or the bus story, just like Marcie. The readers and Marcie learn together and this is an engaging way to have kids participate in learning. I would suggest that the ending was different. I love that fact that Marcie was able to meet Rosa Parks and other important people from our history, but I believe it should be more focused on Rosa Parks to eliminate possible confusion. All in all, I loved the bright illustrations and the bus creates an adventure that no one could forget. 4. Conclusion:This book is great for elementary aged students, because it encourages them to make a difference. If one can anyone can, all you have to do is try. ",

At the end of Marcie's magical ride, she meets Rosa Parks herself at a birthday party with several distinguished guests. Wait until she tells her class about this!Genre: biography, historical, fantasyReading Level: This book is for fluent readers because of the small font and the presence of paragraphs on each page. There are specialized content words, complex sentences with a variety of words and spellings, and many multi-syllable words such as: Tuskeegee, neighboring, and dignity. Topic: standing up for what you believe in, bravery, a historical figure (Rosa Parks), civil rights movementCurriculum Uses: I would use this book as a read aloud to support a lesson about the civil rights movement and when I was discussing Rosa Park\u2019s contribution to society during that time. This would also be a great book to keep as a reference in my library or as an independent reading book.Literary Elements: This author uses personification in the book by having the bus talk and she also has the conflicts of man vs. man, and man vs. society present throughout the book. There is also inciting force, rising action, crisis, and climax in Rosa Park\u2019s story.Social Issues: oppression, racism, equal rights, segregation, civil rights movement, women's rightsIllustrations and Text: The illustrations in this text are visually appealing and capture the reactions of characters in the story very well. The illustrator does a fantastic job at bringing characters to life and depicting the absurdity of some of the situations that Rosa found herself in. Overall, the illustrations support the text enough that the reader can use them as a helpful reference in reading.",

            "Did I enjoy reading this book? No. Not a single second of it was fun, exhilarating, entertaining, or joyous. Did I pass my certification test? Yes, first attempt. That result was fun, exhilarating, entertaining, and joyous.",
            "Content was great and helped me pass the AANP FNP exam, but the errors in this book were atrocious (that\u2019s where it loses 2 stars). There are entire web pages dedicated to tracking the errors in this book. It\u2019s like no one even read it over a single time to edit it. I read the chapters fully until chapter 9 and then after that only read the exam tips in each chapter which I found helpful for the exam. The app access that comes with this book is nice to track progress on practice questions. They need to do a way better job editing the next version of this book - I would have been even more annoyed if I had purchased this book, but luckily a friend loaned it to me. ",
            "Good book overall, worth purchasing for the questions. I read about 50% of the content, but used all of the review questions. First the positive, the review questions are very good with thorough and clear rationales. Typeface is nice. Unfortunately the book contained a number of formatting errors where headings were unintentionally made sub-points of other content. This was confusing at first, but I soon realized that you couldn't trust the hierarchy of content, and therefore, some information was misplaced. The errors were irritating enough that I eventually stopped reading.",
            "Concise review of concepts for AANP FNP. Contains 720 questions, similar difficulty level as exam. Utilized this and the Hollier prep course for main study materials. Some errors found throughout book, hence 3 stars. ",
            "Great review book! Tons of practice questions!",
            "This book is the bible for nurse practitioners!!! I definitely recommend getting this book and start reading it during adult/gerontology, pediatrics, women's health, and definitely primary care and family practice rotations!!! This book should be used as a resource during practicum or clinical rotations and MUST BE used when studying for boards!!!",
            "Works by giving you a test and then reviewing the material in the answer section. Coverage of review material not as indepth...but overall a good study/practice book."

            "I don't have any earth-shattering insights to share from this most recent of god-knows-how-many readings, but this time through I was struck by: 1) what a damn fine piece of stagecraft this is, from the suspenseful, moody opening on the castle battlements to the solemn dead march carrying the prince offstage, and 2) how Shakespeare seems to want Hamlet's personality--particularly the wellspring of his actions (and lack of action)--to remain an enigma, and that he achieves this by infusing the character with so much of himself--so much wit and poetry, so much despondency and savagery--that the result is that the audience simply bows before the great mystery of human personality, and that this reverence for the unknown lurking in the heart of an extraordinary man intensifies the sense of pity, horror and waste that fills us at the end of the play.",

            "Updated review February 2017:This is my third time reading Hamlet and, like a fine wine... you know the rest. I read the same copy I've had lying around for years with one page of notes on the left and the play on the right. This time I was able to read most of the play without notes which was pretty awesome. Just had to glance over to figure out what some of the words meant, but I actually got the story this time. It's taken me three tries with a book that helps me cheat, but boy oh boy I finally got this down. It's beautiful! I loved it! It really hits a variety of genres and kept me turning the pages. It was weird... I read it pretty slowly to breathe in the language and take my time with it, even reading it out loud at times until my wife made me shut up. I tried to get her to play the female parts, but she wasn't feeling it. I guess she really just had the Queen of Ophelia so her options were limited. But yeah, I read it slowly but it also seemed to fly by at the same time. Hamlet is a very complex guy who goes through a range of emotions as the story unfolds. His monologues are just really great poetry that I wish I could memorize and just belt out randomly on a street corner or while I'm in the grocery store contemplating another unhealthy snack. To be or not to be... I loved the monologues. I loved when things just went nuts at times. The ending was just crazy and awesome. It's just a daggum fantastic story, and you should give it a shot if you haven't already. Find a copy that helps you and breaks down the language and all that. It's good. I've got Macbeth on the shelf, too. Might be time to revisit it and then tackle more Shakespeare. I've gotta be in the right mindset though. Can't just be reading all this nonsense all the time. I have real books waiting to be read, too. Books with real words and stuff. Previous review:I once asked a friend of mine if he liked Shakespeare to which he responded, I don't dislike Shakespeare. That's exactly how I feel about him, too.In high school I was forced to read Romeo and Juliet and Julius Caesar. My thoughts on Shakespeare haven't really changed much in the past 15 years. His stories are great, but they were written so long ago that it's not always fun to read. I appreciate the hell out of the guy, but he will never be my first choice (or second or third) when I'm looking for something new to read.That being said, this was my favorite play to read through. Maybe I'm older now and find it easier and more enjoyable to read this stuff for pleasure rather than because I may have a pop quiz over the third act. I thought the story was fantastic and was surprised by how many lines I recognized from just being a human and dabbling in a little bit of culture every now and then. Would I have ever read this if it wasn't being read in a group to prepare for Infinite Jest? Nope. But, I did and I'm glad I took the time to do it."

            "Well, as a Nora Roberts fan, this is going to be really painful to write\u2026When I found out that the new work of one of my favorite authors of all time was a trilogy placed in the magic green mountains of of Erin (Ireland), I was sooo excited! My favorite trilogy by Nora is \u201cGallaghers of Ardmore\u201d where I first met the amazing Ireland setting, and those who know Nora\u2019s work can tell that she have a talent for portraying scenarios. Obviously I was anxious to get my hands on \u201cDark Witch\u201d. But the Nora let me down\u2026again. Lately I\u2019ve been quite disappointed by Robert\u2019s novels. Indeed i loved the setting, I\u2019ve an obsession for Ireland that can\u2019t be cured. I love that country to bits and I don\u2019t think any modern author can fully describe Ireland\u2019s geography, culture and people like Nora Roberts. The magical environment created by the author is tangible and genuine. However, the fantasy plot was deeply tiring, with no dynamic and fairly repetitive.About the heroine, Iona, I don\u2019t believe the author gives enough information on Iona\u2019s past and background. We, the readers, know close to nothing about the protagonist history, family, past relationships. Nada. I'm not even sure of how old she is. Iona is an onedimensional character as well as the love interest Boyle, the horse breeder. The relationship between Iona and Boyle (the Main Characters) was well-knit but the romance lack chemistry. I was waiting for a \u201cdestiny\u201d love story, starcrossed lovers\u2026and the author delivered a run of the mill romance. Guess I\u2019ll have to wait for Brenna and Fin\u2019s story, both support characters have more depth and intense moments than Iona/Boyle. I was definitely frustrated by the romance in this book and it was a big issue to me, \u2018cause when It comes to Nora Roberts I have the highest standards. I miss the spark Nora\u2019s older novels used to have. I miss the powerful, intense books of Nora\u2019s early carreer. At this point, I can\u2019t help to think: What happened? Is she writing \u201ctoo much\u201d? Maybe Nora should take a long vacation. And I say this with love and respect, because I\u2019ve been reading her novels since I was a rebel teenager.I still believe in you, Nora! Hoping that the second book in the trilogy exceeds the first one.",
            "This book was a mess, in my opinion. The writing was sloppy, there was barely any plot, and the characters were all flat.Iona, the female lead, literally says anything and everything she thinks! She has no inner thoughts, no personality of her own. She seems to exist solely to provide exposition and is not very good at that either. The male lead is... who knows? He has no characters traits other than he seems to be the silent brooding type, but even that is never really shown or understood. He has no backstory, no history or character. Frankly, no one else in this book does either.There is barely any plot or pacing to the book. I don't know why they're fighting, who really they are fighting against, or anything else. There is no build up at all. There is no real explanation of anything at all. It felt like the author assumes we have read all her previous witch based books and therefore we know what this struggle is about. At times, I found myself imputing motives and emotions from her other books that were similar just to fill in the gaps.All in all, a real disappointment as a read. There was no chemistry between the leads, no real climax to the story, and no caring on my part whether they lived or died! It made me sad, and not in any way that the author intended :( ",
            "The first book of the cousins O'Dwyer series, Dark Witch, reminded me a lot of two other firsts of her trilogies- the Gallaghers of Ardmore, and the Three Sisters Island. If you've read both, you know they both involve outsiders coming into a life already in progress for the others, but quickly being accepted into the fold. In the Gallaghers, it's Jude going to Ireland to reevaluate herself. And in the Three Sisters Island, it's Nell fleeing an abusive husband, and unlocking her witch powers.In Dark Witch, we met Iona Sheehan, who goes to Ireland to meet cousins and basically get away from her parents and her old, unfilling life, at the urgency of her grandmother. She grew up knowing she had powers, but was never able to fully explore them because of her mother's indifference and almost fear of them.We meet her cousins, Branna and Conner, who open her up to her powers. We meet Boyle, who gives her a place to work at his stables, and who captures her heart pretty much immediately. And we meet Finn, who we discover has a history with not only the Dark Witch mythos, but with Branna. They had a past relationship that is still causing them heartache today.The Dark Witch myth is pretty intriguing- an ancestor of Iona, Branna, and Connor was the Dark Witch, and she is being attacked by Cabhan, an evil male witch who is obsessed with the Dark Witch and wants her powers (and her body). This entire portion goes on for 40 pages, but that's not a bad thing- it was pretty interesting, and I'm hoping she touches on the history of Cabhan and the Dark Witch a little more in the next books.Iona learns how to harness and control her magick through working with Branna, and she grows both in her job and relationship. I really loved hearing about her relationship with her horse, and the other's relationships with their animals as well. I really love when a story has that element. Her relationship with Boyle, on the other hand, was a little lacking. I don't know if it was just that Boyle is a harder male character than I've read from Nora in awhile, or if there was little to no chemistry- I just wasn't happy when they finally got together. And I didn't care when they had their typical Nora Robert's fight to break up. It was the typical Nora formula that I love, but I wasn't all that into the characters or their relationship. What I really enjoyed about the book, and why I still gave it four stars on Good Reads, is the relationships between all the characters in general, and the history behind them. And I want to know more about the Dark Witch, and I want to see Cabhan defeated. I'm invested. The second book in the Cousins O'Dwyer Trilogy, Shadow Spell, is set to release on May 6th, 2014 (as of this blog post). It looks like it is going to be Connor's story, and I'm so glad- I was hoping she would save Branna for last!(Review also on my blog - http://www.beautyandthereads.com/2013...)",
            "3.5 StarsThere\u2019s just something about reading a magic themed story by Nora Roberts that always makes me want to dance naked under a full moon chanting \u2018as we will, so mote it be.\u2019 I just can\u2019t help myself. If I\u2019ve learned anything in my years reading Nora, it\u2019s that I tend to enjoy her fantasy/PNR themed stories more than their contemporary counterparts, and my experience was no different here. However, if I\u2019m comparing this series starter against other witch-y tales by the queen of romance, then I would have to say this one fell slightly short. I think this mostly has to do with the romantic pairing in this particular story, as I found both Iona and Boyle a tad lacking in character depth and general likeability. The good news is I warmed to the secondary characters a great deal, including their animals. I also adored the Irish setting and I enjoyed the overall premise of the story at large, which kept me engaged and intrigued enough to want more.Ultimately, this was not my favourite Nora book (by far) but it was still a solid start to another magical trilogy.",
            "4 stars. Great world-building, weak romance, but still worth the read. I hesitate to describe this book as a 'romance' novel simply because the book spent little time actually exploring the romance between Iona and Boyle. Sure, there IS a romance in this novel. Sprinkled throughout the book are a few scenes where Iona and Boyle meet, chat, wink at each, flirt some more, sleep together, have a misunderstanding, make up, and then profess their undying love. Very formulaic stuff, and all woven around the more important parts of this book. The meat of this book is far more focused on the story of the Dark witch and her magically-gifted descendants living in Ireland. Despite being weak on the romance, I really enjoyed it. I think the book is probably better for it, because the romance itself was pretty lackluster stuff.I absolutely plan to stick with this series as I enjoyed the world building, loved the Ireland setting, and was intrigued by all of the secondary characters. However, If you read Nora Roberts strictly for the romance scenes, this one might disappoint. But if you enjoy a solid background story with some dark magic and prophesies, you might enjoy it as much as I did. I listened to this one on audio, and felt the narration was excellent. ",
            "The set upIona Sheehan risks everything when she quits her job, sells everything she owns and moves from Baltimore, Maryland to County Mayo, Ireland, her ancestral homeland. She seeks out her cousins, Branna, a Dark Witch, and Connor O'Dwyer, who her grandmother has told her so much about, determined to find that connection she's craved all her life. Iona gets more than she ever hoped for when her cousins embrace her and help her get a job with their friend Boyle McGrath, doing what she loves...caring for and riding horses. The issuesThe story begins with the medieval tale of Sorcha, the first Dark Witch, who took on Cabhan, an evil sorcerer. She passed her powers to her three children who in turn have done the same with their descendants. With Iona's arrival, the circle is now complete and the cousins must now contend with what evil remains from Cabhan. Iona is a novice and needs to hone her skills before they have to face his challenge. And, she's distracted by her developing romance with the gruff but sexy Boyle. What worked for meI absolutely loved that this story takes place in Ireland, complete with the vernacular in the dialogue between the characters. The men in this story are highly appealing...Boyle, with his tough and serious but sexy manner....Connor, who is lighthearted and generous, and Fin, who's dark with emerald eyes focused only on Branna, the most skilled of the witches who makes the paranormal aspect of the story exciting. Iona was delightful, though others may disagree. I found her sunny disposition uplifting in light of her dismal upbringing. Her joy was infectious, inspired her cousins and threw the serious Boyle completely off balance. While their romance edged up against that old insta-lovestoryline, it was knocked back into reality in an almost heartbreaking way. It made it much more interesting and emotional. What some have saidThere are comparisons to Nora's Key and Three Sisters Island trilogies but it felt fresh to me. I didn't see those connections and have read both. Maybe the setting made this story a standout for me as I didn't want to put the book down. The bottom lineI loved the Celtic lore, the witchcraft, the romance, the setting and the characters. I liked Iona and Boyle, primarily because of her enthusiasm as I connected with her circumstances. The book set the stage for the next stories in this trilogy and I'm anxiously anticipating them. If you've never read anything by Nora, this would be a great series to start. It's also pretty interesting for those of us that already have many of her stories already read on our shelves. I think it's a winner. 4.5 stars"

            "This picture book about Florence Mills was written by Ren\u00e9e Watson and illustrated by Christian Robinson. Mills was a stage performer who started as a child singing on her mother's knee.I admit this book was my introduction to this performer. Even though she performed in the 1920's there are no recordings or films, of her. There are many stories in print about her performances and of her life in general. She was the first African-American to have a full portrait in Vanity Fair, in 1925.As a child, she loved to perform and word spread about her performances and she was soon sought by theaters in Washington, D.C., the city of her birth. The family later moved to New York and she appeared in vaudeville acts with her sisters (the Mills Sisters). In 1921, she appeared in Shuffle Along a jazz musical written by Eubie Blake. Mills also later performed in Europe. She was born in 1896 and died at the young age of thirty-one (31), in 1927.Florence Mills led an interesting life. I have spent my afternoon researching this outstanding performer. I recommend this book to young children, especially those interested in performing acts.Black History Month Read ",
            "Florence Mills, born in an itsy-bitsy, teeny-whiny house, grew up with a big voice compared to thunder and rain. A voice that would bring shivers to the spines of those fortunate to hear her powerful voice.This biography, written and drawn for children, shares and illustrates how Miss Mills chose to use her angelic voice to help others, while fighting for desegregated audiences and singing opportunities. Any child would enjoy these story, particularly those in need of seeing their faces and voices in children's literature. Ah, to hear Miss Mills now, thundering down the pain and ignorance plaguing society today.5/5 Invitations to the Ziegfeld Follies",
            "Text to Self: Florence Mills grew up in a \u201cteeny-tiny, itsy-bitsy house\u201d in Washington, D.C. Her mother sang spirituals to calm her fears during thunder storms. Part of a famous spiritual was quoted in the book. This is Horatio Spafford\u2019s song titled It is Well with My Soul:When peace, like a river, attendeth my way,When sorrows like sea billows roll,Whatever my lot, Thou hast taught me to say,It is well, it is well with my soul. I grew up in a \u201cteeny-tiny, itsy-bitsy house\u201d in Upland, California. My grandfather used to sing old spirituals to me. One of them was Spafford\u2019s hymn. I immediately identified with this book because there is something precious about having a beloved adult pour music into your life. I can still see him at the kitchen table tapping out the rhythm on the gleaming formica. Like Florence, I still recall these lyrics, and others, in times of need or remembrance.Multiple Perspectives/Values: Florence\u2019s exceptional character shines when she asks herself questions throughout the book. \u201cIf my voice is powerful enough to stop the rain, what else can it do?\u201d If my voice can take me around the world, what else can it do?\u201d Florence lived to use her talent to help those less fortunate than herself. She sacrificed fortune to help other, less known black singers have a chance to perform. The perspectives in the story were one sided and life is seen only through the eyes of black artists. It examines how the world at turn of the twentieth century impacted the daughter of former slaves. Examples include: Whites only theaters, the Harlem Renaissance, segregated ships, and show boycotts.Bloom\u2019s QuestionsRemembering: How does Florence Mills\u2019 ability to sing impact the lives of others?Understanding: Retell the story in twelve words or less.Application: Give two examples from the story that show how Florence helped others.Analyzing: How would you compare Florence\u2019s first trip to London with her second trip?Evaluating: Would you recommend this book to others to read?

            "Harlem's Little Blackbird by Renee Watson (a 2013 Carter G. Woodson Honor Award book)Copyright: 2012Genre: Biography, this is the real story of Florence Mills written by another person, Renee Watson.Target Audience: Primary Florence Mills was a superstar during the Harlem Renaissance, a time when all kinds of creative minds contributed to Harlem's cultural movement of art, music, and literature. Whenever music would play, Florence's hands got to waving, her hips got to shaking, and her feet strutted and glided across the pavement. Florence was a little girl with big talent who grew into a worldwide, sought-after sensation. She performed all over, at Harlem's Lincoln Theatre and the London Pavilion to the stages of Broadway. People loved her! Come see the woman who sings like a bird. When she dances, it's as if she's flying! Text-to-Self: Florence performed with her two sisters in a singing and dancing trio, and this made me think of performing (sometimes competitively) with my sister. We grew up tap dancing, and we did it everywhere! Double pullbacks down the grocery store aisle. Seven-count riffs on the elevator floor. Traveling time steps in the driveway. We were repeatedly asked by teachers to stop tapping our feet under our desks. Like Florence, we whoorled around and boogied down.Always.Text-to-Text: I read in Harlem's Little Blackbird that Florence Mills had an impact on the music of people like Lena Horne, Paul Robeson, and Duke Ellington, and this called to mind Little Melba and Her Big Trombone by Kathryn Russell Brown. This book tells the story of Melba Liston, a girl who started playing the trombone at the age of seven. (Here, I'm reminded of Florence. Each girl received recognition at an early age for her respective talent.) From as far back as her memory would go, Melba loved the sound of music. Blues, jazz, and gospel rhythms danced in her head. Melba's talent grew and she became a master musician. She composed and arranged music, spinning rhythms, harmonies, and melodies into gorgeous songs...Dizzy Gillespie, Duke Ellington, Quincy Jones and more--wanted some 'Melba magic.' Text-to-World: Florence won a role in the off-Broadway performance of Shuffle Along in 1921. (This was her breakthrough moment.) Currently, Shuffle Along is in previews and opens on Broadway April 28, 2016! (http://shufflealongbroadway.com/)",
            "Harlem's Little Blackbird: The Story of Florence Mills by Ren\u00e9e Watson is such a wonderful story about the dream of a little girl named Florence who was born at the turn of the twentieth century in Washington D.C. who had a beautiful singing voice and a wonderful dancing talent. She was no stranger to racism, and when she moved to New York City the stages became bigger and the offers of making her an international star were greater. But Florence would turn it down to perform in other shows that would promote other black performers and sing beautiful songs that would promote civil rights until her death.To relate this text to myself, I would say that I think Florence has a positive attitude like myself and she didn't let the fear and hatred of racism stop her from doing what she wanted. In fact, she even used her talents to sing about civil rights and try to change people's minds. Unlike Florence, I do not have a sweet, birdlike singing voice, but it doesn't mean I still don't sing with the children at my work!A text-to-text relation that I would choose it Mirette on the High Wire by Emily Arnold McCully. In this children's book, a young French girl named Mirette lives in a boardinghouse. One day, a new resident named Bellini comes to live there and she is intrigued. He turns out to be a famous tightrope walker and after some persistence, Mirette persuades Bellini to teach her. Mirette never gives up and through her hard work, she ends up performing with Bellini and becomes famous. Florence is just like her because they both worked hard and didn't give up until they got what they wanted.A text-to-world example would be any time anyone has ever kept working hard to achieve their goals. Sometimes, with achieving their goals, they can change the course of their life, another's life, or the world. For example, a nine year old boy named Caine really wanted to make an arcade and have people play his games. So he spent a summer in his dad's auto parts shop and built an arcade out of boxes. But no one came to play. However he was not discouraged and eventually a man came buy who was fascinated with Caine's arcade that he got a lot of people to come and play. Now people all over have competitions to see who can make the best arcade to help fundraise money. And Caine got his wish.",
            "You can be forgiven for not knowing Florence Mills. No recordings or film of her performances exist. And according to the author\u2019s note at the end of the story, what we know about her singing is through what other sources report about her. It brings to mind the lighthouse of Alexandria.The book is a little text heavy, but is really captivating. I read the story to my test subject (my four-year-old daughter) and she asked to re-read it several times. Mills was a woman of principle and she used her fame to support others and not just herself. She gave to the poor and helped other black performers. She also faced a lot of racism. Watson addresses it rather matter of factly without dwelling on it. The text also provides enough context for kids approaching this on their own to know it was Mills\u2019 race that caused the discrimination and they see how she tried to combat it. I think this provides a very good opportunity for parents and educators to discuss racism. I also think teachers can introduce other black performers who helped break the racial barrier, such as Marian Anderson. Combined with other picture book biographies I think this could make a very interesting study of black entertainers and the discrimination they faced even when they were invited into white spaces. Watson has also woven in lyrics from various songs which, if you know the tunes, could make for a really great read aloud experience.I love Robinson\u2019s illustrations. The big-eyed Florence is totally endearing. The cut paper/collage style of the pictures and bright colors match the liveliness and adventure of Florence\u2019s life. The scene of her funeral is particularly moving with the blackbirds silhouetted against the white sky and earth-toned buildings. Small blackbirds appear first on the endpapers and make cameos throughout the story as a small nod to Mills nickname. I thought that was clever and it was fun for my daughter to find them as we read.I think this book is well worth adding to biography collections in libraries. There are more famous entertainers from the same era that could be argued to be more essential, but if you have money I highly recommend it."

            "This isn't worth reading because it's more like the first chapter of a book, or part of a short story. Cool idea- not even close to enough words. I like Mira Grant's writing and was hoping for a complete short story. ",
            "This novella cost less than the price of a good cup of coffee yet I still felt a bit cheated.This is one of the few author who normally publish quite meaty novellas, all of them never less than 100 pages so this 15 page one was definitely not expected. I didn\u2019t even look at the length before buying this because I thought after reading 4 of her novellas I knew what to expect.So although a let-down in terms of quantity, the quality was still as good as her other work in the Feed series yet this one was too short to leave a lasting positive impression.This can\u2019t be read as a standalone so if you are a fan of this series then you will most probably read this regardless of my review, just prepare yourself for the (inadequate) length of the story.If you have no idea who Mira Grant is and you are open to reading zombie themed books I can highly recommend that you start with Feed",
            "The Good: I never buy short stories, but since I've loved everything written by Mira Grant, I decided to give this one a shot. It was much shorter than I expected, but the story was totally worth the purchase. This story was utterly captivating. Good premise, huge tension, abrupt on-point ending, every element of the story perfectly executed. This is how you do a short story.The Bad: Not a thing. ",

It causes a weird disconnect that makes it difficult to enjoy in places because one or the other seems to be a cop-out. As if the author couldn't figure out how to move the plot along without randomly murdering a stack of characters who seemed to be able to take a beating just a moment ago. People can literally lose a hand mid-fight and keep going without blinking, but getting shot once can kill them? Why doesn't everyone just own a gun then? The rules of how much damage a body can withstand are insanely inconsistent to the point I'm actually writing about it. :pOtherwise, this is enjoyable though. Everyone is completely insane and there are enough subplots happening to keep things interesting. ",

            "With a title like this, it has to be Dave Barry, that irreverent scion of humorous journalism. Can you believe it? The powers-that-be allowed Barry to shadow the 2000 Presidential Conventions and election. If that weren't bad enough, they allowed him to report on the Olympics. The Olympic Committee will probably never let Dave Barry near any of the contests again.After Barry made mincemeat of the most famous races in the world and blew off the 2000 election season, he was off to more manly subjects: humvees, chain saws and appliances smarter than Dave Barry (most of them already are but there are more frightening ones on the horizon). Then North Dakota comes within Dave's 20-20 eyesight and he ridicules the population (of 15) so mercilessly that the state wants to drop the 'North' so folks think it is warmer than the state formerly-known-as North Dakota. To pay him back, the state names a sewage lifter after the famous pundit.But the thing that shocked me the most was the addition of the last two chapters. They are the two articles Dave Barry wrote after 9/11/2001. The man can write eloquent prose about serious subjects. Both are memorable but the thought behind 'Hallowed Ground' was particularly poignant. "

            "Excellent collection of essays. The September 11 essays show his true writing ability. ",
            "this book is a hilarious page turner. every chapter there are new stories that have funny bits all the way through.",
            "More top-notch humor from Dave Barry! Most of these columns were written in 2000 and 2001. It's easy to forget what that time was like. It was the very brink of 9/11, when we were all lazy and content and confident in our place in the world, completely oblivious to the idea that said world was about to change drastically. I think my favorite piece in here is about smart house technology. Now it's a common thing to be able to communicate with your fridge. Back then it was unthinkable. Barry complained about how he already had a method of knowing if he needed milk: I ask my wife if we need milk. Also, I wonder if anyone ever used any of his rock band names to actually name their rock band.The final two essays are, however, very serious. The first was written the day after 9/11, and the second was written one year later. You don't really think of Barry as writing about serious things, but I have read an essay or two (and a couple of novels), and I know he's very good at it. The first will bring you back to 9/11 itself, and it will remind you of what you felt on that day. I remember it vividly because my father was on a plane coming to see me on that day. Thankfully his plane was grounded in Nebraska, far away from any terrorist.The second one, however, is more heartrending. Barry compares the field where United 93 came down to Gettysburg Cemetery. It's haunting, and it will make you at least tear up a bit. So read this book for the laughs, but don't forget these last two essays. Hell, I don't think you'll be able to. They will stick with you for the rest of your life.",
            "This book came to me at the right time in my life. No one like Dave Barry to remind us that politics is what it's been for a long time, parenting is ridiculous no matter when it occurs, North Dakota is just great for the humor-writer-turned-travel-writer, and some things aren't funny at all but worth writing about, too.Thanks, Dave. It was a pleasure.",
            "This is a collection of his newspaper columns from 2000 to 2003. Most are funny but a bit dated (Remember hanging chads?). His last two are on the 9/11 events and really change the tone of the book, not in a good way. Remember\u2026 Dave Barry can be rearranged to spell Brave Yard. "

Within hours of his wife\u2019s death, her employer proposes marriage, and within days the couple has set sail for the oil fields of Argentina. They settle in the rough coastal town of Comodoro Rivadavia, where Minke eventually learns that her husband is not a successful trader, but a morphine producer. The future that seemed so bright takes an even darker turn the morning their toddler son, Zeff, is kidnapped. Soon after, morphine production is outlawed and her husband must immediately emigrate to New York. Already pregnant with their daughter, Minke has little choice but to wait for the new baby\u2019s arrival, then follow Sander to America, and leave her firstborn behind forever. However when she arrives in New York and discovers that her husband has betrayed her, she takes her daughter and leaves him, finds work as a seamstress, and vows to return to Argentina and find her son. How she manages to find her child, and how she takes her revenge on the people who orchestrated his abduction, is a triumphant tale of personal sacrifice, determination, and love. A sweeping saga that crosses three continents--from the opulent life in Amsterdam during the 1900s, to rough living on the Argentine coast, to the impoverished life of a recent immigrant to New York--A YOUNG WIFE is a journey no reader will forget.",

            "Absorbing - well written - a story spanning 3 continents.When 15-year-old Minke first glimpses her future husband, she knows he is older, wealthy, and that it is her older sister, not Minke, who is expecting to be hired to nurse his dying wife. However, Mr. Sander DeVries is persuasive - Minke is the one he thinks is most suitable - and in spite of her objections she ends up in a household not in harmony: the daughter is jealous of Minke and does not get along with DeVries, the brother is earnest but with physical limitations, and the dying woman is painfully counting her days. The wife soon passes away and before Minke has time to sort things through, the worldly Mr. DeVries comes courting - persuading everyone (except for the delightful old yenta-type neighbor who wields a poker iron - the traditional way to drive off a spurned suitor) - that marrying him is the right decision. They set off across the Atlantic for business ventures in the growing frontier of Argentina. But Minke never knew Mr. DeVries's line of work and he avoids answering unwanted questions by giving unrelated answers.Minke's story spans 3 continents - her fortunes soaring from wealthy 1st class traveler, to an immigrant arriving at Ellis Island hoping she will not be turned away.She is young, naive and trusting when the story begins - and also a loyal, honest, and true friend, traits that earn her allies when she needs them the most when she faces betrayal and treachery. I loved the descriptions of Argentina in its frontier days, the wonderful Wiley family in New York, and the whole immigrant experience with its richness and texture. Thank you goodreads-first reads!!"

            "When Minke is 15, a distinguished older man in a yellow car arrives at her parents\u2019 home looking for a girl to come to Amsterdam to nurse his ailing wife, Elisabeth. Minke\u2019s time with Elisabeth in the attic of her lavish home is short, but the two form a bond as Elisabeth relates her travels to Argentina through sporadic opium-induced dreams. Then, suddenly and almost without warning, Elisabth passes away and Sander DeVries\u2014the man who came to fetch Minke\u2014proposes to Minke, hoping to secure a new wife less than three days after his last has died. At first scandalized, but later charmed by Sander and his promises of adventure and beauty in Argentina, Minke accepts and the two are married in the old way, breaking a ring in the company of her family. Minke and Sander board a ship for Comodoro Rivadavia, along with Sander\u2019s business partner, Cassian, an enigmatic doctor charged with looking after Minke while Sander sees to his business ventures onboard. Minke\u2019s life settles into a series of peaks and valleys. She falls deeply in love with Sander, enjoying their nights together and his passion. But Sander often leaves her alone and in the dark, about himself and their future. The nature of his business is murky, mixed up in oil, shipping, and morphine, and he shows streaks of jealousy and possessiveness as Minke befriends some of the men onboard. At her first sight of Argentina, Minke is disappointed by the barren, dirty town, its houses with walls of corrugated iron and dirt floors, but she soon embraces her new surroundings, befriending the wild gauchos who ride into town to trade, much to the dislike of her husband. Minke will soon find out that Sander is not the man she thought he was and will have to fight for a happy future for herself and her children.A Young Wife is compelling, partially as it\u2019s based on the true story of the author\u2019s maternal grandmother. It\u2019s the second book I\u2019ve read this year that tells of women\u2019s struggles to carve out better lives for themselves and their children in male-dominated societies. (More on the first here.) Minke\u2019s voice is honest and clear and Lewis weaves a beautiful narrative. Some elements are a bit expected, but in general the story is fact-paced and engrossing. I could have done without Minke\u2019s secondary love interest and found Cassian inconsistent, sometimes acting in sinister capacities for Sander and sometimes proving Minke\u2019s ally. But these niggling points aside, it struck me that while Minke\u2019s story is a coming-of-age tale, it\u2019s also about a woman learning to understand a man and the progression of their relationship. We see Sander through Minke\u2019s eyes and though there are clues that he\u2019s duplicitous, we always have Minke\u2019s understanding and also her love for him, especially in the first portion of the book. As their story unfolds, we see what Minke thought was a love story dissolve into a tragedy. But with this dissolution, Minke learns about herself and grows up. She is, after all, a very young wife.Would I recommend? I enjoyed this book and read it quickly. It has many elements that I am drawn to: a strong female narrator, a historical basis, and travel to exotic locales. Though a few plot points didn\u2019t come together for me, A Young Wife is emotionally honest a worth a look for fans of historical fiction and romance.For more of my reviews, visit yearofmagicalreading.wordpress.com",
            "This is another book that I won through the FirstReads program and definitely a great read! In the Netherlands in 1912, at the age of 15, Minke is taken from her family to work as a nurse to a wealthy older man's dying wife. After she dies, he proposes to her and after Minke marries him, they sail to Argentina, where he's talked about the two of them starting up a new life in this soon-to-be prosperous place. It's a hard life there, and only a few years later, Minke finds herself following her husband to New York, where she lives as a poor immigrant trying to create a better life.Although parts of this book were a little predictable, it was a quick read and yet felt like a sweeping saga because it covered so much ground. Minke is a likable character and I couldn't help but sympathize with her. It's easy to think how different her life would have been had the story taken place in the current times, but what made this such a compelling read for me is the fact that she really didn't have much of a choice or say in so much of what happened. The author did a great job describing life in the Netherlands, Argentina, and America during the early 20th century, images came to my mind easily. I wish the ending had gone on a little longer, but it was still very satisfying as a whole. I loved being able to follow Minke through so many struggles, rooting for her to suceed the entire way when she was forced to go through so many hardships. I really enjoyed this book and would definitely recommend it to others!"

The name of the heroine, Small Hope, is a little obvious but works nonetheless.So much to explore, so many details, in the illustrations from the small panels on each of the two-page spreads to the large color illustration (except for when Small first meets the Black Dog, which of course needs to dominate the two pages). Warm colors for the interiors help convey the coziness and safety of the house and family contrasted with the starker colors of the cold, snowy outside. Small with her yellow coat and green boots offers the only spot of color when she first meets Black Dog, but as she leads him around outside and he becomes smaller, more spots of color appear (love the playground with the elephant slides!).By the way, can you find the toy octopus on each two-page spread showing the inside of the house (except the very last page)? The first page is the hardest because the octopus isn't in color.",
            "An odd story about how fear magnifies what it is you fear. Each family member in this tale looks outside and sees a black dog that gets bigger and bigger as their fear of it increases. Only one little girl isn't afraid to confront it. What happens to her? Read and find out!I loved the detailed illustrations here. A little green toy octopus, assorted cats, little figurines also looking scared, and carved toy owls are a few of the objects strewn about and peeking around corners. The house has a cozy feeling, which contrasts with the cold winter whiteness outside. No wonder this won the Kate Greenaway Medal! Recommended for a wintry day read. "

            "It has been awhile since I\u2019ve found a book worth a full five star rating, especially a business book. Most are filled with superficial anecdotes, tips, and fake motivation that only the brain dead appreciate. Being a good leader is being a good parent is being a good spouse. It doesn\u2019t stop at business, these skills carry over to all of your relationships, especially the ones that (should) matter most. The book describes all types of leaderships, from the dreaded boss that pretends to work while leaving the rest to the few capable workers and working them to the bone until they leave to be treated better elsewhere, resulting in the company only having average or below average workers. We have all experienced bosses like that, ruled by their ego, who think they\u2019re great because of a title, but are threatened by anyone who actually shows promise of real skill. They create a toxic work place. They ruin the company. Then it describes the boss everyone wishes they had and few have the courage to become. The one that leads with understanding, and treats employees as humans not machines, and values their personal goals and desires along with kindling their skills for the workplace. The boss that saves the day- not through her own brilliance but because she is able to cultivate the brilliance of her team. The company flourishes and the work place is safe to create creative solutions and problem solve laterally. Rules aren\u2019t black and white and there\u2019s flexibility for humans to be humans. The main message is an obvious one that unfortunately many forget: the greatest asset of a company is its people. The people make the company. Without people, there\u2019s no company. Your company isn\u2019t succeeding because of a playbook or a script. It\u2019s succeeding because of the people leading it, the better they lead, the better the results.",

            "To LEAD means a great deal to so many people and organizations as well as sports teams and politics. But to lead successfully is a whole new ball game, with that this book shares the 5 stages of growth in terms of what being a leader entails. John Maxwell, leadership guru explains the pros and cons of each level one must achieve in order to grow to the next level while maintaining what he/she has learned at previous level. Excellent book on the levels of being a leader. ",
            "Great book! In this quick read, John C. Maxwell breaks down the complexity of successful leadership into 5 incredibly easy-to-understand steps:Step 1 - I do it (competence).Step 2 - I do it and you are with me (demonstration).Step 3 - You do it an I am with you (coaching).Step 4 - You do it (empowerment).step 5 - You do it and someone is with you (reproduction).Brilliant!",
            "John Maxwell's book, How Successful People Lead, is a quick easy read of many ideas you've probably heard before and a handful of ideas that you may not have. Maxwell's main point is that the best leaders are selfless servants who devote themselves to the success of their organizations and invest in the people they lead. This idea sounds a lot like Matthew 20:25-27. If the reader is familiar with the concept of the servant leader, there will be very little in the book that sounds new. The one really helpful idea that I hadn't heard before is that there are five levels of leadership. Good leaders will move up through the levels, never really losing the previous level but adding to it. Bad leaders will become stuck along the way. The first level is position - I'm the boss, do what I say. The second level is permission - Follow me because you know I care about you. The third level is production - Follow me because I have accomplished good things for the organization. The fourth level is people development - Follow me and I will help you to become better at what you do. The final level is the pinnacle - Follow me and I will help you to become a level four leader. The ideas in the book are relatively simple, but implementing them is very challenging. I would recommend this book as a quick review of servant leadership and for its specific ideas about leadership at the five levels.",
            "Insightful little compact book. I bought this after reading his Irrefutable Laws of Leadership. This is another great one, and mentions more corporate / office applications for management and/or executive leadership vs. ILOL which is more general. Even if you're not in one of these positions, read this book to learn what great leadership and well-lead organizations actually look like! (big picture, this is the stuff they don't teach ya in college!)"

            "The first issue, or at least the first half of the first issue, are spectacular. The first scene has an intense emotional impact, and it's the perfect way to hammer home just how dire the situation is for mutants now. And the last scene is great, too, entirely unexpected. Interested to see where that's going. In between, it's ok, but nothing special. Too much like too many other stories I've read. ",
            "The world hates all mutants now that Magneto went along and fucked up the world. Oh you didn't read Ultimatium? Well that's good. IT WAS HORRIBLE. Basically Mag goes nuts and sends a tidal wave to take out New York. In the process he kills a ton of heroes and then other villains eat other heroes (yes, the blob eats the wasp...no I'm not joking) and just a ton of dumb shit happened. So can we recover? Kind of. I never read these even though I read all of Ultimate X-Men back in the day. I figured I'd give it a try when saw it on my Library Shelf. Kitty, Iceman, and Mr. Flame on (Human Torch) are in hiding. On top of that we show Wolverine's Son (jimmy I believe) who makes a small cameo at the start and then comes back for about 2 minutes later. He's kind of useless and the cover is a big lie but whatevas. Either way we begin to form a new X-Men team, though underground, against Snyder who is a crazy God Loving man trying to destroy all mutants. While that's happening the government is working with Pedro and yeah, just a ton of shit happening at once. What I liked: The start was great. Really shows how much fear people have that they'd kill their own child. Sick but easy to see in this disturbed world. I also enjoyed Kitty basically running shit. She's actually my favorite X-Men of the ultimate universe. Also Iceman and Human Torch play good off each other. Their dialog is fun and easy to go with and a few laughs to be had. The art is solid and easy to follow through. What I didn't like: Stryker was kind of meh as a villain. THe fact they trusted quick silver is fucking DUMB. Also Jimmy is pretty much useless. The pacing alters from fast paced to slow as snails at times too. Overall not a bad start. I think I'll continue. It reminds me mostly of most of Ultimate X-men. Fun but silly and dumb. Maybe it'll get better? Let's find out! ",
            "This starts out OK - feeling original - but then quickly devolves to a tedious conflagration of retread repeat stories from old X-Men books, plus kinda boring and repetitive exposition.The religious sermons and proselytising are nothing new - we've heard it all before (multiple times) and it doesn't even move the plot or understanding of the characters forward - feels like pure page filler, or maybe an exercise by the writer in channeling a preacher. I guess every writer has to do it once, get it out of their system. Wish it didn't have to drag down this X book tho - boring and distracting from a storyline that doesn't need it, and which makes this feel like just another iteration of the same old stories that Marvel has done plenty before.You know what would make this a fresh take? What if the religious whacko actually *did* show some divine powers (or at least make you wonder)?At least once we get to the big reveals, we get to see some interesting plot points unfold. I'm happy enough to get a chance for a few surprises. ",

            "OK so I'm coming in late to the party here...I think this is part of the second wave of Ultimate Comics titles.Magneto made some massive attack on NYC, causing flooding and killing millions...this led to mutants being put into concentration camps and shoot to kill orders.This team consists of: Kitty Pryde (known as Shroud here, not Shadowcat), Bobby Drake (still Iceman), Johnny Storm (Human Torch - the FF are no longer, and even though he's not quite a mutant, he somehow fits here), and Jimmy Hudson, the son of Wolverine. Rogue also shows up, and there's some appearances by other characters (Quicksilver, Colossus, Karen Grant Jean Grey, Storm, Nick Fury).This is fun having them back as underground characters, and I like the team up of Fire/Ice, they have a great chemistry here. Jimmy Hudson is a chip off the old block, and that's the best possible thing here. Rogue is her mysterious good/bad/who knows self, except now she's hearing things from God who tells her what to do to save the world.The book gets bogged down in the sermonizing of main bad guy (William Stryker Jr. - who's a sort of human/Sentinel hybrid preaching religious zealot wanting to eradicate mutants) and the usual crap that's been done lots before.However, there is potential here, and the last page, and the reveal of who Rogue has been talking to as God makes me smile and gives that 'Geek out' moment where the possibilities for storylines just open right up. LOVE it. I think last page cliffhangers are great to get you on an upswing heading into the next book/volume.Worth a read, though I suppose knowing the earlier history of Ultimate X-Men/Ultimate X, etc. would be good.",
            "The X-Men have disbanded. Mutants are rounded up and put into camps. Militias are following Stryker\u2019s lead, executing \u2018illegals\u2019 on sight. The relationship between human and mutant have never been so frayed. With civilization on the brink of collapse, the new mutants are on the run.Better to die fighting for your freedom than to live the rest of your life as a slave. Essentially the mantra of the new team now comprised of Kitty Pride, Bobby Drake (Iceman) Jonny Storm (Human Torch), Rogue, and Wolverine\u2019s son, Jimmy Hudson. Storm and Colossus are imprisoned in an experimental camp. The only other surviving member, Jean Grey, has disguised herself among the masses as Karen Grant, gathering a few other derelicts to take refuge in the proto-state, Tian, before succumbing to despotism. In the new mutants quest to take down Stryker, and to liberate the south west from the robotic grasp of Master Mold, Kitty Pryde\u2019s X-Men, without Jonny, leave Morlock\u2019s tunnel and become freedom fighters.The once squeamish, naive young girl takes center stage, growing to be a powerful, independent, and strong-willed leader who\u2019s not afraid of making the hard decision that includes killing Stryker, destroying Tian, and standing up to the military forces who want to repossess their sovereign land. With the mental resiliency of Xavier and strength of Magneto, \u201cvindication of purpose and integrity,\u201d Pryde becomes the worthy successor to Cyclops. Her awareness leads to mutant revolution, her leadership leads to mutant liberation, and her hope leads to a better life for mutants. Signs of characters that can extract right from the righteousness and distinguish strength from power. As nothing is more symbolic than the sanctuary the mutants literally built from nothing but dirt, desiccated plaines terraforming into a promise land from the propagation of sentient plant life. And instead of abusing the gift for her own gain, or seeking the destruction of mankind, she shares her gift to the world.  The new X-Men is Kitty Pryde\u2019s X-Men. A true character story."

            "The time is ... steampunk, the place is Britain and the story is thoroughly enjoyable.The world of espionage, in this book, is split into two factions. The Company formed in America to prevent British imperialism from taking over the land and then spread into other nations. They oppose The Wardens Of The Realm on all fronts. The Wardens, or W.O.R. work against them and for Britain or possibly an empire? Not too sure if Britain has an empire here.Claire is a top Company operative, smart, strong and sassy with an impressive Company presence, she has thrown it all away in a second to avenge her brother, also a company agent who was betrayed by their employer.Alastair is a top Warden operative who has been stung by Company women before, he will not trust this one and tries to deny the attraction he feels for her when he encounters her as a prisoner of the Wardens.Together they go on a mission, Clarie can identify the man who killed her brother, though covertly she means to kill him rather than deliver him to the Wardens. Alaistar is there to make sure they are captured and that she does not escape.It is actually an exceptionally well written story, the increasing attachment between our leading lady and man is believable as well as hot and the background world is a lot of fun. It has restored my interest in Steampunk since the last couple of 'steampunk type' books I read were bad. If this comes from the Steampunk community then it still has mojo.My only complaint would be that the 'twists' to the plot were more flat than twisted, so that one could see the great expose of the finale coming miles away. Though that did not bother me too much in the end, as the reading experience, with its submersibles, grand cruises and corsets was such a fun ride."

            "There's two things we can say about the Earl of Wolfred :- He's a real good man-He's not lucky in loveOnce in love with his best friend's wife, he began to believe maybe he had a chance with her after the man disappear for years. But when Lucas came back, Alistair's hope died. Then his last mission turned dramatic, almost tragic, when he was betrayed by an other woman he developed feelings for. When a member of the Company (the enemy clan) and former mistress of Lucas when he was amnesic, is captured by his group of spies, the Warden, and the woman offer them information and her help to catch an other member of the Company who betrayed her, Alastair volunteer to serve as liaison with Claire to prevent Arden and Lucas marital's problems, no matter that he doesn't trust the young woman. Claire doesn't care to work with the enemy if it means finding the bastard who killed her brother. But she doesn't need to tell them why she's really turning her back on the Company, right ? But why the man with the altered animal eyes and metal in the hands suddenly seems so appealing to her ? I dare you to not fall for the hero. I felt for him when we first met him in the first book of the series but in this one, we see the extent of his kindness, how generous, good-hearted and self-sacrificing he is and how good a friend he is. The way he felt for the bold and feisty Claire was beautiful to see. This story had such a surprising twist that I never saw coming. I'm glad I discovered this series.",
            "I got what I expected: an adventure story with love whose erotic parts did not take over.I liked that the female main character was strong, her goal had in mind and nevertheless allowed to be weak without being treated condescending.Volume 3 I'm next next!",
            "Review originally posted at Ramblings From This Chick I don't even know where to begin with this book. First I will say that prior to reading Touch of Steel, I had not read anything in the Steampunk genre before. Secondly, why haven't I? Yeah, I loved this book. For real. I love the mix of modern with historical. Kate Cross created a world that felt real to me. Not only did she create this wonderful fantastical world, but she created a group of characters that I was really taken with and I found myself on the edge of my seat wondering what would happen with everyone.Claire Brooks is a spy on a mission. She is out to kill the man that she feels is responsible for the death of her beloved brother Robert. She almost succeeds when she is injured and then captured by the Wardens, a rival spy group. When she makes a deal with the Wardens that she will give up any secrets of the Company's (the spy group she works for) in exchange for her release to enact vengeance on her brother, she is in turn placed into the custody of Alistair Payne one of the Wardens top spies.Alistair wants nothing to do with Claire Brooks. There is something about her he doesn't trust. He knows she is hiding something and he's bound to find out what it is. Yet, he made a promise that he would escort her to find the man responsible not only for the death of her brother, but the man responsible for his best friend Lucas's memory loss. Even though Alistair and Claire dislike each other immensely both can't help but find the other attractive. Though beyond a small kiss, neither acts on the growing attraction.Slowly but surely the farther along in their travels they get the harder they are finding it to resist one another. Both find that they really can't trust the other, especially in the case of Alistair with Claire. Alistair has been burned and deceived by women in his past so it's even harder for him to let Claire in. Yet, even though he can't really trust her he is quickly realizing that he just might not care.As for Claire she's realizing the more time she spends with Alistair the more she is growing to like and appreciate him. In a different world he would be the man she would want to marry but here and now, with her future looking all but non existent, she knows that she must keep focused on her mission, you take down the man who killed her brother.I can't say how much I enjoyed this book. The action, adventure, the romance, it was all so very good. Kate Cross crafted a winner with Touch of Steel and I very much it enjoyed it. I am eagerly awaiting the next book in her Clockwork Agents series. If it's half as good as Touch of Steel was I know I'm in for a treat.**ARC provided by Author**",
            "Well, I liked this one better than Heart of Brass, primarily because I found Claire to be much more like-able than Arden. I'm not totally sold on this series but the 3rd book, Breath of Iron, is about Dr. Evelyn Stone. Dr. Stone has intrigued me from the beginning and I do want to learn more about her backstory.",
            "Touch of Steel, Clockwork Agents #2, by Kate CrossGrade: A\u201cYou try to be so hard and tough, but beneath that you are a good man, and no woman can resist that. I don\u2019t care how well-trained or determined she is. You will make her want to please you, to win your trust and the ultimate prize of your heart, and then she\u2019s lost.\u201dClaire Brooks has been a spy for The Company, an American spy agency, since she was fifteen years old and joined with her brother Robert. Claire, aka The Dove, has betrayed her agency and is out for revenge on the man who killed Robert in a fire. On the hunt Claire is shot and ends up in The Warden\u2019s, the British spy agency, custody where she is shocked to be shown kindness and a chance to get her revenge by switching sides. Claire will do anything to avenge her brother\u2019s death and agrees to accompany Alastair Payne to capture the men involved.Alastair Payne, Earl of Wolfred, always knew he would be a Warden just like his mother and father were but he never expected to be double crossed by her former mistress and left for dead. Now more robot than man Alastair is determined to show everyone that he is a good spy and won\u2019t let a woman get the best of him again. Until he meets Claire Brooks. Claire is not to be trusted but the more time together Alastair sees deeper into her soul and why she needs revenge. The love affair could ruin them both or cost them their lives but they both know it can only end in heartache.Touch of Steel is hands down the best steampunk-romance book that I have read in 2012 and maybe ever. The world Kate Cross has created is amazingly complex with spies, double crossings and everyone out to save their way of life. Nothing is this world is perfect and both Claire and Alastair have their share of tragedies and hardships that make them the driven people they are. The blend of the Victorian Age with the autotrons, and wonderful gadgets that Arden comes up with make this a world that I never want to leave.We meet Alastair in the first book Heart of Brass and he comes full circle in Touch of Steel and I liked him so much better this time around. Alastair wants nothing to do with Claire but he knows how valuable she is at bringing down important people in the company. The more time he spends with her he learns what we readers already know: she\u2019s an amazing woman who fights for what she loves and will do anything for the people close to her. He can\u2019t help falling for her and the adventure they go on is an amazing ride of twists, turns and some very steamy scenes.Claire is one of my new favorite heroines and she is a badass. She hangs with the boys, is an amazing spy and has a fan made with knives. I want to be her when I grow up so badly. Claire is on a mission and nothing will stop her from reaching her goal except her feelings that develop for Alastair. There is a huge plot twist towards the end of the book and it throws Claire\u2019s world upside down.I can\u2019t say much more without giving too much away but this book is mind blowing. If you love steampunk as much as I do you must read this series that is only getting better. I can\u2019t wait for the next book because these are now at the top of my Must Read Pile. ",
            "Loved this one too! I've liked Alistair since the first book so I was excited to get his story. I think one of my favorite aspects of this series is that all the characters are slightly older, more mature, all have sexual experience and prior relationships, including the accompanying emotional baggage. For me, that goes along really well with the premise of experienced spies and the gritty world this is set in, and makes the couples' journey together even better! "

            "Sister Mary of St. Peter was an extremely pious Carmelite nun of the first half of the nineteenth century. She was favored\u2014if you can call it that (many of us today might not think her life so \u2018favored\u2019 with all she suffered)\u2014by numerous visits and associated revelations from Jesus, where He tasked her with the difficult mission of reparation for blasphemy and abuse of Sunday observance. The first part of the book, approximately half, is Sister Mary\u2019s autobiography, written in obedience to her Mother Superior. Her extreme humility takes some getting used to for twenty-first century readers, but be assured she is the real deal. Although even her contemporaries have problems taking her seriously, she means every word. As soon as she starts quoting Jesus, this becomes increasingly obvious. Sister lived a simple live and from an early age desired to enter Carmel, but like other better known Carmelite saints, Th\u00e9r\u00e8se de Lisieux and Elizabeth of the Trinity, her desire was tested with adversity before she was able to enter. Most of what we learn about her life in Carmel in this first section is before the revelations begin. This portion of the text concludes on June 13, 1847, a little over a year before her rather sudden death. The second part of the book, the Revelations on the Work of Reparation Given by Our LORD to Sr. Mary, is the collection of her accounts of each separate revelation from Our LORD and what He tasked her with at the time. She includes the date of the revelation, brief explanatory information on significant events since the last revelation, where, when and how Our LORD revealed Himself to her, what He said and/or tasked her with. In the beginning, He was preparing her for her mission by testing her obedience to her superiors, strengthening her through addition prayer practices and assignments which she found more repugnant to her spiritual sensibilities. As time went by, He began revealing her mission to her which was to remedy the insults to God\u2019s Holy Name and the Abuse of Sunday, by the new devotion He gave her to His Holy Face.Jesus explained to Sr. Mary that when a man\u2014or woman, but Jesus said a \u2018man\u2019 so I will stick to his words\u2014is insulted, called names, his whole countenance\u2014his face\u2014changes in appearance. No matter how he tries to hide it, if it happens enough, his face will begin to take on the look of defeat, pain, sorrow and remorse for the hatred shown to him by the insults to his good name. Likewise, the remedy for insults (called blasphemies) to God\u2019s Name, are honor shown to His Holy Face. To that end, Jesus gave Sister a number of prayers, but especially recommended \u2018The Golden Arrow\u2019: May the most holy, most sacred, most adorable,most incomprehensible and ineffable Name of God be forever praised, blessed, loved, adoredand glorified in Heaven, on earth,and under the earth,by all the creatures of God,and by the Sacred Heart of Our Lord Jesus Christ,in the Most Holy Sacrament of the Altar.Amen. The last revelation which Sister Mary relates is from April 1847. The rest of her story is taken from the Appendix written by Fr. Eric Scallan who tells us that she spoke valiantly to the bishop\u2019s secretary to get canonical approval for Work of Reparation to the Holy Face and was turned down flat, although previously the bishop had been very encouraging, even saying he was quite sure she had not been deceived as to the authenticity of the revelations. Sister Mary accepted the decision peacefully yet never lost hope that they would one day be approved and promulgated. As she had always been obedient in spirit, so she was now. Not long afterwards, though she had been in excellent health, she was taken sick and died not four months later. She died in the odor of sanctity in the 33rd year of her life on July 8th 1948.After her death, Reparation through the Devotion to the Holy Face was chiefly kept up through the fervor of a wealthy retired lawyer of Tours, a devoted friend of the Carmelite nun, Leo Dupont. There are two other books* written by Dorothy Scallan, the sister of Fr. Scallan, the priest mentioned above, plus another book written by a woman in our local area, Veronica's Veil: Companion Prayer Book. There is much more to learn on this subject! However, I am sure Sister Mary would advocate for prayer and reparation over learning, or at least after it, and this book contains a number of other prayers in addition to The Golden Arrow above. Sr. Mary tells us that Jesus, \u2018warned her that she should not be disappointed if she did not feel any particular gratifying emotions while reciting the Prayers of Reparation. The demon would give me an aversion for this devotion, but not to worry about it, that the excellence of this devotion surpasses other devotions. It is pleasing to God, the Angels and Saints and beneficial to the Church. \u201cOh, if you only knew what great merit you acquire by saying even once, \u2018Admirable in the Name of God,\u2019 in the spirit of reparation for blasphemy!\u201d\u2019EXCELLENT book!January 25, 2020: Have had this for several months now but not had the chance to begin. The first few chapters were a bit difficult to get into. Pious nineteenth century nuns have a way of writing which takes a bit of getting used to. You have to peal away several layers of 21st century cynicism from your own eyes, much of which you do not even realize is there. The best analogy I can think of is when you get a cataract removed. You don't even know how dark your view until after the surgery.That is why it is so good for me to read works like this. It helps me see that the way our Age views the world is not the way people from other ages have seen things. Granted, Sr. Mary of St. Peter was considered eccentric even by the standards of her own time, as can be seen by the way her superiors handle her conversations with Jesus. Their handling of her, however, only gives the book, the revelations, credibility. If I had been them, I should have been skeptical of her as well. And yet, I also admire her childlike simplicity, while I find it a bit hard to relate to. Maybe it would be different if I were to meet her. I wonder.... *Discovered there are two other books associated with these revelations: Holy Man of Tours and The Whole World Will Love Me which give background on Sr. Marie and her influence over the Little Flower.",

            "Soyinka\u2019s prison memoir The Man Died is both a testament of endurance under duress and a powerful piece of literature in its own merit. In 1967, Soyinka was arrested for a period of 22 months and held in solitary confinement in a 4ft. by 8ft. cell. However, the book is not a memoir in the sense that this happened, then this happened and then\u2026 The text itself is a partial representation of the facts as far as they can be evidenced or researched, and a partial stream-of-consciousness into the spiraling chaos of a mind entrapped in entropy is deprived of contact with the outside world, is deprived of books, is deprived of news (with only a few rare exceptions), is deprived of anything we take for granted, like a decent meal or a toilet bowl. And it is in this intertwining dance between chapters of events and circumstances that led to his imprisonment and chapters bordering on the inner psyche of a man about to lose his mind that the power of his narrative lies\u2014between the real and the surreal. Whatever one wants to make of history in hindsight will often depend on the philosophical context of the present day. Thus, without going into the justice or injustice of it all, what matters is the sheer willpower of Soyinka to not only withstand the torment he underwent but to even fight it by occasional bouts of fasting, at his peril. When the decision to fast is taken, I dwell on the next meal in my mind, I let my body crave it and I let the food come to me. I am hungry. \u2026 A fierce protest commences in the pit of my stomach and I let it rage. Armed with the power of my veto, I stand aside and enjoy the violent conflict, waiting for my cue to thump the gavel.Fasting was really a gamble, were it up to his imprisoners and the then head-of-state Gowon, they would have probably liked nothing more than to see Soyinka die. But, with the whole world watching, and with prominent voices shouting, they dared not let this man die. Soyinka, however, captures the plight of another who was not as fortunate:The groans do not cease nor do they diminish. The bloodless inhuman steadiness of this sound of human suffering is the most unnerving aspect of it all. It does not come from volition but from weak inertia of a muted pulse. As if the man has merely left his mouth open and the sound emerges with his breathing out.It is close to dawn when the sound stops. Abruptly. No weakening ever, neither faltering nor a rallying intensity. I knew it is over.\u2026Soon it is the hour when \u2018all the dead awaken.\u2019 As the key turns in my lock I ask the warder what became of the suffering man.\u2018The man died,\u2019 he said.So, what according to the military government was Soyinka\u2019s crime that warranted this harsh punishment (and unjust to any human being)? It was Soyinka trying physically, rather than with pen only, to help stop the Nigerian civil war as soon as it began. It was his meeting with the secessionist Igbo leader Ojukwu that landed him in prison, on some false pretext that he was supporting them in one way or another. Soyinka, however, met with senior commanders in the government, too. In the end, he wanted to form a third party, a pacifist one if you will, to intercede and bring both sides to a truce. But that never came to fruition. What is beautiful in this memoir is the sense of closure it must have offered its sufferer. For in writing there is catharsis\u2014be it pain or joy\u2014which spells relief. And as Nadine Gordimer eloquently summed it up in her essay \u2018Soyinka the Tiger:\u2019The Man Died is, in a very real and strange sense, the victory of art over all the forces of philistinism. We are inclined to forget that these include hatred and cruelty.I suppose that in the end, the man, Wole Soyinka, did die\u2014a necessary spiritual death, in order to be reborn cleansed from the hatred and cruelty that was plagued upon him. At least that is what I would like to imagine he achieved by sharing this book with us.",

            "It is bizarre to think that a distinguished, world class literary pearl like Soyinka spent years clamped in gaol. But then again, so did other African literary giants like Kofi Awoonor (Ghana), Ngugi (Kenya), Jack Mapanje (Malawi) Mongani Wally Serote (SA) among others.At least Soyinka\u2019s incarceration resulted in this extraordinary book, a work so brilliant that it necessarily invites all sorts of superlatives. The full range of Soyinka\u2019s literary talent and nous is explored in this work, with his patent intellectualism augmenting this memoir \u2013 a memoir that one can read over and over again with multiple rewards. Soyinka never hides his disgust and disdain for certain tendencies and personalities, and there are many instances here,perhaps including the \u201cdamned casuistic functionaire\u201d. The author\u2019s innate imagination and creativity is \u201cgathered, stirred, skimmed and sieved\u201d (to purloin his own expression here) during his travails behind the bars.Soyinka has always been a cerebral, metaphorical poet and legions of pertinent examples abound in this work. Memorably, the hapless soul who emits \u201cporcine sounds\u201d whilst cleansing his throat/expectorating early every day: regurgitating mortar and slag and dung plaster...do you?\u201d",
            "The thing that sticks in my mind most about this book is this: In solitary confinement, living with the knowledge that he could be summarily executed at any moment, preserving his sanity by writing his thoughts down on toilet paper with homemade pens and ink, he devotes something like three typewritten pages to how much he hates oranges. This is totally peripheral to what is undoubtedly a great book, but that's what sticks in my mind. I definitely need to read more of his writing.",
            "In the beginning there was Void. Nothing. And how does the mind grasp it? A waste? Desolation? Nothing is cheaply within grasp from what was. But as the fundamental nought, the positive, original nil? As the immeasurable drop into pre-though, pre-existence, pre-essence? But then, the mind that will conceive this must empty inwards from a lifetime's frame of accumulated references, must plunge from the physical platform into the primordial abyss. Within which alas, lie the creative energies which 'abhor a vacuum' even more than Nature. The cycle must commence again.Still, there being nothing worse to do, Pluto tried to discover tunnels even from the dead netherworld into deeper bowels of Void. at the best, it was mesmeric: the mind's normal functioning seized up, the day eased out in a gentle catalepsis. At worst it lay within the darkest ring of recreative energies, revolving on its axis, turning on its spoor in the gossamer dust of infinity . . . Which existed and had always been--Life, that is, which God did say Let There Be. Why? For it had always been within his protean mind, within form that was not formed, motion that did not move, time and space which existed not, yet were all severally and wholly contained, rolled and moulded within that great amorphous origin, pulse, breath, androgynous source of matter and of essence. Until, suffering, I do not seek, I find--he delved within and ordered: let there Be! Tangibly, visibly, olfactorily, audibly . . . What, then, what was this need to materialize in poor second-mould copy such merely outward manifestations of the pure Idea! Why break the invisible chrysalis of essense, the one unassailable Truth. Truth, because there was no copy, no duplicate, no faulted cast, not even a bare projection from an alien mind of that pure idea? For there were no other minds. No faker. What was this need to turn materialist? Uncertainty? Ego? Narcissism? Reassurance? Loneliness, said the Holy Wrist. A fear that thought was Nothing, and a fear of Nothing which could only be allayed by the thought made manifest. When at first the pigeons came, Pluto held their arabesques of wing-bolts high in the air, burning as incandescent tracers long after their creators had departed. Yet, fearful for when the seasons might change and the pigeons migrate and come no more he moved at once to wean the mind from dependence on such fortuitous aesthetics. A stone lay on the ground, worn smooth and oval shaped, subtly creviced as if by human hands, faintly reminiscent of a shuttle. Inert, yet he imbued it with the tapestry of fates, of seasons, pierced to the core and crowded its infinite lethargy with infinite creativity, coming away from that stone with only its pure luminous essence. For finally the loops and arcs of the pigeons did disintegrate, the quicker for being witnessed being only an activity in Time. The feather designs did crumble and lose their formal rhythms, falling back to earth in showering sparkles. And it rendered the Crypt darker than before. Not to create or think is best. The pauses leave the Crypt a little darker than before. Creation is an admission of great loneliness. Turn the mind in a loom of cobwebs, rest the time-smoothed shuttle in its home of timelessness. I need nothing. I seek nothing. I desire nothing. Not even loneliness. A mess known as the world was created to cheat loneliness and the one pure essence. So witnesseth the Holy Writ, faking it a virtue.*the sunflowers that grew outside of his window. Collecting the pollen to make a bar of gold.*inventing mathematical formulas/mobiles/wind tunnel.*the story behind the man died . . . I denied recognition even to the presence of women in the streets as we drove through, denied that my body had made physical breach of the prison walls. Submitting at last to public pressure in this one respect, the graceless men might seek revenge in other ways for the one surrender. My outing therefore remained an ambiguous omen. I refused to take pleasure in the sensation of breathing a less restricted air. Until the rains crashed through the barrier of insulation. An exhilarating storm, it penetrated all defences physical and mental, crushed the capsule to release the wild sweet scent of liberty. I gave into it, turning it to the strength of a thousand combative resolves that rushed out one after the other. Soaked to the skin, lashed by wind and rain as we fled through the long unprotected corridors of the hospital I was struck suddenly by the phenomena of these wild, free yet governed motions of the elements and us, and its contrast was that first death march into an artificial tomb. And, with the gaunt figure of Polyphemus racing far ahead of us, clutching his robes to him in a losing battle with the wind, I experienced a conviction as sharp and certain as the pessimist intuition of the turn of the year only, this time, in a positive revelation. It had to do with liberty but not with the gaining of it. It was a passionate affirmation of the free spirit, a knowledge that because of this love, my adversaries had lost the conflict. That it did not matter in the end for how long they manouevred to keep my body behind walls, they would not, ultimately, escape the fate of the defeated. At the hands of all who are allied and committed to the unfettered principle of life. "

            "The STAR TREK novelverse thrives best whenever it is moving away from the classic series to do their own thing. STAR TREK: NEW FRONTIER, THE STARFLEET CORPS OF ENGINEERS, and the KLINGON EMPIRE series are good examples. Basically, if you can't exert your freedom on the characters then it's probably best to have ones in the same universe but where there's more room to develop them.The STARGAZER series has one major character in Captain Jean Luc Picard, 28 years old and probably played by Tom Hardy with a full head of hair rather than Patrick Stewart. He is the newly promoted captain of the Stargazer, that is already a ship on the rickety side. Having broken Kirk's record as the youngest starship captain ever, he's getting the cold shoulder from his fellow captains. Even worse, he's attracted the almost comical hatred of an Admiral that loathes him just because he was an appointee by the guy who held his position before. Which means Starfleet functions like Fox television executives.The rest of the crew is almost entirely composed of original characters or the people who showed up in the novel, REUNION also by the same authors. Some of them we know will be doomed according to that novel but it actually adds a bit of drama here as we don't know how that will shake out. Either way, Picard needs to shake out a mostly underperforming and unwanted crew that he's been assigned by bureaucratic malice as they go after an infamous pirate called The White Wolf. No, he's not Elric or Geralt.Overall, I really enjoyed this novel and am going to read the entirety of the Stargazer series as a result.",
            "This is definitely a solid start to a series (not entirely sure if it is the start as these books are quite confusingly structured) showing Jean-Luc Picard in his first command and the challenges that could come with being the youngest captain that the federation had seen. It did an okay job at setting up the main characters but seemed to struggle with keeping a point of view for too long as it would zip back and forth between characters so fast that you may get whiplash trying to keep up with it.The overarching villain of the book (&amp, series), McAteer seems like a very one-dimensional character and the only thing that we learn of him is that he dislikes Picard and wants to see him fail. the plot follows Jean-Luc Picard being given the seemingly impossible task of apprehending a notorious pirate to punish him when he fails to do so, I found this to be a fairly interesting setup and hoped that interest only grew as Picard made his way into the wolf's den, having to deal with nearly insurmountable obstacles and challenges to reach the pirate's hiding place and fight on their ground, and my interest grew even deeper when a federation ship attacked and defended the pirates. By the end of the book my excitement seemed to be misplaced as it turned out that this infamous pirate, who had been impossible to catch by one of the most advanced fleets in the galaxy was just somebody who wanted to protect a planet from bandits and had to adopt this frightening persona to do so and in the space of a single page, Picard decided to keep this charade up to protect the planet. All of intrigue seemed to be for naught. I hoped that the things that the story left nuggets of setup would not disappoint ",
            "Three stars always seems to be my go to for novels that good but nothing spectacular. This installment of the Stargazer series does great work at setting up characters and relationships but the plot takes some time To get moving and even when it gets exciting. The climax is over in a flash. That said I enjoyed the way this book was carried out and how it ended and I look forward to the next Stargazer novel.",
            "This book was far different from what I thought it was going to be. Turns out reading about the Picard we all know and love as this self-doubter was not a brilliant plan, but I understand the premise. Also watching some of the upper echelons of Starfleet not acting in the best interest of the fleet was surprising. The clmax was over a little quickly, and there was next to no resolution.",
            "Wow, okay so this is my first Star Trek novel, the first good thing I can say about it is that it is short at 266 pages. Other good things include the writing for Picard, and the scene when the crew is navigating around the space votexs.Now for the not so good, the writing is generally kinda flat, there are way too many characters that thrown at you in the span of one chapter, and nobody gets a lot of development because of how short the book is. Besides Obal and Jiterica\u2019s plots nothing any of the side characters do ends up really mattering. (Looking at you Greyhorse, whose feelings for one of the sisters goes nowhere after it\u2019s mention in the opening couple chapters.There is a huge lull in the plot leading to almost nothing really happening between like page 45ish and page 150ish. I had a rough time with this novel, that said, I\u2019m still going to read the next one, in the hope to see something better now that these characters are more established and hopefully the author feels more comfortable with them.

        "desc": "In early 1864, as the Confederate Army of Tennessee licked its wounds after being routed at the Battle of Chattanooga, Major-General Patrick Cleburne (the Stonewall of the West) proposed that the most courageous of our slaves be trained as soldiers and that every slave in the South who shall remain true to the Confederacy in this war be freed. In ,Confederate Emancipation,, Bruce Levine looks closely at such Confederate plans to arm and free slaves. He shows that within a year of Cleburne's proposal, which was initially rejected out of hand, Jefferson Davis, Judah P. Benjamin, and Robert E. Lee had all reached the same conclusions. At that point, the idea was debated widely in newspapers and drawing rooms across the South, as more and more slaves fled to Union lines and fought in the ranks of the Union army. Eventually, the soldiers of Lee's army voted on the proposal, and the Confederate government actually enacted a version of it in March. The Army issued the necessary orders just two weeks before Appomattox, too late to affect the course of the war. Throughout the book, Levine captures the voices of blacks and whites, wealthy planters and poor farmers, soldiers and officers, and newspaper editors and politicians from all across the South. In the process, he sheds light on such hot-button topics as what the Confederacy was fighting for, whether black southerners were willing to fight in large numbers in defense of the South, and what this episode foretold about life and politics in the post-war South. , ,Confederate Emancipation, offers an engaging and illuminating account of a fascinating and politically charged idea, setting it firmly and vividly in the context of the Civil War and the part played in it by the issue of slavery and the actions of the slaves themselves.",

            "An informative, readable and well-researched if somewhat poorly edited history of Confederate emancipation that allows Cleburne and other Confederates to speak for themselves.In a thorough and well-written narrative Levine describes the context and origins of the Confederate debate, the main figures, and their motives. The most important motive of the proponents of emancipation was simply military necessity, given Confederate manpower shortages and how the idea was resisted by many Confederates, especially the planter class. These men were not enlightened abolitionists of any kind, they were simply willing to go to great lengths to ensure Confederate independence (and keep the majority of slaves in bondage while doing so)The \u201cemancipation,\u201d of course, was not a proposal to end slavery but a proposal to control it. Although poorly though out, the basic goal was to emancipate enough slaves to compensate the Confederacy\u2019s manpower shortages. If this allowed the Confederacy to somehow win the war, of course, the majority of slaves would still be kept in bondage. While there were some proponents of complete abolition, they were decidedly a minority.Levine describes how many Confederates were willing to send their sons off to war but were unwilling to do the same for their slaves. Such figures as Robert E. Lee and Judah Benjamin and, of course, Patrick Cleburne were proponents of the idea. When the Confederates did come around to enlisting blacks, the effort was halfhearted at best, and resistance to the measure was always strong. Many slaves also doubted the sincerity of those who were promising freedom. When blacks did enlist, they eagerly surrendered to Union lines rather than fight. Levine also disputes the idea that Davis or even Lee were hostile to slavery in principle: they certainly did not eagerly await its early demise.There are only a few problems. Levine\u2019s constant references to the \u201cCleburne-Davis\u201d proposal do not always emphasize the differences between the two men\u2019s views, and Levine writes that if the Confederates somehow won the blacks who enlisted would receive a \u201cminimal amount of personal liberty,\u201d without ever expanding on what he means. The grammar is quite shoddy in places. And according to Levine the US secretary of war was one Henry M. Stanton and George Thomas defeated Joe Johnston at Franklin and Nashville (huh?)A balanced, readable and well-organized work."

            "My Summer APUSH ReviewNote: I didn\u2019t read the whole book, but read enough to get a good feel for the author\u2019s writing style, way of presenting information, credibility, and thoroughness in examining various viewpoints.What was the real purpose of the Civil War? Honestly, though? Many Southerners seemed to think it was to preserve slavery, but others started to rush for higher, mightier reasons to frame their last attempt at victory, namely the emancipation of the slaves in return for military service, as supportive of, not contradictory to, the purpose they had been fighting the war for all these years.In the Confederate Emancipation, Bruce Levine examines many parties\u2019 point of view through use of selections from primary documents as to the reason the slaves were emancipated for the war effort, how different social classes viewed the policy, and how this undermined traditional views on racial equality in the United States. He also demonstrates why the emancipate-arm policy failed to win the war for the South.Was the war truly a result of the division of the United States into two hostile, internally uniform camps? Not exactly, Levine shows. He takes a step further than some other examinations of the war by bringing to light the diverse ideologies of people within the South itself about slavery and the purpose of the war they were fighting for, and how the lack of uniformity in purpose caused the once-powerful South to collapse in battle and principle. This helped the author dig even deeper into the issue of the people\u2019s point of view of the emancipate-and-arm policy the South put into practice (a new policy for me) and why it failed to turn the war\u2019s progress around.At the beginning of the war, Southerners in general were fighting for their right to maintain slavery, which was the primary reason for the South\u2019s prosperity due to a climate conducive to plantations. However, this type of agriculture needed a big labor force to keep it up, so, slaves were brought in from Africa, and the Americans created elaborate racial justifications to use humans as forced laborers, essentially putting white men on a pedestal and Africans as their inferiors. They even went so far as to argue that there were benefits for the slaves themselves, thinking of the masters as spiritual/moral guides, almost mini-gods that would guide their flock, in a way. However, as the Union started adding previous slaves-turned-refugees to their army, already bigger than that of the South, and made its way further and further into Southern territory with sound military victories, the Southern generals started to worry. Levine demonstrates the deteriorating confidence of the military authorities with references to personal letters and conflicting political presentations, despite their outward display of high spirits and morale, and how that pushed the highest leaders to adopt a new outlook on the previously shunned emancipate-and-arm policy as a way to win the war, and even on the war\u2019s purpose itself as at least saving the South\u2019s liberty (which they claimed \u201chad been\u201d the original cause of the war), even at the expense of their beloved slavery. However, the common soldiers that were actually fighting the war were opposed to fighting side by side with slaves, which would go against their deeply ingrained racial beliefs. It also contradicted what they believed they had been fighting and dying for all these years, which created even more discontent with the new policy. This led many troops to reject it, resulting in random application of the policy at best, which didn\u2019t allow a significant enough difference to be made to change the tide of the war.Levine also veers from the discussion of the differences among the Southerners to include the slaves\u2019 perspective on the slave-master relationship, which had long differed from what the slave-owners had believed it to be. His thoroughness in examining all viewpoints helped me gain perspective on the inside forces at work during the war, such as that of the slaves, which isn\u2019t as frequently documented as the published speeches of military and political officials tend to be in my experience. The slaves had long been discreetly keeping their general hatred of slavery to themselves, which led the slave-owners to \u201cconfirm\u201d to themselves their previous notion that the slaves were attached to their masters out of the great loyalty and gratitude they supposedly had for them. However, when slaves started escaping north for protection and freedom after the Emancipation Proclamation was put into effect by Lincoln, the haze the slave-owners had been living in started to dissolve. Levine shows through frequent quotes by the land-owners and slaves how the masters came to realize that the slaves prized freedom, not slavery, and military officials finally understood that the only way they would convince the slaves to join their armies, which were greatly outnumbered by the North\u2019s, was to offer them the same thing the North did, their freedom. However, Levine goes on to show that their epiphany as to the slaves\u2019 real feelings dawned on the South too late in the war to create a strong enough effect. Levine shows through quotes from previous slaves that they had long realized the difference between their masters and the North through communication \u201cvines,\u201d and they wanted to fight for their general liberty, not the slavery of their families and fellow slaves for their own liberty. The slaves also proved their racial equality to their former masters when they were recruited by the Northern military. They fought as well as, if not better in some cases, as their white peers, and caused even Southern military officers to admit their ability to fight extremely well, something they had denied the possibility of in the past.Levine thoroughly examines the issue of the emancipation of slaves with frequent reference to primary sources, including quotes from soldiers, generals, land-owners and their wives, and even slaves from the Civil War era. His writing style however, while not as dry as a textbook, is somewhat dense with his numerous/sometimes redundant quotes. I realize he wants to securely back up his claims, but he strays so far away from paraphrasing that the book starts to become a collection of quotes categorized in an outline ordered by topic. This format also lent to the somewhat confusing presentation of the author\u2019s argument in this book. While I learned a lot and was well-convinced of his credibility and fair presentation of most of the views involved, the choice of topic-based, over chronologically ordered, made a mess of things before it cleared them up in the next chapter. I often ended up realizing something was more obvious once I was introduced to another important aspect in a chapter when the situation had been a tangle of different opinions from various newspapers and parties before in the previous chapter. Overall, though, this was an informative and insightful book, even for someone not very familiar with the era, and worth the read for some perspective on the Southern people and their mindset/beliefs during the Civil War era.",
            "Great read to dispel the common myth perpetuated by southerners, that emancipation was favored by many southerners. By delving into the viewpoints of reluctant politicians and stubborn planters, Levine shows the failure of a necessary southern emancipation (it would have turned the tides of war) against the monetary interests and social stratum of southern society. Levine could be more concise with his verbiage, but the overall message was effective.",
            "This book discusses numerous struggles: The Confederacy's fight against the Union, African Americans' fight to achieve emancipation from chattel slavery, the Old South's fight with democracy, and the modern war over what to do with the proof that wealthy slave owners had complete control over southern politics. Levine proves these strands of history are so intimately linked that breaking one would require the telling of a different story. ",
            "This book is an able and frank study of the Confederate wartime emancipation debate. As such, it punctures a several popular myths along the way. For example, if most people are aware of the Confederate emancipation debate, they think it was a last desperate gasp at the end, but it wasn't. Far-sighted prominent army officers and politicians were arguing for the freeing and enlistment of blacks from the very beginnings of the war. It's just the the opposition to the measure was fierce, widespread, cut across all social and class lines, and was ultimately impossible to overcome. Many such minor bits of conventional wisdom are debunked, all of it with vast piles of evidence.The main service the book does is to connect what Southern arm the slaves proponents envisioned for the future of an independent South with what actually happened in the American South: namely, an evolution into a Jim Crow or even an outright apartheid state. This connects the wartime intentions of some within the Confederacy to the Jim Crow regime that Southerners actually gradually constructed and vigorously maintained between the 1880s and the 1950s. It's all one continuous train, briefly interrupted by Reconstruction and brought to an end only by the Civil Rights Movement.The book is not without its warts. I found the copy editing to be a little sloppy (in the Kindle version anyway), but not to the point of distraction. At a few points the book was repetitive, but overall the message was clear and powerfully delivered. Although not perfect, it is still a great book. Don't let the haters fool you into thinking otherwise, since the proof is right here that 90% of them haven't even read the thing. "

            "6th book for 2016.I have heard great things about Quammen over the years. I have had The Song of the Dodo: Island Biogeography in an Age of Extinctions on my to-do reading list for at least ten years now so was excited to read this (third) collection of Quammen's writings for Outside magazine. Unfortunately, the book is disappointing for a number of reasons. There is no strong thematic thread tying the short essays together, apart from the (somewhat) dubious framing that they are to do with human's interaction/reactions to the natural world. So we have essays for anything from phobias of spiders and snakes, to eating durian or flying foxes (two separate essays) to sitting in the garden looking for dark matter. As all of the essays are by nature shallow/quick magazine pieces, we are left with a lot of quick, seemingly random, jumping around over a wide range of topics.The stories from this collection date from the late 1980s and early 1990s, and are showing their age. Many of the essays give short introductions to what would have been interesting new ideas. However, the better ideas in this volume (life around volcanic vents, dark matter, birds as surviving dinosaurs etc) have all been developed and enriched over the years to the point that there is little of value in reading this short magazine pieces from a quarter century ago. On top of this I found Quammen's style annoying. His attempts to be cute and personable with his writing just ended up annoying me after a while. But once you remove his style from the equation you are left only with relatively shallow, outdated stories, with much of the science either wrong or better told elsewhere.It's hard to avoid the impression that even when the book was originally published that this was largely a money making exercise, with Quammen and the publisher cashing in on previous successes.",

            "Something reminded me of this book today. There is one question I've always wanted answered: What size penis did Tyrannosaurus Rex have? What about a Diplodocus? How did they mate? How on earth could a male Diplo get up on a female one if that's what they did, wouldn't he have crushed her to death? In fact what were the mating rituals of dinosaurs in general and did they come into season or just have sex whenever they felt like it? What did the males do to get the females in the mood if so?Tortoises are descendants of dinosaurs. I was in Ankara, Turkey, once, at the mausoleum of Ataturk, (one of my heroes) and saw a male tortoise pursuing a female one. She was running at hare-like speed but every now and again would look over her shoulder to make sure he was quite close. Then she would allow herself to be caught and they would go at it with the male having his head extended and panting. Until she would slide from under and run away again. We watched this for more than half an hour. I had never realised that tortoises had such enjoyable sex lives until then. But dinosaurs were too big and heavy for that model too.So how did dinosaurs do it? ",
            "September 2010No doubt you\u2019ve often asked yourself, over the years, why it is that owls don\u2019t have penises.(From \u201cSpatula Theory: The Continuation of Courtship by Other Means,\u201d p. 83) Actually, no. I always wondered about dinosaurs. Did they have penises? How big? How violent and raucous was dinosaur sex? Is that why Noah wouldn\u2019t let them on the ark?David Quammen doesn't answer that. He doesn't really know the mystery of the dickless owls, either. But sometimes the questions, and the thoughts they provoke, are more important than the answers anyway. This book, a collection of essays from Natural Acts, an eclectic just-barely-nature-related monthly column Quammen wrote for Outside magazine from 1981 to 1996, asks some of the questions nobody else wants to ask about animals and nature, and occasionally answers them in strange and very roundabout ways. From rattlesnakes and those who love them (and those who hate them), to tropical diseases, to lizards and other non-gorilla-related biology research projects, empires built on nutmeg and destroyed by pigeon poop, gay (and interspecies) sex among octopuses (octopi?) and the media frenzy from the resulting videos, fossils, beetles, cats, why we eat chicken eggs but not chicken sperm, dark matter, homo sapiens and our habit of distancing ourselves from our ape cousins (...a chimpanzee, confronting its own reflected image, is capable of self-recognition. But humans look in the mirror and see only God.), why we care more about dolphins than tuna, and plenty more. This is nature in the eye of the beholder--the world as we see it, as we react to it, as we fear and imagine and interpret and change it, all wrapped up into twenty-five quirky bite-sized essays. As others have said, this collection is bit disjointed, but entertaining nonetheless.",
            "My 2010 booklog notes these were old magazine columns, most good. But I would refer prospective readers to Radiantflux's later, more complete and more critical review: https://www.goodreads.com/review/show...",
            "We have friends whom we don't see often, but I always leave their house after a dinner together with something interesting to read. When I thanked them for being so generous with good books and recommendations they answered, We like lending books to you because you always return them--unlike many people we know. Well, under that kind of pressure to uphold my sterling reputation, I read this book immediately rather than adding it to the stack so that I wouldn't forget I had it.This book is a compilation of Nature Matters essays by David Quammen which previously appeared in Outside magazine. When he took the job as monthly columnist, his editor's only requirement was that each essay, no matter how abberant, should contain at least passing mention of an animal, a scientist or a tree. Needless to say, this left an amazingly wide range of topics from which to choose--and to say that these essays cover an amazingly wide range of topics is an egregious understatement. He waxes eloquent on everything from timing lizard races, to eating fruit bats, to poets (who write about birds, thus meeting the aforementioned requirement) to slime mold, to Thoreau, to tuna fishing, to homosexual octopuses (pi?), to suburban lawns and a myriad of fascinating scientists, places, creatures and phenomena in between.Reading these essays is a bit like surfing the Internet. One interesting fact links to something else until one wonders, How did I get *here* from *there*? This is not exactly light reading although the author is quite witty and sometimes laugh-out-loud funny. He brings up many thought provoking--even moral--issues particularly concerning our relationship to and exploitation of animals and natural resources. But it's not as though he has an agenda to prosthelytize but rather to fairly present both sides of an issue and let the reader decide.These essays offer an intellectual pursuit that is well worth the effort.",
            "Quammen's writing always calls the word 'muscular' to my mind: he wrestles and bends every topic into a well-formed story, full of research but delivering its information in a way that is entertaining and purposeful. His essays, meticulously but unobtrusively structured, don't just stop, they CULMINATE, ending at the exact moment when they have made their point.This volume is one of several collections of his natural history essays for the 'Outsider' magazine. The subtitle indicates a subliminal theme in this selection, of how humans view nature, but basically it's more Quammen, which is all it needs to be. Some topics covered in the 25 essays here: Thoreau, rattlesnake roundups, penis size, tropical diseases, top speeds of lizards, Durer's depiction of the rhinocerous and the stinkiest fruit in the world. If you wonder how the author managed to pull one of these fascinating stories out of the hat each month, his essay The Dope On Eggs spoofs his own working methods, depicting him desperately trying to find a story in a welter of eggy facts, and of course making a story out of the search.This points to one of the great pleasures of his writing, the humour. Fruitbats are a native delicacy in Guam, explains the grocer:He told me that outsiders sometimes set up a bat stand just down the road from his place, beside the fish stands. Couple of sawhorses and a big umbrella, they were in business. I refrained from asking him, Sort of a fly-by-night operation?In an essay on the terminal velocity of cats:What were the mortal limits of Felis catus in free fall? To explore that question experimentally would be moronic as well as heartless - and scientists hate to seem moronic.These articles are colourful, fact-packed, pointed, funny and incredibly engaging. What's not to like?",
            "Subtitle: Nature in the Eye of the Beholder.Nature writers can be divided into two groups. The first is the type who came at it from the science angle, and then learns to adapt to slogging through the wilderness in search of a story. The second is the type who came at it from the nature angle, and then learns to adapt to slogging through the science in search of a story. In either case, how good they are at their job depends in large part on how well they adapt to the part they learned second (well, that and how well they can actually write). Quammen appears to be one of the second type. If I were a nature writer, I would be of the first type. Nonetheless, Quammen has become my favorite science and nature writer, and the essays in this book are a good example of why.Quammen had a monthly column for Outside magazine, and this book has essays going back to 1981, but sampled from the fifteen year period during which he wrote that column. Quammen is not above beginning an essay with a line like No doubt you've often asked yourself, over the years, why it is that owls don't have penises. He is also capable of tracking down the world's academic expert on whatever topic is at hand, and following him (or occasionally her) into the lab, or the heart of the jungle or the tundra, and finding a way to explain the essence of their work more cogently than they can themselves.Which, it should be noted, is why we need more people like Quammen. We need the expertise that specialists can bring us, but the very immersion that is required to be an expert also makes it difficult for them to know how to explain their work to us. We also need writers like Quammen to grant us the perspective on the history of science that tells us about the rhinoceros that arrived in Lisbon, Portugal in 1515, a gift from a Sultan in India. The Portugese King sent it to the Pope, but it died en route, and was eventually made (post mortem) into a subject of an ink drawing, and eventually a woodcut, by Albrecht Duerer.Quammen helps us to imagine the rhino, bewildered by the last year of its life in a way we cannot help but sympathize with. He not only tells us about how Duerer's description of the rhino (fast, cunning, and daring) seemed pretty far from the truth, but he puts himself (and us) into Duerer's shoes to think why it might have been that way (hint: woodcuts were the best media at the time for mass marketing). Then he helps us draw what lessons we can for evaluating our own century's nature writing.This is, really, the challenge of our age. We have plenty of information, with an army of experts unearthing more all the time. What we have a shortage of is the ability to make some sense of it, neither ignoring the detail nor drowning in it. Quammen is a writer who can do this, and we are lucky to have him."

            "Pro Se Press is a relatively new small press devoted to the tradition of pulp fiction, as exemplified by the U.S. magazines in the earlier part of the 20th century. Through their Pulp Obscura imprint, they rescue older classic stories from undeserved obscurity, and they're a venue for contemporary New Pulp authors, who seek to keep the tradition and its spirit alive. Founding editor Tommy Hancock created the costumed character of the Pulptress as a role for a model to play in representing Pro Se at pulp conventions and other venues (debuting with great success at the first Pulp Ark convention in 2011). It wasn't long before the idea of using her as a fictional protagonist was born, hence, this first Pulptress story collection of five tales, written by Hancock and four other invited contributors from the Pro Se family.Our heroine is intentionally something of a mystery woman. As Hancock explains in the short introduction, she's the orphaned daughter of two pulp era heroes, though we're not told who (her real first name is Emily, but we don't know her last name). Fostered by a few other pulp heroes, both classic and New Pulp, who taught her a lot that's not usually covered in a typical education, she's now in her 20s. Like Pro Se Press, she's based in small-town Arkansas, but she travels wherever her mission leads her, and her mission is to help the innocent and take down the perpetrators of evil, working from outside the normal channels of law enforcement and with a variety of aliases. A mistress of disguise and possessed of gymnastic skills that are, I'd say, of Olympic quality, she's also smart, trained in martial arts, and no slouch with a firearm. While she's attractive, she's also described at various points as strong, and buff, with well-toned muscles --as the cover art indicates, those aren't antithetical ideas (it may not show in the thumbnail, but while she's not built like a weightlifter, the arm holding the pistol has a solid growth of muscle).A potential problem in this type of collection can be that the individual authors don't have enough common conception of the main character to make her seem like the same person from story to story. That's largely not a problem here: the Pulptress is recognizably herself from beginning to end, and all five writers draw her with an appealing, good-hearted and easily likeable personality, she cares about others, and she's got an obvious zest for the challenging and adventurous elements in what she does. Being adept at hand-to-hand (or foot-to-head, or fist-to-gut, etc. :-) ) fighting, her situation doesn't require her to use a gun, or lethal force, in all stories, and you get the impression that bringing her (human, at least) opponents in alive is her preference, but as Ron Fortier's Butcher's Festival indicates, she can also handle situations where that's not an option. (I didn't view that as a contradiction, just a flexible response to different circumstances.) A more noticeable contradiction is in the area of speaking style. Like the older pulp yarns that serve as models, none of these stories has a large amount of bad language (some have none), and all the writers here avoid obscenity or misuse of Divine names. But in some stories, our protagonist will cuss some, while in others she doesn't at all. Most people are more consistent in their speech than that, so it would be more realistic to let her be consistent as well. But this wasn't a major problem for me!The quality of the writing in all five stories is good, our authors each have their own style, but they all use description well and bring characters and settings to vivid life. (Andrea Judy's evocation of the catacombs under the city of Paris is especially memorable, if she hasn't actually been there, her research was exceptionally good.) The action scenes are (for pulp) realistic, in that we don't have protracted fights between two combatants who absorb punishment well beyond human capacity and keep fighting, here, a knock-out blow to the head will do what that kind of blow actually does. Emily's not Super Girl, either, she can be pushed to her absolute physical limit at times, and she doesn't disdain help or rescue when it's needed. An interesting feature of the stories is that they sometimes employ other series characters, whose paths cross the Pulptress' to give her a helping hand: Derrick Ferguson's Dillon, a black man whose race is underrepresented among pulp heroic figures (used by Hancock in Black Mask, Big City), Erwin K. Roberts' The Voice, and Fortier's Brother Bones. Obviously, prior knowledge of these characters would enhance those stories, but it isn't required, I hadn't encountered any of them before. (If you haven't, these tales may whet your interest --I'd definitely like to read more Brother Bones stories!) Given my liking for the supernatural in fiction, it was an added plus to find that the menaces in two stories are supernatural, and another has a definitely supernatural important character.Arguably, I hand out too many five-star ratings, but I loved these stories, and didn't really see any serious downside here (though you'll find the occasional minor typo or editorial snafu). If pulp action adventure is your thing, what with no sex, tasteful handling of violence (nothing gratuitous or over-stressed), a conflict of good and evil that you know in your gut the bad guys don't have a prayer of winning, and a heroine you can respect and admire, you can't go wrong with this one!",
            "When I met Tommy Hancock at MidSouthCon, he introduced me to his brand of New Pulp with Pro Se. I was ecstatic! I grew up listening to cassette recordings of old pulp radio shows while trying to find as many copies of those stories as possible. With the introduction of this fine folio, Pro Se has created an original, iconic character that is well-developed by a series of the authors contributing to this anthology. Each tale in it serves to highlight another facet of the gem known as The Pulptress, and I hope to read more about her in future editions.",
            "This collection of five short stories by five different authors serves as a good introduction to the character known as The Pulptress. She is an interesting character, a likable hero with a true sense of justice that drives her. While she is certainly a capable fighter and a smart tactician, she is not invulnerable so the action always has realistic consequences. I chose to read these stories between novels (as I often do with short stories) so as to stretch out the experience and keep them fresh.I found all five stories to be fun reads even though the styles varied quite a bit from one to the next. Some were quite \u201cpulpy\u201d such as the first story, written by Tommy Hancock, the editor of this volume as well as the force behind Pro Se Productions. Others were written in a more traditional adventure story-telling style. Despite being stories from different authors, I didn\u2019t find any glaring inconsistencies with The Pulptress\u2019s personality or methods. Several of the stories did involve other main characters or heroes that seemed like they could well be that author\u2019s main hero creation and they perhaps adapted an existing story to become a Pulptress story. Doesn\u2019t matter. Fun reading all the same.",
            "OK stories, but invest in an editor. Too many grammatical errors and typos to make it an enjoyable read.",
            " The Pulptress is a collection of five short stories revolving around a pulp heroine entitled The Pulptress, with an illuminating introduction by Tommy Hancock. While it is definitely possible to breeze through these stories in the course of just an afternoon, I would suggest if you pick of these stories to indulge in one or two and then let it rest for a little before picking it back up for the next tale. But anyway, let's start with the positives. This is a fun read. Focusing far more on action than thematics and meaning, The Pulptress showcases what I would argue is the best point of the genre. It doesn't take itself seriously, and none of these stories has any fear of going over the top. You've got ninjas and bad guys in lavender suits and domino masks. It's a touch ridiculous and more fun than most of the books I've got in my collection. Another great point about this set is that each story is a different author's take on The Pulptress. I enjoyed getting to jump around in her history and see what points every author seemed to agree upon as central to her character, and which were important just at that point.  There are some issues with the collection, though. The quality of the stories is not solid across the board. Butcher's Festival, while bringing some interesting characters out to play, stands out as a particularly weak, especially when compared to what I would call the gem of this book, The Bone Queen by Andrea Judy. As well, there were some significant spelling errors that yanked me from the narrative, such as mixing up 'heel' and 'heal.' As well, some of the stories relied on allusions to other events and names in pulp history. While this isn't bad on its own, I was a little sad to have to look up what was meant rather than pick it up from context to safe to check out the references on my own time.  Quality wise, I'd put this around a 3.5 out of 5. The stories vary from 'fun but needs serious work' to 'I would buy a book of just this one story oh goodness,' and as mentioned, a few errors slipped past the proofreaders. However, this collection was just too much darn fun to leave at a three star. If you're looking for a fun read to pick up and down, or an enjoyable way to spend an afternoon, definitely pick this up. ",
            "This was a good anthology, but not a great one. Some of the stories were good, some not so good. However, the character - The Pulptress - is excellent and a great addition to the New Pulp world. I liked the mystery of her background that is slowly revealed throughout the stories. I wanted to read more of these stories to get more of her back story. She's been trained by many others, including my favorite New Pulp hero, Dillon, but we still don't know a lot about her. And despite the uneven quality of the various stories, they all had two things in common: the Pulptress was in them and they make the reader want to read more stories like these.",
            "This chapbook introduces a kick-ass pulp heroine called The Pulptress. I enjoyed the high-energy, action-packed so much I immediately contacted the publisher and told him I wanted to submit a story for the next Pulptress collection. I believe that collection is due out early in 2016 and I am proud to be a part of it. In the meantime, The Pulptress is a very enjoyable read and every story is a winner."

            "One of the huge number of Westerns written by L'Amour. It contains all of the elements you expect of the genre: bad guys with a heart of gold, lawmen who aren't entirely sure that the law is the best way to achieve justice, cowboys, Indians, gunfights and desserts. But as usual, L'Amour uses these stereotypical elements of the genre to tell a deeper story.At its core, Catlow is about honor and friendship. Catlow is an outlaw--but with a dream of going straight, getting married, and settling down. Ben is an old acquaintance, friend, but also the US Marshal responsible for enforcing the law and arresting the criminals, of which Catlow is the most notorious.When the Marshal learns that Catlow has planned one last, huge, crime before he retires, he feels bound to stop him, or capture him. Yet time after time, he is faced with situations where to perform his sworn duty to arrest Catlow would be morally wrong--for example, he has a chance to arrest Catlow right after Catlow saves his life.In the end, this is a book about two men who have deep respect for each other's morality, with a mutual understanding that while the law (or duty) and justice often overlap, sometimes they don't...and anyone who wants to live a moral life has to figure out what to do in those situations where justice and the law diverge.",

Catlow is kind of sad that he might have to kill his best friend, particularly after saving his life three, four times in the past. Still, things get that way in the old west, and in old Mexico when the prize is a wagon train with more than a million dollars of Mexican gold.This is a quite painless 175 pages. It goes down easy like an Audie Murphy or Fred McMurray western. Nothing really awful happens to anyone who isn\u2019t a low darn varmint who\u2019s meaner than a rattlesnake.

            "This is one of those books where you get to a certain point and then you HAVE to finish it. The themes here are all familiar to fans of L'Amour, but it in no way did the familiarity detract from the story. Ben and Abijah (Catlow) are the friends we all hope to have and be to someone else. When Ben becomes a U.S. Marshal, of course he is going to have to track his old friend down someday. Descriptions are always one of the author's strengths, and here L'Amour gives us incredible pictures of not just the Southwest, but the country (and women) of Mexico in all their glory. Even more incredible is the description of the desert and its people that make you want to be there, even as it begins killing Catlow's men and nearly Ben as well.This is a definite must read for anyone who enjoys a good book, and not just fans of L'Amour or westerns in general. Find it! Buy it! Read it! Then keep it on your shelf so your friends and family can read it too. ",
            "Dear old dad (still alive), loved these Westerns when I was a kid.He loved the movies too, I am not sure how many times we watched For a few dollars more, A Fistfull of Dollars and The Good the bad and the ugly and similar movies.So imagine this portly bespectacled African academic who just loves reading stories about the The Old West. Interesting, hmm?I actually really enjoyed this one. The story is pretty basic but it's well told. Both the characters of Catlow and Cowan are very likable and I like that a good portion of the story takes place in Mexico.I was even more impressed when I realized that there is a MOVIE and that, LEONARD NIMOY, ONLY ONE OF MY FAVORITE PEOPLE IN THE WHOLE WIDE WORLD is in it! The movie probably isn't that good, but now I am tempted to watch it."

            "The author of this book is a talented writer and introspective \u2013 this is not a superficial travelogue. The book sparkles \u2013 and entertains. For the most part it is about his journey by bicycle across the United States as he approaches the age of sixty. This is currently my age \u2013 and I did some bicycling years ago in my younger days \u2013 so this book appealed to me from the outset.Page 114-15 (my book) \u2013 while cycling in MontanaThis may a good time for a disquisition on wind, which is, naturally, a huge factor on a trip like this, a thrilling friend when it\u2019s behind you, a wily foe otherwise, which feels most of the time...The psychological battle between a cross-country cyclist and the wind is more complicated than you would think. First of all, the wind isn\u2019t a singular force but a plethora of little forces that coalesce into a prevailing notion, though not without a number of contrary opinions. In other words, the wind is a million winds, most of them working more or less in concert but many not, so that no matter which direction is prevalent, you\u2019re being buffeted by a battalion of little dervishes.It\u2019s more than a bicycle journey narration which is where the author started losing me. It becomes an autobiography with rather long detours on the authors\u2019 parents, friends, lost and current lovers\u2019. I suppose I should have noted the sub-title more carefully \u2013 \u201cLove, Death\u201d. These digressions, to emphasize again, are well-written, but I found they interrupted from the main flow of the journey. And I also found them to be too personal (writer\u2019s angst) \u2013 an overflow of the author\u2019s personal life (i.e. love affairs that didn\u2019t work, friends from the past who died...). But I did love the bike journey!",
            "Not quite what I was expecting (in a good way). Author Bruce Webber mixes travelogue with ruminations on friends, family, significant others, and mortality as he rides from coast-to-coast for the second time (his first was in 1993). Recommended for cyclists and non-cyclists alike. ",
            "It took a while to get into his writing style (kind of dry and dude-ish) but I loved the clarity and honesty that he presented. The best parts are synopses of American life and his other travels he has taken by bike. The not-so-great parts, for me, were technical details about bikes and road logs. A book about traveling and self-discovery. Recommended for all adventurers, bike enthusiasts, and people that get why anyone would travel cross country in anything but a car. ",
            "Really enjoyed this travelogue of author Bruce Weber's bike ride across America. I believe that I'm an expert reader of this type of travel writing and this is one of the best. This is in my top three with Bill Bryson's A walk in the woods being number one, Life is a wheel is number 2 and The handsomest man in Cuba by Lynette Chiang as number 3.",
            "Having completed a cross country bike ride last summer, I can\u2019t seem to get enough of other accounts of the same adventure. Bruce Weber\u2019s Life is a Wheel did not disappoint. The same questions I encountered every day on the ride are the same ones I want to ask other riders and are the same ones the author answers adeptly, showing his mark as someone who writes for a living. These questions include: What motivated you to do this ride? What route are you taking? What do you think about while you ride? Does it hurt?Everyone has their own twist on the questions. Reading this book gives my own answers perspectives. I squirmed at some of the more open answers, while understanding that doing this ride is deeply personal, and writing about it would necessarily encompass a range of life experiences, some conventionally acceptable, others not so much.My favorite quotes from the book are those that ring the truest to me:\u201cHowever far you go, your achievement is measurable and unequivocal. You make an enormous effort, you worry about all sorts of things, you strain and sweat, you self-examine, self-aggrandize, and self-loathe, you exult, you despair, you exult again and despair again, but at the end of the day, at the end of the journey, you\u2019ve arrived at a destination or you haven\u2019t. What a relief from life\u2019s more common challenges - family, work, love - and their irreducible ambiguities.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m struck by the conflicting needs of a traveler: to soak up as much as you can and eventually to get where you\u2019re going.\u201d"

It may give him a big break and the chance to get financing for a film he wants. Ava is less than pleased to see him but when he offers her a great price for the estate and her services she can't refuse since she needs the money in the economy. Over the years Cade has repeatedly tried to apologize to Ava but she is not interested, she hasn't forgiven him but tells him let us keep the past in the past. Suffice to say Jane and Poppy are not happy but Ava says that she is a big girl now and she can handle him and she does, she is totally amazing and such a professional. Ava can multitask, she handles her father's birthday party, organizing for the entire production crew, you name it.I liked that Cade knew what a jerk he was and has suffered for that. He never gives up trying to make up for that and has changed from the guy he used to be. He was attracted to Ava even then but let his family events and need to be cool, hurt Ava. He respects her like hell for not taking what he doled out lying down and admires the person she has become.And the best part was that they didn't have the perfect sex experience back in high-school, most of the time in romance books the guy is a stud the first time around but Cade agrees his 18 year old self was less than stellar. It was good seeing how Ava had come to accept herself with the help of her friends, yes she was human and had doubts sometimes but she was kick-ass and knew how to get back at Cade. Man when she wears that knock-out dress just to get back at Cade for giving her sleepless nights and when she gets her friend to act as her boyfriend when Cade doubts her.Cade, I didn't expect to like him after what he did to Ava but I did. He was jerk back then and he worked to make up for it, even accepting the blame when Ava doesn't trust him. He had matured and even let Ava know that he found her perfect the way she is, which allows Ava to point-blank tell her mother to back off, that her body is the way it is. And the best part how Cade falls for her first and tries to convince Ava that is real.The sisterhood books were great and finally they found the Wolcott jewels. I loved the way the girls handled the guy who tried to make them hand over the jewels. Girl power rocks. The book is a great end to the series.Courtesy netgalley"

            "Third book in the series and just as engaging. Maybe it was because the girls are kinda normal... Ava has some issues from her childhood/teenage years. I can empathize - with two brothers you have to be kind of thick skinned and girls are very conscious about their weight when they are teenagers. At least I was ... especially when those fucking brothers used to call me Hippo!!!! All is forgiven now. we are good friends.",

I admit that I didn\u2019t notice that when I requested the book, and probably wouldn\u2019t have requested it if I had, because I simply don\u2019t \u201cdo\u201d chick-lit. However, I am incredibly glad that I didn\u2019t see the category before I requested it, because I would\u2019ve missed out on a real gem of a book!In short? I loved it! It was light while still dealing with life issues, steamy without being trashy, and sweet without being saccharine. Ava has never fully embraced her curves, despite the fact that she\u2019s worked hard to get and maintain her curvy figure of a fit size 12. Cade has never been able to fully make up to her for his cruel prank in high school. Throw in her work as a successful concierge, his skill as a producer/director of hit documentaries, a little intrigue about some missing diamonds, two friends who would walk through fire for our heroine, and some delicious chemistry, and you\u2019ve got a truly enjoyable read.Recommended for fans of realistically sized heroines, righting a wrong that\u2019s plagued you since high school, and having BFF\u2019s who stick with you through everything. A very enthusiastic 4/5 Stars ",
            "Let me get this straight.This book is good.I just dnf-ed this one because I was getting bored with the romance genre. This book is a total brain candy. It's fun, sexy, entertaining and if I wasn't fed up with blushes, butterflies in the stomachs and kisses, I would have totally finished this.But alas, life is a moody bitch. I'm now craving for some back stabbing, fist fights and blood.",
            "The whole point of reading this trope (boy done girl wrong and later regrets), is that he is man enough to grovel well.DNF at 50%Cade spends weeks pretending to be Ava's friend in high school in order to seduce her for a bet.He succeeds and she is publicly humiliated in the cafeteria. I did like her character as she gives as good as she gets, but HE KNEW WHAT HE DID TO HER. So she goes on a diet and becomes awesome looking the following year.Years later, he wants to make a docu-drama about her and her friends' mentor and the mystery of the woman's missing diamonds. Apparently the mystery of the diamonds isn't over...He's drawn to her but views his attraction as something like a bad rash that he can just get some cream for to eradicate.Well, he tries several times over the years to apologize, but he never puts any effort into it. It was more like something he seemed to want to get off his chest. (Get the guilt monkey off his back maybe?). There's absolutely no willingness to make a public gesture, and there's no sense of appreciation for her as a person. (except that he likes her awesome bod)In fact I quit reading half way because he almost does the same damn thing to her again!He doesn't want to get his fragile ego hurt, so he lets her believe the worst.This guy couldn't apologize his way out of a paper bag.But hey, I did quit half way, and maybe he redeems himself??? maybe.Maybe I'll go back and read the rest someday...",
            "Really enjoyed finally reading Ava's story. I enjoyed how she was such a strong person even though she had insecurities. I liked Cade. I especially liked that he had treated her so badly in high school but had not waited the 10 years until this book took place to apologize for his betrayal. He had tried many times over the years. It just took her this long to forgive him. This book was well written, light hearted without being farcical. It moved right along and all made sense. I really wanted to watch the documentary when they were done with it. Too bad it's make believe. ,-)A solid end to this enjoyable series.",
            "I give it 2 because I am generous, and because the part of bullying is not as badly taken as in others, but I have left me like 100 pages of: unnecessary descriptions of the clothes and the wonderful aspect of all, is that there was no one or normal, they were all out of a magazine.And the subject is secondary of jewelry, bullshit that does not add anything to history. Please, for the next one if the author wants to be a trial of truth and with a girl who is chubby - right - as a prota, that remembers that withOne size 12 is not, nor of a co\ufffda."

Love it. The whole idea of wishing for help from a mythical Goblin King only to find yourself his prisoner? Oh yeahhhhhh. So, while this book has nothing whatsoever to do with that movie, I admit that I was at first intrigued by the possibility of any parallels. Once I started reading, however, I quickly forgot about David Bowie\u2019s hair and instead found myself falling in love with not only the world that Ms. Husk has created, but with all of her goblins as well. The struggle of the men to go against their \u201cgoblin\u201d natures, the heartbreak of watching one of their own succumb and fully transform, and the hopelessness they faced as the clock quickly ticked down to the point where breaking the curse truly seemed to be an impossibility was a joy to read.While I admit that it was a little frustrating to see the same issues rehashed several times over the story, and my desire to smack some decisiveness into Eliza only grew over the course of the novel, overall, I absolutely adored it.5/5 Stars",
            "Heeding a summons, the Goblin King, finds his summoner unconscious, but seizes the chance to bring the woman back to his lair \u2013 and a goblin never gives up his treasures.Having read the free kindle prequel Summons: A Goblin King Prequel and being a fan of Labyrinth (yes, it has muppets but there is also a touch of forbidden romance) I was completely intrigued by the premise of Husk's series. Roan, the Goblin King, is a cursed warrior trying desperately to fight the greed that threatens to turn him fully Goblin, and after endless years of struggling he is on the cusp of losing that battle. The summons eighteen years ago (which is the story from the prequel) gave Roan hope - having his young summoner see him as a man and a hero instead of a monster, had helped him keep fighting.While I liked the prequel, I was glad that Husk gave the young summoner Eliza time to grow up before, bringing the pair back together again. The initial reunion between Roan and Elisa still had me a bit worried, because the monster in Roan wants to take what is 'his', but that ultimately just adds to the intensity of Roan's battle against his desire and makes the fact that he holds out and waits for Eliza instead of trying to take from her what must be freely given all that much more intense . So all in all, I really loved the anguished warrior king trying to hold onto his humanity and the woman who is able to love the whole man, even the monster he hasn't quite succumbed to yet. And I will be looking for more from Husk, the Goblin King is just the first in a trilogy and Roan's brother Dai take the lead in the next book, Kiss of the Goblin Prince.",
            "The prequel was ok, but not great. I should have listened to my gut and given this a miss. The heroine is too whiny for my taste, the hero is endlessly going on about almost being a goblin, but not yet and about saving his soul and so on and so forth. A lot of talking, not much action, not a lot of plot development. Very repetitive and the reasoning of the main characters did not make sense to me. I was bored and did not finish at about 30%.Edited review (original review from February 2013), as I just read it again and did not like how unkind I was in it.",
            "Review courtesy of All Things Urban FantasyI can\u2019t not immediately think of David Bowie and the movie Labyrinth when I see the title of the first book in Shona Husk\u2019s paranormal romance trilogy, THE GOBLIN KING. I always thought that movie was missing a romance and it was great fun to get to read a book that delivered a truly magical goblin/human love story. Why don\u2019t we see more goblins in paranormal romance? Oh, right, because they look like goblins. Not exactly ideal for making the heart go pitter pat. But Shona Husk\u2019s mythology handles this situation perfectly. In our world, goblins look a lot like Gollum from Lord of the Rings. But in their home in the Shadowlands, they look human. That is until they completely use up their human souls. After that it\u2019s full goblin mode all the time. Roan was an near perfect romantic hero. He\u2019s lived for millennia as The Goblin King, a human cursed with a golden heart and an all consuming desire for the shiny metal. His curse forces him to answer the summons of humans and grant wishes. But he\u2019s far from a complacent genie. He\u2019s crafty and merciless. His humanity all but gone. When Eliza summons him to escape an engagement she is trapped in, he snatches her from her world with every intention to enjoy her whether she wants to or not. It\u2019s only when he recognizes her as the little girl he saved and spend one perfect day with years ago (which you can read about in the free prequel ebook), that what\u2019s left of his humanity flickers back to life.There\u2019s a beautiful Beauty and the Beast quality to the romance in THE GOBLIN KING (with a super hot sensuality level) that I found completely enchanting. Eliza is forced to wrestle with her emotions where Roan is concerned and decide what\u2019s she\u2019s willing to give up to save him, if saving him is even possible. She\u2019s also got a serious situation back home with a blackmailing fianc\u00e9 and a family legacy caught in the balance. I really appreciated the separate yet complimentary stories that each character had apart from their romance. If, like me, you had a crush on The Goblin King from Labyrinth and always fall for the Beauty and the Beast type stories, you\u2019re going to love THE GOBLIN KING. Fresh mythology, wonderful character redemption, and the power of true love. This is exactly what paranormal romance fans crave. The next book in the Shadowlands trilogy will be published in May 2012, and is called KISS OF THE GOBLIN PRINCE. I\u2019m certainly ready to pucker up.Sexual Content:Several graphic sex scenes",
            "Goblin King by Shona HuskParanormal Romance - Oct 1st, 20114 starsRoan is the Goblin King. He and his surviving men were cursed by a vengeful Druid for a past misdeed that they could not control. As Roan loses his humanity, he becomescloser to becoming a full and vicious Goblin without morals or scruples but there is oneperson who can hold back the tide, if she dares. Eliza met the Goblin King, and he gave her one of his beads after saving her. She has been the only one in centuries who summoned him for his aid and actually thanked Roan him instead of reviling him. Eliza's belief in him as her savior gave Roan hope. But now a grown up Eliza is trouble again and summons her past savior to help her, he is different from the hero she remembers. Harder. For Roan has become less human and more goblin. She is scared of his ferocity and how he has changed. But can she see past what he has become to the man who is still within?This a gorgeous world the author has created. The villains in this story are pure evil and I couldn't wait for the hero and heroine to give them their just desserts. However, since both of the main characters have been so battered down by their enemies, they take quite a while to assert themselves which makes me quite frustrated early in the story. Most of Roan's men have succumbed to their goblin side and are now lost forever. I especially mourned the death of Roan's friend. I would love it if the author could find redemption for the poor warriors who have suffered and turned true goblin but I don't see how this would be possible. Much of the story delves on the hopelessness of returning Roan to humanity after many failures. This brings a lot of tension but also made me feel a bit depressed at times.A heartrending hero and a courageous heroine fight a terrible curse and find love. Those who love fairy-tale like romances should definitely try this book.Reviewed by Steph from the Bookaholics Romance Book Club"

And speaking of Hisoka... boy was that a weird (and brutal) fight he had with Kastro o.OInterested to see how the next volume will continue with this, seeing as this one ended with such a defeat...Notes below in spoiler tags, for reference:Chapter 45.I don\u2019t know how much the money in the Hunter x Hunter world is worth 8\u2019D What\u2019s 10 million? Is that equivalent to Yen? Dollar? What? ,u, Because if it\u2019s dollars that\u2019s\u2026 a lot\u2026 but if it\u2019s yen then approx. $100,000 give or take. Which is ittttt\u2026 --...He spent 200 million on snacks over four years. I really hope that was in yen ($2mil) rather than dollars. Still ridiculous either way though.--Oooh\u2026 The favourite for the bets is Zushi. That is NOT going to make Killua happy.--Wowie. Did not expect that guy to yell so damn loud o.O--Yay! Kil and Gon are going to go all the way to the top! I\u2019m excited to see what\u2019s up there, because after all\u2026 Kil gave up last time at 190, didn\u2019t he?Chapter 46. \u201dLearn Ten, know Zetsu, through Ren, to attain Hatsu. That\u2019s how you train for Nen!\u201dWell that means absolutely nothing to me. And apparently to Gon and Kil too XD--Oh good! It\u2019s being explained! I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll forget this soon sooo\u2026Ten (Point) = Focus the mind, reflect upon the self, and determine the goal.Zetsu (Tongue) = Put it into wordsRen (Temper) = Intensify your willHatsu (Release/) = Put it to action--WOWIE. The teacher guy putting this into action is INSANELY powerful. The sudden shift in the visual definitely shows how effective this is O.O--LOL. Kil is clinging to the ceiling after that.--So, the teacher mislead them because they weren\u2019t his real pupils, huh? Apparently he did so because it\u2019s too easily misused though, so fair.--They\u2019ve made it to the 200th floor!Chapter 47. HISOKA :O--And he doesn\u2019t want to let them in to the 200th floor? Does that mean he\u2019s going to go on a killing spree? It IS Hisoka\u2026--Teacher dude is back! And this time he\u2019s ACTUALLY teaching them. So Nen is actually the \u201cability to control, at will, the life energy, or \u201caura\u201d, that suffuses our bodies\u201d. Basically it\u2019s ki (from DBZ). That\u2019s easy to remember! :P--Yep. Definitely ki.Chapter 48. Huh. Seems more of a combination of chakra and ki, with the way that nen is described.--Wow. They\u2019re both prodigies with nen control, huh?--...well\u2026 facing Hisoka was anticlimactic :P But I suppose that he wants his true opponent after all, and seeing as they\u2019re so new to the idea of Nen, and he\u2019s apparently mastered it tool\u2026 he probably would see it as a waste for either of them to face him now, when they\u2019re so new to the concept.Chapter 49. LOL. So much for giving the benefits of the battle tower thingamajig. Gon and Kil are really not impressed.--Well. It\u2019s clear that Gon followed Wing\u2019s advice to not battle for two months\u2026 yep\u2026 certainly not battling the very next day or anything\u2026 he wouldn\u2019t do THAT\u2026--His opponent has spinning tops of doom. Wtf.Chapter 50. Not only does Gido (Gon\u2019s opponent) have multiple spinning tops of doom, apparently he can also turn himself into a giant spinning top. What.--He released (turned off) his ten? So that he could sense the spinning tops (as he couldn\u2019t while his ten was active)? o.O --Seems this tactic might actually work. Chapter 51. ...I don\u2019t think it DID work. Nevermind. He\u2019s now in a hospital.--I THINK I have it now\u2026 Ten = defensive, Nen = offensive. Right?--I love that Kil\u2019s whole reasoning for doing it is some money, and to accompany Gon while he trained to face off against Hisoka c:--What was that that was just hinted at while Gon and Kil were meditating? o.O--Kurapika!--Huh. So that\u2019s the final test to become a hunter.-- Who was Wing\u2019s master then?Chapter 52. All healed already? He definitely reminds me of Naruto XD Maybe this is his ability?--...Hisoka initiated Kastro? What limb did he lose :|--Okay. So he didn\u2019t lose an arm?--Kastro got the first hit! :oChapter 53. Is Kastro so fast that he causes an afterimage - like on DBZ?--\u201cTiger bite fist\u201d? No. That\u2019s the start of a kamehameha XD Was this guy friends with Goku? :P--KASTRO JUST RIPPED HISOKA\u2019S ARM OFF.--\u2026How does taking your arm back help exactly?--Okay. Not after-images. An actual double?--...why are you eating your own (now removed from your body) flesh?Chapter 54. How the heck? Kastro took Hisoka\u2019s left arm off\u2026 but his right arm has apparently grown right back? o.O--Well. Now Kastro\u2019s screwed. --HOW DID HE ATTACK KASTRO WITH THE ARM THAT IS SEPARATED FROM HIS BODY.--...Well. I think Kastro\u2019s dead.Through the cards. And apparently, the cause of his defeat was a so-called \u201cmemory overload\u201d (said by Hisoka) based on the fact that after learning to create a double, it was the only use of Nen he COULD do\u2026 thus leaving himself open to attack.

Really enjoyed this volume as it raises the stakes in the battle tower and explains new martial arts/spiritual techniques and offers a great insight to this world!

            "Man was this hard to get through. I don't know how I could be so enthral led by the last book, and so squirmy while reading this one. Reading this made me feel awkward so often, I thought I was back at a high school dance.Some of it is the dialogue, and while my complaints about bad dialogue are well-documented, I can't quite articulate what's wrong here for me. It just feels stiff and staged, like a small-town play can feel when the local pharmacist is going though the motions self-consciously. Too much first-person narration of what we already see on the page. Some of it is the poorly-inked art - can't help but feel flat like Saturday-morning manga.Somewhere along the way the weight of this book got misplaced - when the big reveals come along, somehow they feel small, liminal, ho-hum. The flashbacks feel forced, either as filler or overprescribed exposition in service of a readership they don't trust to go along with the weird storyline.When did Lemire lose his faith in the intelligence of his audience? If there's on thing Lemire's previous work wasn't, it wasn't pedantic. Or did editorial decide to start dictating a dumbed-down version? Didio and Lee sure convey their lack of faith in an intelligent readership every time they show some level of influence over the New 52. Am I interested in reading more Animal Man from Lemire? No - and especially after the boring melodramatic preview they padded into this book. Would I pick it up as part of the Rotworld crossover with Snyder's Swamp Thing? Possibly - let's see how ST 2 comes out.",
            "Grant Morrison is possibly the most inconsistent writer around, but he hit some serious home runs in his time. By far, Animal Man was the leader. I hated not seeing Buddy Baker used in regular continuity for so many years, though. Like Resurrection Man, I always felt like he was a seriously under-utilized character in the DCU. Jeff Lemire brought him back and removed the humor, the surrealism and the absurdist nature of the original series and injected it with the maximum amount of seriousness he possibly could. Oh, and horror. Lots of grotesquerie and horror. Looking back at the first few issues, at volume one, I think maybe we could have gotten a little bit of an introduction to the character, to the players. But Lemire dropped us right into it and ran away with it, and we had no choice but to keep up. I loved it, but this volume allows for a little more character development and I'm glad for that. Lemire obviously could let the Red/Green/Rot story run for years and years, just adding to this mythology- but fortunately it's coming to a close soon. I thought I'd lose patience with it, but seriously, Lemire is worldbuilding with Snyder and creating a little piece of Vertigo off in the corner of the DCU and creating a separate mythology away from the capes, and I'm so glad.Art- all of the pencils, the inks, just spot on gorgeous. Colors aren't as striking as I'd like, but the layouts and style are just gorgeous. Stylistically perfectly compatible with the story. Art: AWriting: A",
            "Ultimately, this volume feels like a bit of a non-event. In practical terms regarding the plot and building threat, essentially nothing of importance happens in this book. It's all just more and more exposition about what The Red is and how Animal Man and his daughter are connected to it, and, frankly, I get the point. I want this to move forward.The only real plot of this book involves Animal Man being transported yet again to The Red while his physical body is taken over by one of the evil agents of The Rot. It's a very slow odyssey through a realm we've already seen too much of, and the action cuts away from Buddy's physical body so often that we never have any idea what the Rot is up to. It's just taken over his body and... done nothing. Buddy's gone so long that the Rot could've done pretty much anything it wanted with his family, and yet it just kind of waited around for no reason until he showed up to punch it. Throw in a completely pointless cameo from John Constantine and the Justice League Dark and you've got a real time-waster of a volume here. Feels like Lemire's just stalling until he can crossover with Swamp Thing.Now, I'd be able to forgive this minimal plot development if there was a single character in this book I cared about. However, everyone is just a two-dimensional stock character with nothing new or interesting to offer. Buddy is just protecting his family. His son is an aloof teen. His daughter is creepy. His wife is a buzzkill and a nag. His mother-in-law is also a buzzkill and a nag (great job writing women, btw). There's nothing else discovered about any of these people, and the dialogue is flat to the point of being laughable.I'll also say this about the way people speak in this. I can't handle the nicknames. Buddy calls his daughter Little Wing every time he talks to her. Little Wing? So, just, a Jimi Hendrix song? It does not at all feel like a real nickname a father would give his daughter. It just feels like a way to work in animal imagery, and it bugs the living hell out of me. Then, when Buddy goes to the Red, there's a goat man there who keeps calling him Butter Baker. Constantly. Like, dude knows Buddy's name is Buddy. It just feels like Lemire scraping the bottom of the barrel for an iota of comedy in this story and then really leaning into it hard, and it just took me out of it every time he said it.So, unfortunately, this series just isn't doing it for me. I'm enjoying Swamp Thing, so I'll probably keep reading it for the crossover appeal, but with Travel Foreman's creepy art gone this series has little redeeming value. Oh well.",
            "The artwork stayed pretty consistent with the artwork of the first volume and the characterization and tone remained consistent as well. Where this volume lapses in comparison to the first is in concept.Lemire tries very hard to explain away all of the questionable aspects of the whole red/green/rot balance-of-nature scenario, and it kinda falls apart on him. There seems to be some grasping at straws going on. He tries to tie-in other characters from other titles, namely JLD, and you can see that the story is trying to build up to a major crossover with Swamp Thing.... Lemire even goes as far as making a major retcon alteration in the already established Animal Man origin story to help lend support to this new concept...and it just doesn't feel.... natural. He should have left it all conceptually wide-open instead of detailing an overly complicated mythos. At this stage in the story arch, I think readers simply wanted more forwarding action, and less explaining. Too much detail all at once feels Baroque, unnecessarily heavy. Such are the stakes with a high-concept series, though. It was the risk that Lemire was willing to take and in ways it is successful. I mean, there is not much out there to compare to the New 52 Animal Man. It truly stands alone. But it could still use some refinement going forward.Let's hope the script work tightens up a bit in the next volumes. Better dialogue would be nice, and not as much history lecturing. Focus on the core characters and what is happen in the now.3.5/5"

            "This surreal horror comic follows the fascinating premise of Animal Man, Vol. 1: The Hunt, with Buddy Baker trying to use his animal powers to protect his family from the forces of decay/rot/death, and the main story is still good. We get some creepy worldbuilding as Animal Man explores the realm of The Red (the force binding all animal life), and there's some good tension as different supporting characters find themselves in serious danger. We get some more insight into the balance of power among The Red, The Green, and The Rot, which makes sense and gives a valuable context to the events of the story. A guest appearance by some magical DC characters I don't know well was wasted on me, but it didn't derail things too much, so my only real problem with the main story is how shrill Buddy's wife and mother-in-law are. They're trying to protect their family just like Buddy is, sure, but they do it by complaining and grumbling and refusing to accept the state of the world around them, and I'm uncomfortable with how loathsome they are.Still, the main story is just fine. What makes me generally unimpressed about the volume as a collection, though, is how often the main story gets derailed. We get an annual dropped into the middle of the book, pulling the reader out of the action into a flashback tale of an earlier generation's version of this battle, and we end with an origin issue (which is fine, as it goes, and I gather that it's explaining the original character's origin in light of the New 52 reboot - I didn't need it, since I joined the game in the new version, but I can reconstruct what must have come before, and I appreciate the efforts to fold in old continuity). I realize that this must be the order in which the issues were published, but an edited collection should be able to skip chronology a bit in order to tell a more coherent story. The book as it exists just doesn't quite add up to the sum of its parts, and I'd like to follow the story, but I won't be nearly as excited for volume three as I was for volume two.",
            "In doing some catchup on DC Comics events (somehow they seem less mundane than Marvel's) I find myself enjoying a D list character such as Animal Man for the first time since Grant Morrison's arguably classic run. Wile not as meta fiction as Morrison's Lemire honors much of the work done by those who came before wile crafting his original take on Animal Man. I mean lets face it. Buddy Baker is a character that only could have been created during one of two time periods in American comics. Either the 1940s when everything was thrown against the wall to see what stuck, or the 1960s boom when every company was seeking to cash in on the Batman television show craze (see concepts such as Jigsaw and Super Green Beret as examples). So how do you make a man who mimics the abilities of the animals near him interesting?Start with making him a big time player. Buddy's role in the overall scheme of life is smaller than his daughter's Maxine's, and this is again emphasized in the first installment of his part in the Rotworld sage. While tossing aside some of the elemental avatar aspects of the DCU created by John Ostrander, Lemire builds on it by giving some back story to the Red, the Green and the Rot. Despite moving this title, Constantine (aka Hellblazer) and Swamp Thing from Vertigo back into the DCU this is a story that would have withstood the Vertigo test quite well I think.",
            "Good gravy. This is amazing. They even managed to reference Grant Morrison's run on the 1980s Animal Man title, and incorporate the aliens who gave Buddy his powers into their new mythology.The only complaints I have are the new version of Zatanna and Buddy's increasingly shrill and unreasonable wife -- dagnabbit, can't we have ONE story about a family impacted by the supernatural in which one of the parents doesn't wind up becoming intransigent and illogical?Otherwise, this volume was worth every penny and confirms my growing feeling that this is the only New 52 title worth reading."

            "It seems some cultures take poetry more seriously than others. When the Japanese people learned the writing system from the Chinese, one of the first books they produced was this giant anthology of poems (4500+ poems). Authors vary from emperors and courtiers to anonymous ordinary people. (The other thing they did was to write down the history: The Kojiki: Records of Ancient Matters) I've read the whole thing in Japanese, and to this day, can recite some of them by heart. It gives me a great comfort to know that there were people who felt the same way I do hundreds of years ago. By the way, I've also read some English poems, and while there are a few that are heartfelt and beautiful, most sound smart-ass to me. Perhaps the last part to me is critical, English is my second language, and if I've missed something, the fault is on me. But I can't help thinking that the popularity of foreign poems translated into English (not just Japanese, but think of Persian poems by Rumi, etc.) may be due to the boring nature of the old English poems. cf. While many poems in Manyoshu are made by anonymous folks, the main editor of the anthology is believed to be Otomo no Yakamochi, 8th century courtier/scholar/poet. (Being a good poet was an expected quality for all courtiers in his days.) ",
            "By far the most 'difficult' to read. You miss out on the depth from the original's with the translation, the word play just can't be replicated, and it'd take a poet to 'redo' them properly. And while this is arguable in any translation, I point to Royall who did a superb job in the Tale of Heike in getting the word play and multi-tiered language out from the original and into the english. Of course, you can't quite do what he did with a 31 syllable poem, so, maybe it's hopeless... still I believe it could be done better.So, not a great translation.But adding to that you are given 1000 poems between the unknown dark ages of japan and the Nara period. But they're all over, and there is very little background to each poem. Without the conveyance of the original and with very little history and with the near randomness of the material there was nothing to stand on. There was no story being developed (of course), but there was nothing to sink your teeth into. So, in respect to the book as presented, some pages I felt I was just reading and re-reading words -- bereft of all meaning.It is also, presented poorly. Any history or information was supplied by the original annotator c.a. 750 AD.....Anyways, a different translation, maybe with the original pre-heian period Japanese next to it for the sound and movement, and maybe with better context notes (as the Japanese language is nothing without context) this becomes readable.

            "Beautiful poetry, much about love and nature. The date from about 750 to 850. But at the end are two heartbreaking longer poems about poverty and the death of a child: Dialog of the Destitute and untitled poem 904 by Yamanoue, with two equally touching envoys, or summary tanka. Instructive are multiple linked poems on the same topic--e.g. plum blossoms in spring--that highlight the differences among the poets, some are inspired, some derivative.I don't know any Japanese and can't comment on the translation, but the resulting poems are well worth the time to read them slowly.",
            "This little book of haiku has put me back on a poetic track I left 4 years ago. Simple poems of few words that open a vast world of feeling and thought. Single phrases so lovely addition can only mar them. It's a collection, but if you love haiku check it out."

I liked the fact that the series matured enough that it introduced new writers and artists (and the old ones felt more at home).I still don't buy female warriors, though, and think they are almost as ridiculous as centaurs.",
            "Some fluff here -- a single issue on the danger of lawyers feels like something out of Discworld, not D&amp,D -- but there's also at least one segment of wordless, post-battle horror, that I think I'll return to when I'm thinking about scene-setting. (That's in Scavengers.)"

            "Another good volume. As I've said in previous reviews, there are two main issues with this series. One is that it doesn't really seem to be D&amp,D enough, if that makes sense. It's set in the D&amp,D Universe, but really it reads more like any other fantasy series. Maybe I'm just missing some of the references, but only occasionally does something strike me as really specific to Dungeons and Dragons.Secondly, there's a little too much comedy in the series, at least for my tastes. That could just be me, because it's not like it's a total humor book. I just would prefer more serious stories.That being said, I like the series and I like the art. It's still good, just not quite what I would have liked.",

These feature the overarching story line of magic becoming unstable and the gods walking Faerun, with particular focus to our characters. We also get the first and only annual, and then a story that develops both Timoth and Varja's characters. ",
            "Excluding the weird lawyer story, this volume was realy enjoyable. By far the best so far. What started as a guilty pleasure for me turned out really nice in this volume.Cool stories and art, and even though the characters are mostly flat and stereotypical, there's still fun to be had.One more volume to go...",

            "\u201cPhases of the Moon\u201d is one of the best arcs in the AD&amp,D comic. It nicely builts upon elements in the comic to date and integrates that very well with the Avatar event, all while keeping us guessing 8/10. The Annual has a silly premise that exists just to set up mostly mediocre solo stories by a variety or artists. The Timoth and Connor stories are OK, the others not so much 5.5/10. \u201cLawyers\u201d is a sort of funny but shallow story 6/10. Fortunately, things improve from there. The first issue of \u201cScavengers\u201d is probably Mishkin\u2019s best work, with a brilliant in-media-res beginning, beautifully told dialogue-less panels, and really great storytelling all around 10/10. The rest of the \u201cScavengers\u201d story is a fun enough tale with some depth 7/10.",
            "Yet more of DC's Advanced Dungeons &amp, Dragons comic. Honestly, by this point, the series was starting to wear on me. I was mostly just still reading it because I'd gotten it as part of a bundle. Getting through the first story in this (the one about the Goddess Selune) was a slog. It was just all seeming pointless. Then the one-shot Lawyers was at least kind of funny. It wasn't amazing, or anything, but at least kind of interesting. And then the Scavengers story was actually pretty good (although the dialogue was a little stilted at bits). So really, it's like 1 star for Selune, 2 for Lawyers, and 3 for Scavengers. So it averages out to about a 2.",
            "Some really good stories and some fun fillers. In the first story the heroes are drawn into a battle between goddesses when someone is impersonating Luna. Enjoyed that one. There is a annual that goes into the background of some of the heroes. There is a funny story about lawyers and Onyx. The last story is about Timoth and Varja that are cought into a power struggle, a dragon and centaurs. Fun and entertaining read. "

It is a war that will be fought with armies both conventional and magical, with bright swords and the darkest necromancy. Against this richly detailed canvas of alternate history and military strategy, Thomas Harlan sets the intricate and moving stories of four people.

            "Read as part of my ongoing shelf audit. Verdict: Not awful, but not a keeper.There's a lot going on here, which is ultimately this book's downfall: everything happens, but nothing really concludes. It's not so much clearly setting up for a sequel as it is clearly existing only to prepare for a sequel, and that's a valid strategy I guess, but not one that works on me. The concept that I was most interested in was the magic, which... sort of seemed like it was using concepts of platonic forms? maybe? It often felt like magic was taking second stage to descriptions of troop movements... and I don't just mean the exciting ones in actual combat. Harlan is very interested in detailing the effort it takes to move an army, and I applaud that diligence, but I also don't particularly care.Anyhow - curiosity assuaged, my copy will be donated to the library book sale from whence it came so they can make a little more from it.",
            "Rome and Byzantium against Persia with magic first round: impressive",
            "Over the last five years or so, I've been getting into alternative history, while realizing that a disproportionate amount of alternative historical fiction is bad. Thomas Harlan's The Shadow of Ararat generally conforms to this belief of mine. I remember a copy existing at my local library when I was in grade school, and although I never got around to reading it, I figured that it was a prominent work of alternative historical fiction. Given the small amount of reviews here on Goodreads, I am starting to doubt that.Anyway, the premise of the book is intriguing--the Western Roman Empire has endured past 476 AD, and its emperor decides to aid the Eastern Roman Empire against the Persians. Unfortunately, Harlan doesn't do much worldbuilding besides that--he tosses in a bunch of magic and treats it like a fantasy novel. I suppose it's theoretically possible to create a 7th century fictional Western Roman Empire which allows 17-year-old female centurion agents to exist, or for a son of a Roman emperor to spend time as a healer. But Harlan didn't put his work in--the point of divergence is 27 AD (when magic arises and protects the Roman Empire), but the world in the 7th century is exactly like it was in our history--except that the West is still intact, magic exists, and every character acts like they're in a late 20th century high fantasy novel. Yet somehow magic and the West existing for the last 600 years was so insignificant that Heraclius is faced with the exact same foreign invasions, at the same exact time, as he did historically. It seems like Harlan looked up ancient geography and places, as well as the events occurring during the reign of Heraclius, but neglected to really analyze how his own alternative history world would develop organically.The writing can also be a little rough or vague at times, which is probably why other readers found this boring. I never knew what the fuck was going on whenever magic was being cast. Combined with the half-assed worldbuilding, this book is readable but probably not worth one's time."

Written in a very stylized fashion - there's a lot of brushing of robes and repeated weather motifs, for example - Thomas Harlan builds his world up with steady strength and isn't afraid to kill off apparently major characters. Necromancy plays a large part in the magic system, which is suitably damaging to the caster as much as the target.",
            "The idea is so cool! This mix of ancient and alternate history was a lure I simply couldn't resist. The only thing that tarnishes the fun of this book is its length. I believe that had it been edited a bit stricter and cut away some 100 or 150 pages, it could have attracted Major Audiences. However, as it is delivered now, I'm afraid it's more for nerds and connoisseurs, but for those it's a dream.",
            " Amazon.com Review  Thomas Harlan's impressive first novel, The Shadow of Ararat, delivers big-screen entertainment. It's an alternate history with babes, battles, and believable magic theory and technology, not to mention political intrigue and major spectacle. The Roman Empire has reached our 7th century without falling or becoming Christian. Galen Atreus, Emperor of the West, and Heraclius, Emperor of the East, join forces to overthrow Chroseos II, Emperor of Persia. The book follows four major characters. Dwyrin MacDonald, a young Irishman learning sorcery, is prematurely initiated and sent to fight with the Roman army, though he can barely control his gift for calling fire. The Roman Thyatis Julia Clodia, a covert warfare specialist, leads her unit behind enemy lines. Ahmet, an Egyptian priest/sorcerer at Dwyrin's school, sets out to rescue Dwyrin but meets Mohammed (yes, that Mohammed). They join Roman allies Nabatea and Palmyra, desert cities facing superior Persian forces without Roman aid. Finally, Maxian Atreus, Galen's youngest brother, a healer-magician, discovers a curse protecting the State from inimical magic but also preventing nonmagical progress. He sets out to lift it at any cost, resurrecting canny Julius Caesar and searching for Alexander the Great--an even greater source of magical power."

            "Hannah Mai and her two daughters, Minna and Malka, live in Lawoczne in Poland. It's 1943, life for Jews is becoming precarious and so Hannah takes the difficult decision to leave their home and escape over the mountains to the refuge of Hungary. On the journey, Malka, the youngest daughter, becomes separated from the others and it's from that point that the book splits into two separate narratives - the story of Malka, and the story of her mother and Minna.Written originally in German and translated into English by Brian Murdoch,this is a book full of broken glass. It's written in a very precise manner that tends to avoid the great elaborate metaphor, but in doing so creates a story that is painfully acute. There are many many moments which are intensely moving but one in particular struck me. It is when two characters are picking a berry from a bush and one shares it with the other. I'll edit the names out in this quote so it's spoiler free: He opened his mouth without taking his eyes off her, and she put in the berry. She looked so strange, so different, as if she had no connection with the child she had once been. Embarrassed, Different Character turned away. She felt as if she'd been watching something that was nothing to do with her.If there is a more subtle, beautiful way to describe that moment when you fall in love with somebody, I am yet to read it. This is a story of survival and of love, and of the way your stomach turns in on itself after weeks of hunger. What I will acknowledge is that this isn't going to be a book for everyone. The ending's not quite what I expected. There are long periods where 'nothing' overt happens. There's a lot of quietness which I appreciate is ironic in a wartime book but that's the best way to describe it. But I think, in a way, that's what makes it great as well. This is a book where we see the best and worst of people, and we see it in a peculiarly graceful manner. The way it's almost underwritten at points forces the reader to absorb some of the tension Malka and her family are feeling. You reach out, pulling cues in from the wider story, to understand how you should read these pages - and it's unbearable because you start picking up on the clues, the surroundings, and become as closely embroiled in it as the protagonists are. Malka left me breathless at the end of it. I am impressed at Pressler's skill, and the afterword (which I urge you to read *after* you've read the book) left me in tears. This is a very graceful, painful and important book. ",

            "When the Nazi's began to invade Poland a Doctor alongside with her daughters must escape the Germans and flee to Hungary. Malka which is the youngest daughter of the Doctor gets sick along the way must be held behind. While being in a foreign country Malka learns that she mustn't rely on others but on her own determination. The novel Malka by Mirjam Pressler is suspenseful and intriguing because of the quality of it's imagery. In the novel the way it describes the conditions where they are crossing the border from Poland to Hungary in some ways it's relating to the conditions my mother alongside with my sisters had to cross the border from Mexico to the United States through similar conditions and the way the imagery was used it made me feel and connect to my mothers experience. Realistic diction was used when Malka got injured you could understand and sense her pain and in some ways could also see her injury. The book is a good book to read especially if you enjoy reading about the Holocaust or World War 2. ",

            "Wow. This book was everything and more. I have always been interested in the history of the Holocaust, but this book really expressed the fear of the Jews during that time, specifically through the eyes of a 7-year-old girl, Malka Mai. Pressler wrote this book after speaking to Malka Mai (a real individual) about her childhood experience, though she mentions that many fictional details were added. In the book, Malka lives with her mother, Hannah, and older sister, Minna. They receive warnings saying the Germans are coming to town to raid the Jews out. Upon hearing this news, Hannah plans to escape with her daughters to Hungary. It's not until Hannah notices that Malka is struggling with restlessness and sickness during the escape journey that she decides to leave Malka with a family. Hannah plans for Malka to be sent back to her via train after her journey is completed.I appreciated this book so much in that I realized how grateful I should be on a daily basis, for something as little as water. The word hungry is mentioned in the book quite a lot, and I felt heartbroken every time Malka had to scrounge around for food without knowing where she was or whether she would ever see her family again. In addition, though I am not a mother, the book really expressed a mother's love for her daughter. The ending was sorrowful to say the least, but I can definitely see that Hannah never meant to hurt Malka. The narration switches from both Hannah and Malka, so I liked that I was able to read the minds of two different characters.Malka is an appropriate read for all ages, and I personally think elementary/middle/high school students learning about the Holocaust would benefit much from this book. Thank you Mirjam Pressler, for writing not only an eye-opening book, but also a story that I will remember for the rest of my life.",
            "this was a true story. some of the decisions malka's mother made i sure didn't understand and couldn't relate to. so much happened to the family and well, really to everyone who experienced this horrific event. this is supposed to be a children's book or young adult book but some of it was pretty graphic. some kids might have a hard time that. i enjoyed it though for the most part."

Students in schools and colleges will benefit from short introductions to each play, to Roman stage conventions, to different types of Greek and Roman comedy, and there is a note on staging, with a diagram illustrating a typical Roman stage and further diagrams of the basic set for each play. The translators have paid more attention to stage directions than is usually given in translations, because they aim to show how these plays worked. This is a book to be used and enjoyed. --Raymond J. Clark, ,The Classical Outlook",

            "They say that comedy is one of the most difficult things to do well: it\u02bbs so much a question of timing, phrasing, even the choice of an individual word can make or break a joke (and perhaps a whole scene, as well). So much harder, then, is the job of a translator of comedy, and this combination of Plautus &amp, Terence, Parker &amp, Berg achieves very mixed results, but I\u02bbm glad that they made the attempt. Plautus, as the author of emotionally simple plots, boisterous energy, and almost non-stop wordplay, strikes me as the harder of the two authors to adapt. He is very much a product of his time and place and was well adapted to it, as his place as the more popular of the playwrights among the ancient Romans attests. But the result is that he doesn't necessarily travel well, across either time or space. We've no doubt lost much of the nuance of many of the words he uses and can therefore only guess at the effect that they would have had on the audience. Worst still, trying to approximate not just the jokes, but also the very sounds of the words themselves used to make them is would be a nearly impossible task under the best of circumstances. With this in mind, it's hardly a condemnation to say that Parker shoots a bit wide of the mark. His use of alliteration comes off feeling forced and the insults he uses end up just sounding foolish (but not in a good way). The energy is there, the art (and thereby, much of the humor, as well) is lacking.Berg's Terence is strikingly different. Terence is, of course, the more restrained, thoughtful writer, whose plots may not achieve the guffaws of a Plautine farce, but are nevertheless, in their way, more well rounded as pieces of literature. They give the reader (or, more ideally, viewer) not just something to laugh at, but something to think about: an engaged member of the audience cannot simply let a Terentian play wash over him like a Plautine, then leave the theater unchanged by the experience. Terence taps into some very basic conflicts, and they in turn almost force the theater-goer/reader to form an opinion, take a side, root for one character or another. And so, where Terence puts less emphasis on wordplay (which is not, by any means, to say elegance of phrasing) and more on ideas, his plays, it seems to me, are pre-primed for a potentially more positive reception from audiences of a far wider array of times and places.In the end, I enjoyed Berg's Terence more than Parker's Plautus, perhaps for the reasons mentioned above. But then again, it is all just a matter of taste, and as the Romans themselves might say, de gustibus non disputandum est!",
            "The translation was pretty colloquial, in my opinion. It was easier to understand. The only downfall to this is the names of the characters as they don't use their real Greek names. So it took a while for me to figure out what Dexter's Greek name was, and etc. It had a rocky start at first as it didn't capture my attention but after a few pages it finally made sense and found the humor in it.

            "This book doesn't just have a sagging middle--it has an enormous beer gut.The set up is intriguing -- what would happen if dead people started returning to earth. Not zombies, but just returning? The book takes that interesting premise and then...nothing. Most of the story is told through the Hargraves -- an elderly couple in Mississippi who's son Jacob drowned 50 years ago. Now the 8 year old is back after mysteriously appearing in China. (This weird location problem is something else that is never explained.) Lucille wants to pick up where they left off, Harold's not sure what to do and Jacob ... how can a resurrected person be boring? But Jacob is. He has nothing to say about death or the afterlife or why he returned. None of the newly resurrected do so what's the point of the book then?We get hundreds of pages of Harold and Jacob being locked up in an internment camp by soldiers who have no idea what to do except ask questions that the Returned can't answer. Lucille cooks a lot and goes to her church for answers, never finding any. Science doesn't even make an appearance in this book. Surely someone is trying to figure things out but we never see those people.There's no momentum to this story. None. I only finished to to see if the author would provide some kind of explanation or closure but there wasn't any and none of the characters had any spark to them, not even the living ones.Not recommended.",
            "There's this line in The Returned that can describe my mood throughout the book....but mostly the soldier only stood-or sometimes even sat- at the barricade, looking either very detached or very bored, depending on the lightning at that particular moment.Depending on the POV at that particular page, I either dozed or just skimmed through the pages. No, not really. It's weird but I can never skim through anything, I just gotta take it ALL in, no matter how constipated* or uninterested I feel. *Yeah, constipated!I believe the problem here lies with me. I couldn't feel for these characters, I couldn't sympathize, much less empathize with them. With no child, no dear departed, no beloved, I still do have a vivid imagination. Yet, this story barely moved me. More than halfway through the novel, I was literally looking out for the last pages. However, besides the main story of the Hargraves and their Returned son, the main characters of the novel, there were little snippets of other Returned's(as they are called) that got to me. Guess, I'm not so stoic after all.There was this girl whose parents didn't want her even when she was alive, and the senile woman who was simply proud of her son, the Nazi boys who died in one war and woke up to instigate another, the priest in love with a dead girl and the family whose only fault was their murder, also, the artist who came back to find the woman who brought him back long before.And the final one of Jacob's.These stories, and many others, of barely two-three pages, affected me in a way that the main story never did. The short escapes into various lives/un-lives were brimming with raw realism and had a fleeting tender quality that, I felt, was lacking in the main story. The fact that they didn't need useless, endless 'telling' of emotions, that they gave a provided a wider view of the tensions in the world, probably worked in their favor. As it turns out, sticking through the book paid off. As in, negative paid off, but not as adverse a negative as it was before. As in, lessened negative. As in, ah- what the hell! Like, my interest was -15 before and the last few hundred pages made it -4 or something. It's either the seditious baseness of my nature, or maybe the reader in me prefers action and locomotion, but the last few hundred pages pleased me. Not to spoil the book for you or anything but *ahem* Who wouldn't love her? Okay, maybe her grandchildren and the person at the end of that gun.The writing didn't work for me and consequently, Harold and Lucille never reached out to me. It was less of a storytelling and more like a recital of... something- something really boring! It never engaged me, despite the promising premise. Lucille was a flat character from the beginning and with very little personality. On the other hand, Harold had a good start and indicated towards being/developing as a character of depth but the delivery wasn't efficient. His personality and dimensions were lost a few chapters into in the book. As an instance, take Jack and Mabel from The Snow Child(fabulous book, btw. you haven't read? you make me so sad)- similar circumstances, but the characters were so much more realistic and colorful. These two weren't. Considering that Jason Mott's an established poet, I just expected a bit more 'showing' of emotions in the prose, again like Eowyn Ivey managed so perfectly. Moreover, the constant shift in POV's in every paragraph was confusing, at best, and disorienting, at worst. The lines tell us about the child and affinity for hiding and how he's looking at the colonel for a few lines, then the next few paragraphs are devoted to describing how the colonel is feeling, before jumping back straight into the boy's head again.Still, I think I just might check out the author's short stories. I certainly hope so. On the whole, I have no clue who I'd recommend this book. I guess, you have patience? Human heart? A bit of something special that I don't? Well, you're in luck! This just might be your book. A review copy was provided by the publishers.Crossposted on Books behind Dam{n}s"

            "One day the previously dead start returning, not as zombies, but exactly as they were when they died. One returnee is 8-year-old Jacob Hargrave, who drowned 30 years before. He shows up in China, and after being processed by the 'Bureau of the Returned' is brought back to his now elderly parents - Lucille and Harold - in Arcadia, Missouri. Though a bit befuddled, the Hargraves take in Jacob and care for him. Another local family, the Collins', all of whom were murdered, also returns to Arcadia and takes up residence in the church.Some townsfolk support the returnees but many are frightened, hostile, and want them gone. Moreover, when the initial trickle of returnees becomes a flood the American government turns Arcadia into a holding site and starts busing in masses of returnees. This type of situation is mirrored all over the world as more and more undead show up. The holding camps are okay at first but soon become overcrowded, dirty, and foul-smelling. The local clergyman in Arcadia, Pastor Philips, encourages patience but 'the real living' want to know what's going on, and they want to know now! Unfortunately, no explanation is forthcoming. The situation soon spirals out of control with dire consequences. The book is at least partially a treatise on how people deal with death - can they mourn the dead and move on? can they accept returned loved ones? returned strangers? a world where there may be no death? I thought the story had intriguing characters and it kept me interested. I was anxious to see what happened next and to find out how the returnee phenomenon was explained. In that I was disappointed because the phenomenon was not explained at all. Thus, though I enjoyed the story, I was left with a feeling of dissatisfaction.There is a TV series based on this book (called Resurrection).You can follow my reviews at https://reviewsbybarbsaffer.blogspot....",
            "I received an advance copy this book for free in a GoodReads FirstReads giveaway.I'm slightly torn about this book. The story line idea behind this book is a great idea. Also, I love how the author switched chapters with telling the story from the view of the True Living and the Returned. I also loved the ending with respect to the emotional issues of Jacob's parents. Those are the good things I can say about this book.That being said... I never really completely got into the story. The writing style just doesn't flow well, and I felt there could have been better description of events and personalities. But that could be because I really enjoy classical style writers who tend to sometimes be overly descriptive. Another problem I had was that there was no true resolution of the government's involvement in controlling the Returned, and there was no resolution of the purpose of the Returned. This may be the first time I have ever felt this way but... I believe this book would translate very well into a movie. Mostly because a movie would add to what is already there. I hope that the sequel will complete the story. If that ends up being the case, I would be completely satisfied with this story.Read more reviews at Great Minds Read Alike.",
            "This book is being heavily promoted and is now in production for a television series. It is a book that raises so many questions. The dead start appearing, (not a vampire or Zombie in the bunch, thank you Jason Mott) an eight year old boy who drowned at the age of eight, fifty years before is delivered to his now 70 yrs. old parents. The dead are the same age as when they died, at first this is looked on as miraculous but this soon begins to change.It raised many questions for me. I had been very close to my grandparents, if they appeared on my doorstep how would I react. That is the main premise of the book, because of course as more and more of these dead people keep returning the ugly comes out in many people. The government and the military get involved, had to know that was coming. Are these people miraculous or unnatural, demons in fact? Why when we fear something that is different most they be either or, is there not a middle ground? The town of Arcadia in North Carolina is turned in to a battle ground, but this is happening everywhere in the world. They actually staged a reading flash mob for this book http://jasonmottauthor.com/flash-mob-... and I really love this idea. I think the thing I liked best about this book is that the ending is not fed to us, it is not absolute but maybe left up to the reader based on what side of this happening they would have fallen. Quite different, quite good."

The two main themes--Tempe gets some sort of back off warning from the killer and promptly puts herself and/or her friends and family in imminent danger, and she gets knocked in the head A LOT--are tediously repeated here and I have faith that they will continue ad infinitum. To be honest, once I get to the part when she is rendered unconscious and awakens to find herself held prisoner but, strangely, left unshackled and therefore able to use her wits to escape in some manner (usually a timely rescue by clever men who somehow figure out exactly where she's gone off the grid), I start skimming because by then I really don't care that much about who did what to whom. What I find interesting about these books are the bizarre cases Tempe finds herself embroiled in, and the forensics. I do love me some grisly dead bodies, the more putrefied the better. It's a sickness. There are numerous flaws with this series, as mentioned above and also including ridiculously convoluted plots with too many threads. There is a certain amount of lecturing on various subjects--motor cycles, human rights, DNA, what-have-you--but some of that information is interesting. I'd never even heard of a spix's macaw before this book, for example. And these books are nothing like the TV series!!! Just kidding, I haven't ever watched Bones and would never expect a TV version of anything to amount to much. But I find Tempe amusing. Onward to book #7! I will keep going until I can't take it anymore.",
            "An unconvincing, totally forgettable novel. Like many other readers, I miss the elements that make the Bones TV show so appealing. I made the mistake of thinking that this was the first book in Reichs' series, so I was initially surprised at how phoned-in and convoluted it felt. The only part of the book that seemed passionately written was Tempe's environmental speech featured on the last two pages. Reichs writes in sentence fragments that read like sporadic bursts of machine gun fire, as if she had sent the manuscript to her publishers via telegram and was being charged by the word. Publishers Weekly refers to it as cut-to-the-chase writing, but I think it's lazy. Call me old-fashioned, but I enjoy the occasional verb now and then. I also don't care much for the cutesy elements throughout, such as the constant attention to the lovable antics of Tempe's pets or the way that her boyfriend continually acts cute in wholly unrealistic ways. And don't even get me started on Reichs' Sex And The City-syle attention to fashion and brand names. I can see the potential for Reichs to be a good writer, but this outing contains for too many cheesy paperback-romance elements that do nothing to serve the story and will simply alienate the male audience. Then there's the actual plot of this novel, which is incredibly weak and coincidental. It all builds up to an even weaker, more coincidental ending...and Tempe is given the fortuitous opportunity to kill the main villain in the absolute lamest way imaginable. I'm curious whether this is a series that simply jumped the shark, or if it was really this bad from the get-go. ",
            "UUUUUUUUGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHLike I said in my previous review, for book 5, this book and the previous one.. just weren't for me. Pretty sure I just repeated everything in my first sentence but that's because these two left me so shook. Not in a good way. It's getting tiring to see the same thing constantly happening.Temperance is ALWAYS in danger.She misses her kid.She misses Ryan.She solves the murder..but it takes FOREVER.The one thing that kept this a page turner was trying to figure out who killed the baby. So yea, the only thing that got me into this book was when she found those bones. Other than that, I just didn't care. Yeah, the other murder was an interesting add but it just seems to be repetitive. I don't want to say that I'm getting bored.. but I am and it's sad because I'm listening to the freaking audios! Those kind of books shouldn't make you bored.. but it's like I'd rather sit in traffic than keep hearing Temperance being in danger.I have no idea when I'm going to dive into the next book but I feel like I need a mini break from this series. Hopefully the next book will bring me out of this weird funk. I need something to get me interested into this book and characters again.",
            "Per usual, forensic anthropologist Temperence Brennan gets into a wild mess in the pursuit of justice. This time the world of drug trafficing, endangered species, and murder collide. Coming from a background as a forensic anthropologist myself I strive to be as unbiased as possible. When I say her books are very accurate I mean it. I don't find myself rolling my eyes and getting frustrated over inaccuracies. The only thing I have ever pointed out is that FA's do not play detective like Brennan does. We work death scenes and in labs and turn reports over to authorities. I do not mind Brennans excursions because it makes for some edge-of-your-seat entertainment and interesting subjects. I love this series and always jump into the next book as fast as possible.",
            "With a background in anthropology, I was intrigued by the idea of a book starring a female anthropologist, written by a female anthropologist. Kathy Reichs, of course, does and writes forensic work, which is far afield from the applied cultural material on which I once focused--but she writes a darned good novel! I liked the characters, and was pleasantly surprised to recognize the author's name when my kids turned on the TV show Bones, which I'd not watched before, Kathy Reichs is associated with the show, which stars the same lead character (Dr. Temperanceas Brennan, or Tempe) as her series of novels.The only real disappointment was that the plot was rather strongly formulaic, so that as I neared the end of the novel I found myself thinking, OK, when is Tempe going to find herself unexpectedly trapped alone with the killer, with no escape in sight until someone from the supporting cast just as unexpectedly bursts in to save her? I won't tell you whether or not that happens, but I'll go ahead and say that the word spoiler wouldn't really apply?On the other hand, formulas come into being because they work, and there's something comfortable sometimes about settling in with a novel whose basic outline you can predict, just to see how a new author explores the genre.The actual book recommended to me was a later one in this series, and I decided to start with this one, which I mistakenly thought was the first. It was good enough that I plan to read the others in the near future.And the big surprise? I've actually watched a couple episodes of the TV show now, and like them too!",
            "Reichs' books are an easy read (probably why I read them). I've read two of hers so far. This one for me was confusing. Because I couldn't read it straight through (or almost straight through), I couldn't keep up with the cast of thousands. Okay, there were not thousands but you know what I mean. I feel there are too many characters to really get a good grip on the story line. And, in order to close off all the various story lines without making this a HUGE book, some easy endings are opted for. One thing that really bugs me about the book is the in-your-face foreshawdowing. About three or four times at the end of the chapter sentences such as I was about to find out or I couldn't know how right I was are used. (I'm paraphrasing here). Come on, you don't need to hit me over the head -- be creative when forshadowing something. I'm intelligent, I'll get it.All that being said, I will probably read one or two more to see if anything differs. My fear is that the location and names will change but the storyline will not.",
            "My mother in law gave me this book at the beach because she knows of my interest in forensics, but, also, because Kathy Reichs attended UNCC (and she teaches there.) The story was good, but, I do not enjoy Kathy Reich's writing style. She uses improper grammar, incomplete sentences, seemingly random punctuation at times, overuses metaphor, and is sometimes hard to follow. Clearly, her style has not hindered her popularity. I had forgotten exactly what it was about this book I didn't like, and, I am addicted to BONES, so, I thought I'd give her another chance when I came across Break No Bones. Her novels read a little like I would imagine a screen play would read, as she describes the attitude or facial expression of a character in only a word or two, without using complete sentences. Somehow, it just seems strange to me, but, as a medical mystery goes, she does a pretty good job as a forensic anthropologist.",
            "Another corker by Kathy love the twists and turns also the characters are so real I can almost see them in front of me. Another 10/10 for the queen of death"

Author Zeev Maoz's unique double perspective, as both an expert on the Israeli security establishment and esteemed scholar of Mideast politics, enables him to describe in harrowing detail the tragic recklessness and self-made traps that pervade the history of Israeli security operations and foreign policy.,Most of the wars in which Israel was involved, Maoz shows, were entirely avoidable, the result of deliberate Israeli aggression, flawed decision-making, and misguided conflict management strategies. None, with the possible exception of the 1948 War of Independence, were what Israelis call \"wars of necessity.\" They were all wars of choice-or, worse, folly.,Demonstrating that Israel's national security policy rested on the shaky pairing of a trigger-happy approach to the use of force with a hesitant and reactive peace diplomacy, ,Defending the Holy Land, recounts in minute-by-minute detail how the ascendancy of Israel's security establishment over its foreign policy apparatus led to unnecessary wars and missed opportunites for peace.,A scathing and brilliant revisionist history, ,Defending the Holy Land, calls for sweeping reform of Israel's foreign policy and national security establishments. This book will fundamentally transform the way readers think about Israel's troubled history.\u00c2 Zeev Maoz is Professor of Political Science at the University of California, Davis.

            "Tactics, Strategies and MistakesThis is from the 2009 edition.Brilliant and comprehensive summary of the Arab-Israeli conflict taken from a military perspective, but with a major presumptive flaw, which one can find on pp 33-34 where Maoz comments on the malice, folly, and incompetence of Arab leaders claiming that their only relevance would be to make Israel's mistakes more pronounced. which amounts to overconfidence and hubris. Actions do not take place in a vacuum and to assume that one's opponents are stupid is no excuse to ignore the possibility of their success.Maoz's coverage of Israel's tactical situation is IMV flawless. Lacking geographic depth and surrounded by multiple fronts she has to act quickly, decisively and if need be preemptively. Israel, he observes, does not respond to every attack but uses a tit for multiple tat approach (see pp281 but also reference Axelrod's The Complexity of Cooperation: Agent-Based Models of Competition and Collaboration), waiting for the Arabs to overplay their hand, reminding their opponents of the availability of force as a deterrent. Similarly one must extend high praise to his coverage of key historical events and the considerations leading up to them.One area to differ with Maoz is in his assessment that military decision making should necessarily have greater oversight by politicians. The prime example here is the 1982-2000 campaign in Lebanon where Sharon kept the government uninformed obligating deeper and deeper involvement in order to achieve poorly defined and shifting goals, and in this case I completely agree. Sharon's bull headed tactics were long term strategic blunders. The same however must be said of Rabin, Peres and (Ezer) Weizmann who made the mistake of rescuing the PLO from oblivion by designating Arafat, who never grew beyond his role as a terrorist, as a preferred negotiating partner. On the other hand we have the 2006 war in Lebanon prompted by an attack by Hizbollah on Israeli towns and military targets. The response was directed by an inexperienced political branch and should have been terminated near the half way point after the stated goal of recovering the two kidnapped soldiers Eldad Regev and Ehud Goldwasser could not be achieved .A second problem is Maoz's assessment that the 1956 and 1957 wars were wars of choice instead of necessity. If necessity means immediate desperation, then he's right about 1956, though wrong about 1967. That kind of necessity would have come in 1957 or 1958 when the odds would have been much more in favour of the Arabs. Nasser was taking a salami slicing approach of starting from his wars of attrition so that eventually there would have been no options left, the same criticism Maoz uses (correctly) against Sharon in Lebanon. In '56 Nasser had dismissed the UNEF forces which were a buffer between Israel and Egypt and moved his troops into Sinai. The UN had folded much quicker than necessary, not even holding a debate or a vote on the subject, which later led Abba Eban to assess the UN as an umbrella that is taken away as soon as it has begun to rain. Nasser had also cut off the supply of oil and trade thru the canal - an act of war that in the short term would certainly have had dire effects on Israel's economy, its ability to wage a defense and it delegitimized the principle of the canal as an international waterway. Egyptian Brigadier General Ibrahim Sharkawy's comment in response to UNEF Commander Major General Indar Jit Rikhye question of intent behind the demand for withdrawal yielded I'll meet you next week at the best restaurant in Tel Aviv certainly signaled immediacy. The Egyptians had also started to receive large amounts of armaments from the Soviet Union.The situation was similar in 1967 where in addition Nasser was engaged in forging military alliances with other Arab countries, there were 90,000 Egyptian troops and 45,000 Syrian troops at Israel's borders, Jordan was mobilizing, all surrounding air fields had operational orders for attack and there was a naval blockade of her southern port. IMV the mid term intent within the year was to precipitate a war when they had, in their view, reached a point where they could win. In that sense a response in both years was time frames was necessary and optimal. 1973's failure to anticipate and react to Egypt's intentions in advance also supports the argument that Arab rhetoric and need for prestige is a highly important factor to take into account, in spite of a tendency to overplay their military preparedness.Last, consider Maoz's lack of coverage and understanding of the successes and problems along the diplomatic track. I find this unusual in light of his later book Networks of Nations which posits that the larger bar to war is not high level diplomatic pronouncements but the existence of large numbers of lower level connections and interdependencies between the parties. The underlying problem is not so much Israel's under seige mentality, rather that of side stepping the twin streams of pan-Arab and Islamic nationalism , somewhat at odds with each other but both believing that the Israel's existence represents a fatal hole in the Ummah that thwarts Arab/Muslim Destiny. Back channel communication (Heikal, Wanis-St. John, Zittrain) has been going on since the 1910s. The cold peace with Egypt and the cool peace with Jordan did set the stage for Oslo. And whereas trade with Egypt proved to be entirely one sided, under the radar trade with Morocco, Tunisia and the members of the GCC was reasonable and until the recent Islamic turn of the government, quite brisk with Turkey. However most of the success has had to be quiet, once elevated to the public sphere it becomes subject to rhetorical attack, posturing and even assassinations.Israel's relative safety and economic success are wonderful achievements, but cannot be used to justify giving up strategic military positions either in the Golan or in the Judean hills lest the rocket fire from Gaza spread to these locations as well. Already, under the shield of UN observers, Hiz'b'Allah has been able to flaunt in toto the provisions stipulating the demilitarization of south Lebanon and claims to be capable of hitting any location in Israel, not just the north, once again proving Eban's observations.In spite of these gaps, I strongly recommend Maoz's selection and presentation of events though by adding an emphasis on the external reality it's very reasonable to come to different conclusions. Former Egyptian President for Life Hosni Mubarek once reflected that The problem in the Arab nation is that if you express your opinion, and this opinion is different from someone else's, you are considered the enemy. The tenor of most Israelis I find is the opposite. Maoz most definitely has a place at the table."

            "This magisterial account of Israel's security strategy should be required reading for all who are interested in Israel Studies, Middle East politics, or the dynamics of the Israeli-Arab conflict. Maoz paints a detailed and well-substantiated portrait of an Israeli security \u00e9lite that seems incapable of thinking more than two steps ahead. What appears to the anti-Israel camp as mendacity and to the pro-Israel camp as justified defense is exposed as the tragic bumbling of a state that seems incapable of understanding its neighbors and their motivations. If Israel is to have a successful future in the Middle East, it needs to rethink its relations with both its traditional Arab rivals and its current nemesis, Iran. One can plainly see how Maoz's analysis can be extended to cogently explain Israel's stance towards the Iranian regime, a stance which suffers from the same foibles that led Israel to engage in numerous disastrous wars of choice with its Arab neighbors. To wit, the tenth chapter, on 'The Israeli Nonpolicy of Peace', which painstakingly charts Israel's 'missed opportunities' for peace, concluding with an expert analysis of the psychological, structural, and political obstacles to Israeli peacemaking, strikes me as the most important chapter in this very important book."

            "What the..? In a nutshell, 32 year old Flora is unhappy with her lot. At her best friends wedding, she makes a wish when the cake is cut - I wish I was 16 again cue her waking up the following morning as her 16 year old self. The premise is similar to the film 13 going on 30 but nowhere near as smooth. What essentially started out as a time travel concept quickly turned into a jumbled muddle. She hadn't gone back 16 years - she'd simply turned 16 again. For some reason she had gone back in time a mere month and only certain people from her previous life recognised or knew her. Her parents also travelled back to the age they were when she was 16 too. Confused? ME TOO. I don't UNDERSTAND. Sure there were sweet chick-lit-ish parts but mostly I'm just confused at all the backward and forwards and time travelling-but-not-really scenes.",

Flo's longtime boyfriend, the dependable (and boring) Ollie looks like he might be gearing up to go down on one knee and pop the question. As she heads for a weekend of wedding fun, she's got a lot on her mind, and none of it is all that good. Her unhappily divorced parents will both be there, and they can't safely be in the same room. The boy that got away will be at the reception, and just thinking about him has her as nervous as a cat in a room full of rocking chairs.When Ollie actually goes down on one knee, why does Flora run panicked and teary into the tent where Tashy and Max are cutting the cake, and fervently say...I wish I was 16 again.A silly and enjoyable book...but confusing. At first I figured it was going to be a Back to the Future story, and it is, but it also isn't. Because Flora is 16 years old again, and her parents are younger, and still married. But it's still 2003 (this was written a while ago) and only Tash, Ollie, and that old high-school boyfriend realize that Flo being 16 is all kinds of WHAT IS GOING ON HERE? So Flora and her parents have de-aged, but not gone back in time... wait, what?I spent a certain amount of time figuring that this was some kind of brain-tumor induced hallucination, or that Flora had passed out due to too much wedding champagne and too many sesame-covered sausages (don't ask) and was dreaming this. Once I decided that yes, a 32 woman woke up in her old 16 year old body, it was fine.Jenny Colgan makes me laugh. This is a little more slapstick than her later novels, but it works. While Flo find some things about being 16 inconvenient (Spots! Being grounded! Detention! Mean girls! Knowing her Dad is cheating on her Mum!) there are compensations (No jiggle anywhere. A small bum. A sense of perspective she didn't have the first time she did 16.)Will Flora be able to get back to her 32 year old life? Does she want to? Can she fix her parents' marriage?

            "The Trials of Brother Jero and Jero\u2019s Metamorphosis are the most comic and exciting plays I have read so far, and this is all due to its Nigerian colloquial speech, and charismatic characters! What is very remarkable about the characters is that Soyinka was able to allocate diverse character traits to them, but still unite them with the common trait of having multiple faces to their personalities and of being incredibly dynamic. My favorite character is Amope. Everything she says is incandescent with emotion and vivacity. And she is even vivacious when she is frustrating, that I did not notice her being annoying. This makes her a constantly amusing character. Also, since it is an unusual character trait, I felt like I wanted to know more about her, it makes her mysterious. For example, she makes the biggest deals about the littlest things. When Chume suddenly applies the brakes, she tells him \u201cafter all these years one would think he could set her down a little more gently\u201d (ii). One would be very irritated if a person kept on complaining about such silly and unintentional things. However, the sarcastic and witty tone she uses makes it funny. The best part of the plays is the mentioning of the African foods, like \u201ccola\u201d (ii) or \u201cyam\u201d (ii), and the African colloquial speech! Both elements allow the reader to feel more involved, as if he is there with the characters. The African colloquial speech makes the play so much more exhilarating and droll. The characters would say phrases, such as \u201cI dey\u201d (ii), \u201cde thing\u201d (ii), \u201ccommot\u201d (ii), which is the slang used in most West African countries. In The Trials of Brother Jero, both Jero and Chume curse Amope in their own ways, but they do not know that their annoyance is caused by the same woman. The irony here adds some mystery to the play. The reader knows that this is not accidental, and thus that something unpredictable will occur as a result of it. What is also humorous is the way in which they disrespect religion. Jero, a Prophet, uses religion to gain money. For instance, Chume wants to beat his wife, but Jero prevents him because if \u201che doesn\u2019t beat her, he comes here feeling helpless, and so there is no chance of his rebelling against him\u201d (iii). Jero also desperately tries to resist his temptation to have affairs. This is also comic because he wants the best of both worlds, money and women, and suffers to stick to one. However, the funniest of all is their actual prayers! Jero utters phrases such as \u201cAbraka, Abraka, Hebra, Hebra, Hebra, Hebra, Hebra, Hebra, Hebra, Hebra\u2026\u201d (iii), in order to put his customers into some kind of Trans. The fact that such phrases do not officially mean anything shows that he is manipulating his clients for money and cleverly mocking them. Nevertheless, what I really did not appreciate is all the unnecessary repetition. For example, when praying they would repeat \u201cForgive him, Father, forgive him\u201d (iii) countless times. These repetitions take away from the play\u2019s energy and make it a little boring. I recommend these plays to everyone. You will not find yourself sitting for hours trying to understand them, like other literature books, but you will rather enjoy them! ",
            "Wole Soyinka, a Nigerian, was the 1986 winner of the Nobel Prize in Literature, he was the first African, and so far the only Black African, to win the prize. Although he has written poetry, fiction and non-fiction, he is best known as a playwright. The Lion and the Jewel 1959 58 pagesThe second of his plays, this was written and performed in London in 1959, and published in 1963. It is a comedy, based on the rivalry of a young schoolteacher and an old polygamous chief to marry the village beauty. It is quite funny and there are unexpected turns, all of the characters are depicted as rather vain and foolish. The theme, though not treated as seriously as in the first play, is progress and tradition. This was the first play of the second volume.Kongi's Harvest 1964 83 pagesThis somewhat dark satirical play was first performed at a celebration in Nigeria, and has a celebration as its subject. The situation concerns the Harvest or New Yam Festival in a country called Isma (there are various plays on words, and references to -isms) ruled by a dictator named Kongi. Kongi succeeded to a traditional king or Oba named Danlola, who is now held in detention. The plot revolves around Kongi's attempt to get Danlola to present him with the ritual first yam, thus recognizing his authority over the harvest and legitimizing his regime to the religious among his subjects. (I would recommend that persons not familiar with Nigerian culture read Chinua Achebe's Things Fall Apart, written a few years earlier, first, as it also deals with the New Yam Festival and makes the situation clearer.)The Trials of Brother Jero 1960 29 pagesThe shortest play in the collection, like the previous play it alternates between two nearby locations and could probably be performed with two sets on the same stage as with many of Shakespeare's plays. Another farcical comedy, it concerns a professional prophet, Brother Jero, who is openly hypocritical in his asides to the audience, his assistant, and a woman to whom the prophet owes money. Soyinka later added two other plays about Brother Jero to form a trilogy.Jero's Metamorphosis 1973 41 pagesA sequel to his comedy The Trials of Brother Jero, but even funnier, a satire on the relations of church and state.Madmen and Specialists 1970 62 pagesOne of the most interesting of his plays I have read, a symbolic political satire. It begins with a discussion among four mendicants, survivors of the civil war. They are working in some mysterious way for the Specialist. Gradually we learn more about what is happening, this is another play I can't really summarize without spoilers.",
            "These plays show a great deal of creativity and verve. They depict the plight of African nations struggling beneath the influence of Western political models and the struggle to preserve traditional structures and norms. In The Lion and the Jewel and Kongi\u2019s Harvest, Soylinka looks grimly upon Western influence, and justifiably so. And while he doesn\u2019t present traditional society as a panacea, he seems to leave many questions unresolved. What are African nations to do? Can you turn your back on Western forms of government and society, yet enjoy the benefits of Western technology and medicine? It\u2019s not necessarily a playwright\u2019s job to answer these questions. However, to leave them so open invites a cynical fatalism. Kongi\u2019s Harvest is a wonderful play that I\u2019d love to see performed, mixing poetry, song, dance and drama. And the twist at the end provides an outstanding theater experience. ",

            "This is an extremely well-written book disputing the validity of the mainstream-accepted idea of human-caused global warming. It is well-researched, and makes a very strong case for an outlook that is contrary to most of what you might hear on the subject. While the author is occasionally a tad snarky with regard to those on the other side of the issue, he is nowhere near as uncivil as they gnerally are in regard to anyone disputing their accepted wisdom, nor does he sound as irrational as many people on his side of the issue do.I am nowhere near the scientist it would take to be able to definitively determine whether his claims are in fact accurate, or whether those who take the more mainstream approach have the truth on their side.I confess to bias in Bell's favor: I WANT to believe what he says, because I expect that if the doomsayers are correct, we are faced with two choices. Either we will cause a catastrophic climate change, or our entire civilization will collapse. Neither of these choices are acceptable, and picking between them is a damned-if-you-do, damned-if-you-don't alternative that I truly hope that we are not faced with. But whether Bell is right or not, one thing is certain: if you want to read a rational, well-balanced and researched statement of the argument against human-caused climate change, even if just to acquaint yourself with the arguments that need to be refuted, you'd be hard-pressed to find a better example than this book.",
            "Climate change is a polarizing subject which as a rule generates more heat than light. Ad hominem attacks and retreats behind claims of scientific consensus, by shutting down civil debate, do nothing to further public awareness and the search for truth.This will not do. Larry Bell has stepped up and written an accessible book on the subject. Unfortunately the subtitle, which refers to a \u201cglobal warming hoax,\u201d is not going to broaden his reading audience because the pejorative nature of the word \u201choax\u201d is unlikely to cause the other side to approach the book with a sympathetic disposition.So just who is Larry Bell? In his own words, \u201cFirst, I am not a climate scientist and\u2026 have never been associated with Big Oil.\u201d He mentions the latter in response to the constantly repeated ad hominem charge that the only people who write for this position are in the pay of the oil companies.So Larry Bell is not a climate scientist. He is, rather, by his own description, a \u201cspace guy,\u201d involved in space architecture and also extreme environments (such as polar facilities) on Earth.His \u201cbackground and interests emphasize a holistic perspective regarding basic principles that govern how natural and technical systems work, how they are connected, and how they can be managed to support the most complex system of all \u2013 us humans.\u201d All this is to show that although he is not a climate scientist, he is not entirely unqualified to speak to the issues at hand.The reason he wrote the book, he says, is that \u201clike many of you, I am a parent who cares about the future of my children and the generations who will follow. I want them to inherit a clean, healthy planet, along with the means to obtain energy sufficiency essential to comfortable lifestyles and economic opportunities. Conservation must be a big part of all solutions.\u201dTherefore he would regard himself as a true environmentalist, for \u201cenvironmentalism is not so much defined by what we are against as by what we are for, and neither fear not guilt are prerequisites.\u201d What would be a prerequisite is that it involve a commitment to what is true, to following the evidence where it leads, not selectively seeking evidence for a conclusion determined beforehand.Such an approach, however, is being stifled by the constant appeal to authority, where we are told over and over again that the debate is over, that 97% of scientists believe in anthropogenic climate change, that this is the consensus of the scientific community.Bell argues that not only is this not true \u2013 there are many scientists who are not convinced of that thesis, but more important, it is irrelevant, because science does not progress by counting noses, but by an open examination of the evidence. And Bell gives lots of instances where there has been not an open examination, but actual suppression, of contrary evidence to what the orthodox position would like to see.Bell makes several strong claims, and it is these which should be getting more attention in the media, rather than the conversation-stopping ad hominem attacks and appeals to consensus. Some of these are:1. The IPCC has repeatedly given evidence of political intrusions into science, appointing researchers and publishing evidence that support a predetermined conclusion while suppressing or ignoring researchers and evidence that would give a different story. An egregious example is the political, not scientific, insertion into the 1995 IPCC report of the phrase \u201cdiscernible human influence,\u201d effectively reversing the entire report, and purportedly ending all debate on this matter and providing an official foundation for the UN-sponsored Kyoto Protocol to follow in 1997.2. There is no scientific evidence that any climate crisis exists other than the hardships periodically imposed upon affected regions as a result of naturally occurring changes.3. Over the past several glacial and interglacial climate fluctuations, atmospheric CO2 concentrations have generally increased after, not before, temperatures have risen. This would suggest that there is not a simple cause-and-effect relationship between rising CO2 levels and global warming, and at the very least, it is not the whole story. Therefore, drastic (and extremely expensive) reductions in CO2 emissions are likely to have only minimal effects on climate.4. Climate models cannot predict climate change events or consequences, although the scary warnings we constantly hear are based upon them. They can be only as accurate as the knowledge behind them, and that knowledge is far from complete. One serious limitation is that climate models fail to incorporate solar influences, which are known to significantly affect climate.Now are these true simply because Bell says so? Of course not. But these are questions that deserve open debate rather than dismissal.The bottom line is that Bell does not accept the label which is sneeringly attached to his position, that being a \u201cclimate denier.\u201d He agrees that climate has not stayed the same over the course of the earth\u2019s history, but has often changed, sometimes more rapidly than today.In response to the alarmist predictions that are being made, warning us that we are headed for temperature increases that will be not only exclusively detrimental but actually catastrophic, he argues that life has thrived at times when the earth was much warmer than it is today. Not only that, but rather than violent weather increasing with global warming, he argues that the evidence suggests that it will actually decrease.So yes, climate changes and is changing. But so what? It always has. That human activity has some effect on it is not really the issue: the issue is whether, as the IPCC maintains, human activity is the primary driver of climate change. And here Bell insists that there simply is no evidence to support that claim.We might be tempted to use prudential reasoning and say, well, just in case the alarmists are right, aren\u2019t the potential consequences so dire that we should act anyways, despite the paucity of supporting evidence?No, says Bell, and he gives two reasons. First, he points to a project begun in 2004 called the Copenhagen Consensus, which involved three different groups of people, one being top level economists, the second being college students from all over the world, and the third a wide range of UN ambassadors. All three groups were asked to indicate where best to put resources to solve the world\u2019s most urgent challenges.Communicable diseases, clean drinking water, and malnutrition ranked highest. But in all three groups, climate change opportunities, including the Kyoto Protocol, ranked near the bottom. In other words, Kyoto, which one estimate put at $5 trillion for full implementation, would end up doing very little good for the world relative to costs. All three groups that participated in the Copenhagen Consensus judged that this would be a poor use of the world\u2019s finite resources in comparison to other urgent needs.The other reason Bell gives for not following a \u201cjust-in-case\u201d approach and prematurely making drastic cuts in fossil fuel use is that at the moment we have no alternative. He in fact says that \u201cArguably the most serious public deception perpetrated by the war against climate change is the notion that cleaner, sustainable energy options are available in sufficient abundance to replace dependence upon dwindling fossils that currently provide about 85 percent of all US energy.\u201dClean and safe Generation 4 nuclear power may be the only alternative to replace fossils, but it is probably a few decades away. If we rashly and prematurely try to push fossils out of the picture we will find ourselves in a real crisis \u2013 not a climate one but an energy one.Despite everything that Bell argues, and I think he does so quite well, there is going to be suspicion from the other side. I think it might help to hear from someone who used to be on the other side but has changed his mind because of the evidence.Bell cites Greenpeace co-founder Patrick Moore, who said, \u201cWe do not have any scientific proof that we are the cause of global warming that has occurred in the last 200 years. The alarmism has driven us though scare tactics to adopt energy policies that are going to create a huge amount of energy poverty among the poor people.\u201dWhen Moore was asked who was responsible for promoting unwarranted fear and what their motives would be, what he says is very consistent with what Bell has been arguing. He said, \u201cA powerful convergence of interests \u2013 scientists seeking grant money, media seeking headlines\u2026 environmental groups and politicians wanting to make it look like they\u2019re saving future generations \u2013 all these people have converged on this issue.\u201dClimate change is real. But to understand just what that phrase means and what is behind it, we need to expose and get rid of political intrusions into science. On both sides of the debate, people who care about leaving a clean and sustainable world for future generations, but want to do so on the basis of the truth, deserve to be called environmentalists and to be heard.",
            "Why does what is happening with the environment have to be political. Rs on one side, Ds on the other. This is a poorly written, badly researched book with little in the way of facts. Just a lot of blather. What a mess.",
            "By now, the international climate business has degenerated into a scheme to transfer resources from developed to developing nations. Or as cynics put it, \u201cfrom the poor in rich countries to the rich in poor countries.\u201dThe truth is that there is no evidence for any significant human impact on global climate, and that there is nothing in a practical sense we can do to affect global climate. And, as Larry Bell points out, a somewhat warmer climate with increased levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere would be beneficial overall to Earth\u2019s inhabitants, especially to those in developing nations who depend on agriculture for a living. Climate of Corruption brings a breath of fresh, cool air to the overheated climate debate.\u2014S. Fred Singer Former director of the US National Weather Satellite Service, professor emeritus at the University of Virginia, and coauthor of Unstoppable Global Warming*Government, corporate, and private climate change research funding depends upon delivering results the sponsors want. What if it turned out that climate change follows natural cycles, and for good or for bad, we don\u2019t have a lot to say or do about it? That would qualify as a true climate change disaster for thousands of scientists, administrators, and their families, whose work and lives have come to depend upon causes that are anthropogenic (resulting from the influence of human beings on nature, hereafter used interchangeably with \u201cman-made\u201d). ...We have been grossly deceived regarding purported scientific evidence of a man-made climate crisis. Anyone who claims to know what climate changes will occur a year, a decade, or even longer ahead is either a fraud or a fool. Speculations are a different matter, and variant theories abound. That\u2019s what moves science forward and helps keep it honest through authentic discourse and objective examination.The corruption of science that was publicly exposed through the release of purloined CRU e-mails came as no surprise to many who have witnessed these travesties or dared to challenge the claims. Timothy Ball, a former climatology professor at the University of Winnipeg, received death threats for presenting his beliefs. As he puts it, \u201cCO2 was never a problem, and all the machinations and deceptions exposed by these files prove that it was the greatest deception in history, but nobody is laughing.\u201d He adds that he has \u201cwatched climate science hijacked and corrupted by this small group of scientists \u2026 Surely this is the death knell for the CRU, the IPCC, Kyoto and Copenhagen, and the carbon credits shell game.\u201d1Has the importance of the CRU scandal been overblown? This isn\u2019t simply a matter involving a few random researchers who lost their professional compasses and made some inconsequential mistakes. Rather, it involves several of the most influential representatives of a climate science community that has received more than $30 billion from US taxpayers over the past 20 years \u2026 and one that guides many trillions of dollars in policy decisions. These are key people who have\u2022xa0 controlled central processes and findings of the UN\u2019s IPCC climate science reviews and leading publications in that field,\u2022xa0 issued alarming predictions that have dominated world headlines,\u2022xa0 mobilized and presided over international climate change crisis summits attended by thousands upon thousands of delegates,\u2022xa0 provided the rationale for draconian environmental and energy regulations that significantly impact local, regional, national, and global economies,\u2022xa0 dictated moral imperatives to justify massive transfers of wealth and power between population segments and nations, and between citizens and their governments,\u2022xa0 established the basis for government agencies rather than competitive free market processes to pick energy and technology winners and losers, and\u2022xa0 afforded a good cover story for blatant and unproductive cap-and-trade profiteering.Is this all connected to a diabolical, centrally organized conspiracy? Probably not. More likely, it reflects a confluence of separate agendas that are well served by, if not totally dependent upon, a man-made global warming premise in general and demonization of carbon in particular.Larry Bell",
            "Good book. Climate Change agenda is really a socialist agenda. I\u2019m a little confused with one part in the book saying that environmentalists are also anti-globalists. The environmentalist agenda is pushed by globalists. Maybe this has changed since Al Gore. George Soros name keeps coming up for someone who is not a climatologist. This book also says it\u2019s not a specific globalist agenda... but it really is a very specific and scripted agenda by a few globalists elites who need a power grab. I\u2019m not sure if the author is trying to say that this agenda that they are pushing is accidental and uncoordinated. That would not make sense at all. The book is clear that the science behind this is a fraud. Balanced between science and politics. "

            "The author is coming from the position of: Yes, the climate changes. That's what the climate does--it changes. But the so-called settled science of the anthropogenic cause of climate change is not only far from settled, it's highly suspect, as are the motives of those leading the charge against it. The author shines a footnoted light on the flawed climate models, the manipulation of data to support the narrative, and the suppression of data and scientists that do not support it. He also delves into the motivations of those beating the man-made climate change drum. From the rather benign environmentalists who think scaring the batcrap out of people will motivate them into changing their behavior to something more to their liking (think the Overton Window method) to those who are motivated by money (in the forms of getting grants by supporting the approved outcome and those who are positioning themselves to make a pantsload of cash with things like cap-and-trade) and/or power (think watermelons--green on the outside and red on the inside). This is a position I share. I freely admit this. However, the author does a good job of presenting his case, and should be read by both the skeptic and the believer.",

However, I felt the author was very narrow-minded towards certain ideas and was very negative towards anyone who had an opposing view to his. There was no middle ground anywhere.Some of his ideas are contradictory towards each other. In one chapter he tells us that the increase in the use of coal, oil etc., is not contributing towards climate change and then in others he is telling us to use public transport more. It seems to me that he needs to sort his thoughts and ideas more. It is good to view one side of the global warming debate but needs to be taken with a contrast of anthropogenic causes towards climate change as well. Use a variety of sources to form your opinions \u2013 not just this one.",

Is it a reliable, scientifically sound source? Or is it something else?This book was an eye opening read that provided a view about climate change that everyone should be privy to.

            "The Giant and How He Humbugged America by Jim Murphy tells the extraordinary story of one of the biggest hoaxes in American history. In 1869, a giant stone man was discovered on a farmer's land in Cardiff, New York. Doctors, scientists, and other experts weighed in on the rampant speculation that had taken over as to the giant man's origins. As word spread of the remarkable discovery, the nation was captivated by the giant's existence. However, the truth came out that the Cardiff Giant was a hoax, one that had lasting effects on all the people involved.The first criticism of the book may be made in its length, finishing the story at 97, text-heavy pages with very few illustrations or photographs interjecting. The length may not have been an issue had the text been necessary, but several times, the story seemed to wander and become unfocused. Murphy seems to struggle with an issue that many researchers have found, which is deciding what of their prodigious research to keep and what to discard. Some extraneous details work well, like the doctors worrying that the unclothed giant might provoke the village women to have sinful thoughts (p. 21), providing some flavor for the time period and a quirk-of-the-lips humor into the scene. Others, like a brief discursion into the history of the Church of Latter-day Saints, seemed out of place and unnecessary. It is apparent from later chapters that Murphy attempted to tie this in, but the entire discussion could have been excised with no detriment to the surrounding prose. The effect is that the prose often drags, particularly in the beginning, as it is weighted down under digressions and detours. It takes, in fact, forty-six pages (nearly at the halfway mark) before it even reveals: The ugly truth was that Stub Newell was a bold-faced liar! (p. 46). While it was likely that this was intentional, intent does not necessarily mean that it was a good idea. Like hoaxes themselves, books about hoaxes need to be quick and engaging, otherwise the public becomes suspicious and starts thinking too deeply about them, often to unfavorable results.The lack of focus sometimes does work to elevate the book beyond another retelling of a famous event. Murphy, rather than focusing solely on the event, weaves it into the greater narrative of American history at the time, tying it into the Civil War's effects on the nation, the passage of the Fifteenth Amendment, and even other hoaxes at the time, like the Great Zeuglodon and the Fox sisters. The large cast of characters - helpfully listed on the first page - is an indication of where this technique becomes a drawback rather than an asset. The slew of characters and quotes being thrown rapidly into the text can become overwhelming and hard to keep straight, particularly as Murphy rarely takes the time to develop and introduce the characters at length before quoting them immensely. A slower build, with the time to develop the cast of characters, would have alleviated this onslaught immensely. Murphy's pacing with regards to characters is much too fast, while too slow in the story.The story is peppered with enough sources from the time period to reflect its accuracy, such as an excerpt from a local paper that sets the scene for the story beautifully while also providing a touch of authenticity to the prose. Even Murphy is unflinchingly honest in his prose, at one point, he writes, Newell must have said he would consider Boynton's request... (p. 25) rather than he said he would consider. The difference reminds the reader that, as thoroughly sourced and accurate as the story is, some of it will be speculation based on reasoned guesses. In another, Murphy's wording carefully differentiates between fact and speculation on a particular man's motivations (p. 9) or remarks that it's possible (p. 26) that certain events may have occurred. Murphy does not shy from admitting this, however, which is a welcome dose of straightforwardness in the nonfiction genre, though it also may explain his reticence to developing characters, as to characterize someone necessitates speculation. Several primary sources also decorate the text, such as excerpts or entire articles from the time period regarding the giant.However, some of the illustrations are a stretch, and seem to have been placed only as a way to break up the text-heavy pages or to support the less relevant details of Murphy's prose. At one point where Murphy digresses into a brief history of a colorful, eccentric man from the village who examines the giant, John Boynton, the illustration depicts LDS leader Joseph Smith being attacked by an angry mob. Another has a picture of a campaign ad ran during the passage of the Fifteenth Amendment. While certainly interesting on their own, they seem bizarrely out of place and shoehorned into the main text.Murphy remains balanced when he steps out of the main story. When writing about why the nation was so captured by the discovery, he remarks that, Between 1861 and 1865, newspapers had been filled with stories of terrible Civil War battles... The Cardiff Giant offered readers something positive and inspiring to think about, something to distract them from more troubling news (p. 30). He strikes a good mix of factual, research-based evidence, and speculation on the feelings at the time, though remains mostly silent when speculating on individual people's emotions or thoughts.The end includes thorough sourcing of Murphy's research, including source notes for each chapter, an author's note regarding his research, a selected bibliography, and photo credits for the historical photographs sprinkling the text. For all its faults, The Giant and How He Humbugged America appears to be an accurate, verifiable accounting.On whole, however, The Giant and How He Humbugged America is a mixed bag that at times can feel interesting almost in spite of itself. The story is fascinating, but frequently unfocused and bogged down by irrelevancies, like a student stretching a narrative into torturous snarls to make a word count. Here lies the central problem with the book, however: Murphy apparently believes that the most interesting part about the Cardiff Giant hoax is anything but the hoax itself. Pages are dedicated to the historical times, the history of the LDS church, and even other - apparently more interesting - hoaxes, but only a brief, sketchy detail of how the Cardiff Giant hoax was pulled off is included, coming in at a paltry eight pages. It is likely that this, too, was deliberate, but leaves the readers - who picked up a book about hoaxes, humbuggery, and hoodwinking - feeling not a little bit flim-flammed themselves.",
            "Non-fiction for kids about the Cardiff Giant, which was a hoax I didn't know much about before this. It is lengthy, but interesting. ",
            "Like all of Murphy's work, this was thoroughly researched and documented, and incredibly interesting to boot. Granted, I'm one of those types that would've been paying to see the damn thing, being the total sucker for tourist schlock...",
            "(2012) This fascinating account of a sensational hoax in 19th Century New England seems very current-themed and relevant to today, because human nature has not changed a bit. People still flock to see what's trending, believe what they want to believe, and take advantage of each other for profit.Jim Murphy is an award-winning author with an obvious love for American history. He painstakingly researched the details of this story, and provided evidence for every claim, backed by citations to 150-year old documents and photographs.So, some men digging a well on a farm in Cardiff, New York, in October 1869, uncovered a giant stone man. Very quickly, news of the unique discovery spread, and soon people were speculating that it was not a statue, but a petrified human being. Over the course of the following several months, tents were raised, thousands of people came to view the giant and express their own opinions, local businesses thrived, and the legal ownership of the object in question changed hands for large sums of money. All the debate is carefully authenticated by the author, who studied newspapers, advertisements, pamphlets, personal letters, and journals from 1969-90. Reputations were maligned, lives were lost to suicide, fortunes made, and replicas appeared, vying for the public's attention. But gradually, the truth became apparent. The giant was created and planted by people who wanted to profit from duping the community. As quickly as the novelty had grown in popularity, it faded away into obscurity. Now it is a faded memory that would be lost altogether if it weren't for historians like Jim Murphy.The illustrations, consisting of artifacts and sepia-toned photos, completely support the tone of the story. It's not an easy job to design such an authentic account of events and characters that lived more than a century ago, but this one is masterfully done. I read every credit and notation.target audience: 5th-8th grade",
            "What are we to make of the proliferation of true-life hoax books for children filling our library and bookstore shelves this year? Whether it's the clever ruse of The Fairy Ring scandal or the sheer number of middle grade chapter books featuring jackalopes (I've seen five so far) there's something to be said about the natural human desire to believe in the impossible even in the face of overwhelming evidence to the contrary. Into this mix drops yet another great American hoax, all but forgotten today. Author Jim Murphy has covered serious subjects like WWI Truce, An American Plague, and The Great Fire. Now he turns his attention to the seemingly lighter fare of the Giant of Cardiff, showing all of us that even in the midst of what seemed like a harmless hoax, real damage to real people erupted when folks hoped for the impossible.Nobody saw it coming. One minute some workmen were digging a rudimentary pit for a well and the next they'd unearthed a foot. And not just any foot, mind you. A giant foot. Next thing you know scientific experts were labeling the discovery of a giant stone man to be the petrified remains of a real giant and folks were flocking from miles around to catch a glimpse. Soon investors were getting involved and accusations of a gigantic hoax were leveled at those involved. The truth? They were right. Dreamed up by the mildly brilliant schemer George Hull, Murphy tracks the rise and inevitable fall of a giant that typified an America moving into the 20the century, trying to find its way.As Mr. Murphy tells us in his extended note A Word About My Research, the impetus for this book came from none other than Bernie Madoff himself. Initially Jim thought it might make sense to write a bit of children's nonfiction on Bernie, before deciding that there was a very great likelihood that it would lack historical perspective and be more of a glorified magazine piece to say nothing for how poorly it would date. Then he thought about doing something on Charles Ponzi but there was one huge problem with focusing on either Madoff or Ponzi since, they were/are dull little men. In this light the Cardiff Giant is positively sparkling with energy and amusement, though Murphy never lets us forget that in the midst of the hoax at the heart of each episode, whether done for profit or laughs, was deception.. A man killed himself in the wake of the Giant reveal and there is only a short drop from a large scale prank of this sort to a more contemporary monetary bilking of an American public. Even in his Other Famous Hoaxes section, we enjoy reading the various historical pranks/cons on display but can't help but notice that for all that we think ourselves to be so smart and savvy today, the Archaeoraptor liaoningensis of 1999 and the Shinichi Fujmura finds of 2000 show that we're still inclined to see what we want to see. All it takes is a little push.Even as he connects the tale to the present, Murphy knows how to tie the Giant's story to its times. Every good phenomenon ends up being a case of being in the right place at the right time. In this particular example, the Giant came to prominence in the midst of two major historical shifts. On the one hand you had a post-Civil War America that was, in Mr. Murphy's words, desperate for something positive and inspiring to think about. Fights over the fifteenth amendment were springing up left and right and newspapers in particular were desperate to think about something else for a change. Then, on the other hand, you had the rise of the Industrial Revolution with small towns feeling inadequate, desperate to connect to something bigger (literally, in this case) to themselves. Mr. Murphy has a kind of gift for looking at the big (there's that word again) picture, letting kid readers know that no event, no matter how weird, exists in a vacuum. I can only hope that history teachers teach this to their kids, and encourage them to look at our own current phenomenons, placing them in contemporary context too.Murphy takes care to begin his tale without the benefit of any preface or opening. Certainly there's a Cast of Characters that, if read carefully, might reveal where this story might go (and for the record, I LOVED that he put that list at the start of the book rather than the end) but once you start reading all assumptions instantly fly out the window. Mr. Murphy puts you there on the spot as events play out. Everything from a one-armed worker's hangover to the blaze of autumnal leaves makes it into the introductory scene. The result is an immediate sense of wonder akin to what the hired workers would have felt. Any kind of a preface would have defeated the immediate sense of mystery. Maybe Murphy figured that the best way to tell about a hoax was to hoax the reader as well so that by the time you read the words The ugly truth was that Stub Newell was a bold-faced liar you're as shocked as any curiosity seeker at the time would have been. I recently visited with my sister in Beverly Hills and as we walked through the streets of Hollywood passing everything from a Guinness Book of World Records museum to a Ripley's Believe It Or Not I came to the not wholly unexpected conclusion that there is very little difference between the American appetite for the spectacular today versus the American appetite for the spectacular a hundred or more years ago. Jim Murphy knows this. It's interesting to pair his book alongside Candace Fleming's The Great and Only Barnum as two distinct and different looks (or are they the same?) of late 19th-century humbuggery at its finest. The Giant may now be just another roadside attraction, but Murphy's book is the kind of text that we can only hope will stand the test of time.For ages 10 and up.",
            "Jim Murphy presents the 19th century's biggest moneymaking scam. In 1869, workers unearth a ten-foot-tall petrified man on a farm in Cardiff, N. Y. (Murphy provides in the beginning a helpful section titled A Cast of Characters who will be involved in promoting the Giant to the public.) Scientists visit Cardiff and quickly decide the Giant is ancient, and newspapers spread the word. Soon crowds of people pay to see the mysterious figure as it tours the region. Murphy provides other historical happenings for context along with photos. The author offers more information in the back matter's section Other Famous Hoaxes. I recommend this book for middle graders learning about research. Murphy's clearly written A Word About My Research, along with his Source Notes, and Selected Bibliography (two parts: one lists material about the Giant, and the other focuses on historical and cultural information) is excellent. Once again, Jim Murphy has told a good story.",
            "Jim Murphy has done it again. Awesome narrative nonfiction tale of one of the greatest hoaxes in American history, and I didn't know anything about it! The end notes are great, as he describes his research process and has thorough resources in the bibliography for additional information. Looking forward to ordering this for my MS library!",
            "Interesting read. What a absolutely horrible man! Very tongue in cheek when they talked about the Latter Day Saint church and the early history. Will not keep in my library for that reason. In my opinion the whole book is about modern science not always being as reliable as everyone thinks. "

            "This volume piggy backs onto the second Suicide Squad volume Suicide Squad, Vol. 2: Basilisk Rising, which is kind of cool. I can see Mitch's side of things in this book, and the more I read about his powers, the more they intrigue me.Mitch's origin is very strange and not quite what I thought. I'm glad that he is not like he used to be, because he used to be a real tool, and that's putting it lightly. There is tons of action in this book, and I could see it as a pretty cool tv show or movie adaptation, although they'd have to turn down the violence a tad.The ending is one what gives you a 'huh' moment and makes you wonder what's going to happen next. And I see there's only two volumes. That's too bad!Overall rating: 3.5/5.0 stars.",
            "So three stars on this one, when it would have been four. Except for the fact that they had this awesome, perfect explanation for Mitch's resurrections/powers-gained-therein and this COMPLETELY lamesauce ending that followed immediately afterwards. It SUCKS. I want more, dammit!!! I really wish this one wasn't cancelled, cause I feel like if given more time it could have spread it's wings in some interesting ways (much like the shitty cancellation of iZombie, actually, except this got two less volumes than that one did).",
            "Against the Suicide Squad (8-9, SS 9). This is classic Resurrection Man: Mitch learns a little bit about his past, tries to discover more, and meanwhile someone else makes a grab at him. Mind you, that doesn't mean it was great, as the story was shallow and full of fighting. Sadly, I think the Suicide Squad issue was better than the RM issues, because it had interesting character development and interactions -- though I was puzzled that a woman that I thought was shot dead in SS #9 seemed to be there in RM #9 6/10. Heck, I might have started picking up SS after this issue based on its quality if I didn't know that DC has fired at least two SS authors since #9. The Rest of the Comic (10-12, 0). The Resurrection Man comic starts to pick up velocity as it nears the end. Issue #11 is particularly nice with its attention to almost every major force that's bedeviled Mitch in the New 52. When we final gets answers in #12 and #0, they're interesting ones that made this new version of Mitch a worthwhile read. My only complaint is the bad art in the final issue, which was at odds with everything that came before.In the end, I don't think the New 52 Resurrection Man was as good as the original one, but it was still a nice (if shallow) return to the old theme. Now I just wish that DC would reprint the other half of Mitch's original run (though I'm pretty sure that hope is in vain).",
            "The second volume of the New 52 Resurrection Man series was a lot better than the first. The mystery surrounding Mitch Shelley is solved, and there's a cool interlude with the Suicide Squad flying in and making their mischief (to what end is not clear). Mitch meets a psychometric named Kim Rebecki, and she becomes his constant companion to the end of the book. She's a pretty good character all her own, and I'd love to see more of her. There's a lot of action here, and the story moves at a good clip.The series seemed to be able to wrap up in a nice fashion, even though it was canceled. Nothing feels too rushed and the previous volumes Heaven vs Hell over the soul of Mitch is taken care of as well. Too bad we didn't see RM as part of the Justice League Dark, as he would have fit in pretty well there, I think. Looking forward to seeing the Body Doubles again, also. Art is varied this time, with Fernando Dagnino and Jesus Saiz providing most of it. Rafael Albuquerque and Francisco Francavilla provide some really top notch covers. ",
            "Definitely a pity that the series has been canceled, is of a quality not less than many of the most sold Mainstream collections.In this second Abnett volume deepens the elements that make it interesting and give a kind of closure, which works, without being too rushed.It would be celebratory that they will continue with the character's walk in some way.",
            "Mitch Shelley\u2019s adventures, at least for this series, conclude and we get to know a bit more about who he is an was, but that may be the issue here. As a long time comic reader, this resolution feels more like a merging of Constantine\u2019s trickery with demons and Swamp Thing\u2019s origins under Moore than something that coiled between the supernatural and the technological. Part of the joy of Resurrection Man was that he may be more than he knows, that characters with supernatural powers have \u201csensed\u201d that he is an older force and something more in the original 90s run, yet here it seems we get a conclusion that feels less than, perhaps because the authors, wisely, wanted to wrap up the story before cancellation, which befell the series. Still, there\u2019s enough to like here and the feeling remains that Mitch, as a hero, is still more of an Everyman - albeit one who cannot die - even when facing off against angels, demons, and perhaps darkest of all - the darkest sides of an uncontrolled black ops government program that makes the Suicide Squad seem reasonable.Not as epic as the first run in the 1990s, and not as complete in world building as the volume that proceeded it, this second volume feels rushed a bit, but still compelling enough. As the series closed, things may not have been pitch perfect, but this was still sharp enough that, should DC pull Mitch from the abyss once more in the future, I will be there. ",
            "You ever pick up something and think 'ok, yeah this looks interesting. let's read it,' start to read it, get a few pages in and realize this is the second volume and you never read the first and you aren't even sure you own the first and as a matter of fact where the hell did this even come from and who bought it because it wasn't you and what?Yeah. I did that with this. Hey, it wasn't bad. Some fun cameos in here. Art is cool. Story is interesting and fun and unique. I dig. ",
            "Not as good as vol 1.Wraps up the series, and really it is probably for the best. As a finite series is was a good story, but if it had kept going it would have gotten old pretty fast. The being chased by covert government agencies storyline always gets old fast no matter how well it starts. ",
            "Not as great as volume 1 but full of interesting twists. In the end, it reads like a Hellblazer book."

            "With Mike Carey at the helm we see the return to a long-term plotline in this collection. Early chapters seem like one-off stories, but they artfully connect to the later plot and provide background details to further enrich the tale. As per usual, the issue-spanning saga has Constantine on hand to save the world again - or to at least try in his haphazard but sincere manner. Carey draws on multi-cultural legends (Celtic, South American, and Judeo-Christian) for Constantine's new foe - a dog-typed demon that seems to have the power to open the gates between the realms from the bad side, which is definitely not the norm. It seems that not all of the other realms denizens want this breach though, so Constantine may have some aid, even if it is unasked for and less than savoury. ",
            "It is the paradox of power. Those who have the least are always the most eager to use it.Black Flowers is a collection of short stories in which John Constantine travels the world in search of clues leading him to the identity of his latest foe, the shadow dog. In the course of his search, he brings Swamp Thing out of retirement and grows closer to his latest girlfriend Angie. While he does possess an inordinate amount of occult knowledge, Constantine usually bests his opponents not by overpowering them, but by simply tricking them. If comic books are modern day mythology, Constantine is without a doubt the trickster god."

        "desc": "Published for the first time in English, ,The Mountains of My Life, collects the classic writings of world-famous mountaineer Walter Bonatti, and tells the real story of the 1954 controversy over the events on K2 that changed his life.,Bonatti is one of the greatest mountaineers of all time, a man who continually reset the benchmark of human possibility by ascending routes that others dared not even contemplate. He climbed with an audacity and panache that epitomized the purest spirit of alpinism, and inspired an entire generation of climbers. Jon Krakauer calls him one of my heroes. He is not only a mountaineer of astonishing talent and vision, but one of the world's most engaging writers about mountaineering.,Bonatti has also been dogged by controversy and often been at odds with the climbing community. ,The Mountains of My Life, not only collects the best of Bonatti's writing telling of adventures in the Alps, the Himalayas, and little-known South American peaks it also tells Bonatti's version of what really happened on the Italian expedition that made the first ascent of K2 in 1954. Bonatti's selfless actions helped avert disaster, yet in the expedition's aftermath he found himself cast as a scapegoat. Part detective story, part hair-raising adventure, part meditation on his craft, ,The Mountains of My Life, is as awe-inspiring and controversial as its author, and is beautifully illustrated with Bonatti's own photos.",

            "To those having a bit of knowledge of alpininism, the name Walter Bonatti is met across many books , that of a man having overcome some of the most difficult climbs in the Alps , that of a man smeared by others after the K2 incident , and that of his grandiose good bye to alpinism on the Cervino. From hearing a few interviews of Bonatti, and reading this book, you understand how deeply spiritual (though not believing in god) A man Bonatti is , how his alpinistic life and further adventures were lived out of a conjuction of ethics, search for the unknown and its limits. And indeed, in this beatifully written book, it is the personnality of Bonatti that stands out , that of a man of intimate convictions, probably feeling misundertood, and of a singular deep belief that finding his inner self his the most important thing , and that compromising with it the most unacceptable.I could extract many quotations from the book (this is a book where i felt to meet someone having the same thoughts (in a much better way) than me). (This being my translation from the italian) Nothing of which I have done, obviously, is important, but it entirely belongs to me and identifies me.A nice epitaph not a few of us would like on our graves I would believe.",
            "First ascents of all the difficult Alpine peaks, first solo winter ascent of the Matterhorn, open bivouac on K2 at 8000 metres. Bonatti climbed everything the hard way, looking for the simplest way of climbing and shunning new technology as reducing the aesthetic, detracting from the achievement. \u201cFor me, the value of a climb is the sum of three inseparable elements, all equally important: aesthetics, history, and ethics. Together they form the whole basis of my concept of alpinism. Some people see no more in climbing mountains than an escape from the harsh realities of modern times. This is not only uninformed but unfair. I don\u2019t deny that there can be an element of escapism in mountaineering, but this should never overshadow its real essence, which is not escape but victory over your own human frailty.\u201d"

            "In a word: Intense! Bonatti was among the most talented alpinists of the 20th century. He is perhaps most famous for surviving a night out in the open unscathed just below the peak of K2 during the first controversial ascent of that mountain. Yet his accomplishments stretch far beyond that. Bonatti was a pioneer of light and fast alpine style climbing, and did many of his most difficult climbs solo when such a thing was nearly unheard of. Giving up climbing at the peak of his ability at age 35, he went on to achieve even greater popular recognition as a photographer. The chapters of the book are each dedicated to different climbs. Bonnati pushed himself considerably harder with each subsequent climb. Some of his accomplishments, such as soloing the North Face of the Matterhorn during Winter seem almost inhuman. Here he shares his apprehensions, the consuming fears and loneliness he experienced, but also his extraordinary love and relationship with the mountains.  Bonatti's account of the tragic disaster at the Central Pillar of Freney is among the most moving wilderness survival writing you may ever come across. Originally a party a seven, Bonatti describes how caught in an unrelenting storm, his companions, dropped dead one by one from exhaustion and delirium. In the end only he and two others survived. Play the game for more than you can afford to lose... only then will you learn the game, is a macho quote often thrown around by mountaineers. That price is laid out soberly and very clearly here. For mountaineers there is much to learn and absorb here, this is a book full of lessons and inspiration to come back and return to time and again. For the less adventurous you cannot help but be inspired by Bonatti's adventures. His absolute dedication, perseverance, deep humanity, love and genius for his chosen craft are qualities anyone should aspire to and admire. ",
            "Well-written and extremely thrilling accounts of a selection of climbs by Bonatti. Since he made me feel as if I were on each mountain with him, there now will be no need for me to attempt those summits. Bonatti is clearly one of the best mountain climbers who ever lived.",
            "I read this book with autumn climbing trips along Europe.The historic first pants from the Alps are darling reading (always cold, hunger and snowstorm, of course).K2 and especially its postpartee will be fused to read.",
            "Bonatti is truly one of the greatest mountaineers to ever touch a rock and he manages to demonstrate this completely through his writing without coming off as haughty or vain. For example, his rope solo ascent of the Bonatti Pillar on the Dru is one of the most intense climbing passages I have ever read and is a testament to his technical expertise, boldness, brilliance on the rock, and determination. This is true of all the essays, from those detailing his ascent of K2 and Gasherbrum IV (and the farcical accusations he faced upon his descent from the former) to his treks through Patagonia (The base of the proximal phalanx of my second toe was fractured. Fortunately, it turned out to be less serious than I had feared. Once I got my swollen foot in my boot and laced it up tightly, it was possible for me to walk, and I did so for the next eighteen days.). His writing is straightforward and plain, but still conveys the splendor and thrill of the mountains (The rising moon flooded the sky with astonishingly bright light that prevented the night from growing dark, but not the spread of its infinite calm...I was drunk with solitutde and the sort of imaginings that at times lift us out of ourselves and place us where we would most wish to be.). Bonatti may come off as prickly to some given his staunchly traditional mountaineering ethics. For example, he condemns even stoppers, not to mention camming units, for protection, claiming that they, murder the impossible. He saw mountaineering as a way to come to know himself (Climb symbolized a victory of man over his own limitations more than a victory over a mountain face.) and was unwilling to undermine his standards for anyone (I could not accept just anyone on the other end of my rope, nor could I translate into money a bond that made sense, for me, only in friendship with my ropemate.). I don't like to fall into the trap of nostalgia, but Bonatti is a perfect example of what we can all aspire to as climbers and adventurers. ",
            "Me and alpinism are the perfect oxymoron. And yet I like so much reading about these kind of books in which adventure perfectly suits with wild life and danger.Bonatti was the youngest alpinist of an Italian expedition which was the first in the world to reach the top of Hymalaian K2 in 1954. At that time the success of this expedition was followed a lot by the italian mass medias and public opinion which considered the K2 conquerors like national heroes. Walter Bonatti never reached the top of K2. As a youngster, he was treated more as a local sherpa carrier than as a member of the expedition by his famous companions, Lacedelli and Compagnoni.Suddenly they abandoned him at more than 8000 metres without oxygen or explanations. Bonatti survived, but his awful experience became like a black spot to clean up in the post K2 climbing tales. Furthermore Lacedelli and Compagnoni have always rejected Bonatti's accusations.The Mountains of my life speaks about the controversial K2 episode, but has much more to offer. Reading at these pages you can feel the love, the symbiosis between Bonatti and some of the most known peaks in the world which have been all climbed by him, sometimes in unbelievable circumstances.

As Specht and Courtney persuasively demonstrate, if social work continues to drift in this direction there is good reason to expect that the profession will be entirely engulfed by psychotherapy within the next twenty years, leaving a huge gap in the provision of social services traditionally filled by social workers.

            "This would've been a much stronger book if the authors had sublimated the urge to hysteria and name-calling, and controlled their vitriolic loathing of psychotherapy. They must have sensed this because they kept announcing that they were not there to crap all over psychotherapy.... and then repeatedly crapped all over psychotherapy, while often mischaracterizing it. Reading this book reminds me of when I was vegan, and how spending time around other vegans usually made me want to run out and eat raw steak, to distance myself from such embarrassingly self-righteous, histrionic attitudes. In fact, that's part (not all) of the reason I no longer am vegan, so if I ever wind up with a private practice, you know who to blame.This book is full of uncited declarations which may well be true but which without any evidence belong more in a barroom rant than a serious book (e.g., We in the US are the most individualistic nation in the world p. 15, Most clinical social workers who seek Ph.D.s in order to hang out a shingle and call themselves 'Doctor' obtain them at institutes and universities where one can attend part time and where the research requirements are not heavy p. 100). Also, I think they exaggerate many points and seem to underestimate the harmful effects of oppression, poverty, trauma, etc. on individuals' psyches and functioning. Poor people deserve helpful interventions, and sometimes these might be based in therapeutic techniques. Just because middle-class people happen to find something enjoyable or beneficial doesn't mean poor people must be deprived of that thing. I do get their point about psychotherapy's individualism, which, like much in this book, is certainly valid but wildly overstated.That said, this book's subtitle could be Why Jessica Has Been Not Only Frustrated But Infuriated By Much of her Social Work School Experience (And Why You Should Be Too). I didn't know anything about the issue of social work and private practice when I first showed up for class, and the situation I discovered (described in this book) is astonishing. Social workers have a mandate to serve the most vulnerable and oppressed members of society, people who primarily want to do psychotherapy should do like my very best friend since Berkeley High School (c/o '97!) Lesley and go to school for that. Yes, it takes longer. It does take longer. But if Lesley can do it, why can't you?What ultimately won me over to this very flawed book was that it wasn't just about how social workers shouldn't be in private practice, it was about how social workers shouldn't be doing psychotherapy in the first place, because it's inherently incompatible with social work's mission. The problems with this book were all the more tragic, because this is a very important point, and I agree with most of the authors' arguments. I really wish I'd read this before I enrolled in social work school three years ago, because I would have chosen a different area of concentration (probably community organizing or group work), and likely had a better experience. As it was I chose casework, knowing little about the field and not realizing that I was entering training to become, quite literally, the poor man's psychotherapist. I'm not interested in psychotherapy (though unlike these authors, I feel it has a valid function and place in society), and having to study it for the past two-and-a-half years has been a source of great dismay. Sprecht and Courtney helped me to understand the unfortunate historical context for why I should really get off Bookface right now and go write this paper on CBT, even though I really don't want to.This book is a bit dated, being published in 1994 on the cusp of changes (e.g., in psychopharmacology) that had a giant impact on the mental health industry. I'd be interested in an updated edition by someone else (Sprecht has since died) revisiting these hugely important issues in a more responsible tone.",
            "I hate this bookThis book is binary in it's approach to individual vs community interventions and only sees the latter as valuable. It's rife with factual errors, bias, and ultimately just very belittling. It's diametrically opposed to the idea that people in school for this profession should be able to pay back their student loans or make time for their own families by finding stable employment. The authors bash the hell out of psychotherapy and deem it to be useless or pseudoscientific and espouse ideals of their own as widely accepted societal standards for morality and relationships. They continuously state that things like therapy are good for middle class and wealthy people so they cant be for anyone else and completely ignore the idea that social workers are in a unique position to individually support clients in accessing the larger community and community based services. ",
            "As an undergrad social work student, I found the ideas at times thought-provoking and painful to consider. I applaud the authors for trying to shock us into seeing that the current direction of the profession has ironically caused us to neglect the disadvantaged and vulnerable, the exact population so many of us started out on this journey to help.",
            "No doubt this is an important book for social workers. However, to say that the author\u2019s analysis is \u201cheavy-handed\u201d is too generous. As other reviews have pointed out, there is a lot of ham-fisted anti-therapy analysis in there that just doesn\u2019t hold up. It is true of course that individual therapy cannot address the social problems that social workers are meant to, but it is also true that individual therapy is sometimes a great help to our vulnerable populations. Also, I couldn\u2019t help but roll my eyes a little at the implications that (1) the problems of social work are mostly due to social workers wanting higher pay and more professional autonomy (as though we should just agree to being poor and taking our orders from management that doesn\u2019t care or understand what we are dealing with), and (2) somehow the solution to this is also to provide case management to well-off working class and wealthy people. Like, c\u2019mon, that last part does not jive with the spirit of this text. However, the author is a social worker, not a philosopher, so I won\u2019t hold him too accountable for his argument. Overall I agreed with the premise of this book and feel sad that as a young social worker, I did not hear this sort of argument in graduate school, or anywhere really. I had to look for it myself and it is an important argument. I guess what I would say is this: taken as a primary source on the history and philosophy of social work, this is an important book, and well worth the read."

            "Recently I\u2019ve realized that I\u2019m something of a self-hating social worker. I often feel ashamed of my professed humanitarian goals when I catch myself in my most honest moments of ambitious career advancement, or when I am having a particularly difficult time identifying with clients from radically different backgrounds than myself. That, and I recently got a part-time job in the private sector. I\u2019d gotten a fire in my belly read something professionally self-deprecating, something that would remind me of just how much shit I\u2019m full of. Enter Specht &amp, Courtney. It was delightful to find companionship in their most radical of assertions: social work has become a field of upwardly mobile members of the middle-class that are too preoccupied with social elevation to be of any genuine utility to social justice. They put simple words to the most indescribable complexities that taunt my professional life and mock my inflated sense of professional importance. It wasn\u2019t all cotton candy and sunshine, though (which now seems like an inappropriate turn of phrase, what with the self-loathing and all). Given the polarizing title and hype of the book being \u201cprovocative and controversial,\u201d the majority of its content is quite dry. It\u2019s not a long book by most standards, and it felt like most of it was spent recounting a history of social work and its major players. Despite so many words dedicated to historical context, it seems like the book was mostly written with a social worker audience in mind, as the authors seem to assume some level a priori content knowledge (e.g. Carl Rogers is first referred to as \u201cRogers\u201d with no accompanying biography). Reading Unfaithful Angels is frustrating at times due simply to shoddy writing, an unfortunate aspect that plagues the field as a whole by my estimation. The paragraphs at times lack cohesion, with the writers sometimes connecting unrelated concepts together or even flat out contradicting the beginning of a paragraph with the ending. For example, in the discussion of social workers\u2019 proclivity toward psychiatry on pages 94-95, it\u2019s difficult for me to understand if they are saying that social workers were more or less likely to support psychiatry than physicians of the time. Specht &amp, Courtney also have a tendency to go off on tangents regarding information that is related but not all that important to the central theses (i.e. notions of self-esteem in the context of the efficacy of psychotherapy). Maybe they just needed a better editor. Maybe they just needed to be more comfortable with an even shorter book. The latter part of the book was that which I enjoyed the most. Specht &amp, Courtney strike a much more headstrong and critical note in opposition to the trend toward psychotherapy as the primary social work practice modality. They argue that the field should focus more on helping people to build more supportive social networks and environments. They rail at psychotherapy\u2019s and psychoanalysis\u2019s sense of unearned entitlement, as well as it\u2019s judgmental, outdated, and often incorrect assumption that the individual ought to be the level of intervention in the majority of cases. We too seldom ask ourselves in the profession who psychotherapy is really for and who really benefits from its perpetuation as the primary \u201ccure\u201d to social ails. We do not interrogate it as a means of making people dependent upon ourselves, the ordained and privileged few with access to the divine knowledge of the human psyche. Even our client-centered, collaborative approaches lose legitimacy when such services become mandated due to involvement with the welfare state or justice system. Some other readers have commented that they were encouraged or elected to read this book as part of their college education in social work. I could not agree more. Though difficult to follow at times, Specht &amp, Courtney\u2019s perspective is just as welcome and relevant today (if not more so) as it was when they first penned Unfaithful Angels.",
            "This is an excellent exploration of how the social work profession, in its drive to be seen as legitimate and move towards therapeutic approaches, have located social problems within individuals and families (rather than in social systems) and largely diverted itself from its radical and community change roots. Highly recommend this to folks!",
            "More and more clinical social workers are moving away from social service roles into private therapy practices, where they counsel middle-class clients. In the view of the authors of this book, this is a betrayal of the entire driving force behind social work as a profession. Social work is supposed to be about empowering communities and helping people access supports around them, while individual psychotherapy is focused on making one person at a time feel better.The book delves into the historical tensions between social workers and psychiatrists, and the middle-class snobbery that has been with the profession from its earliest years. Since I'm about to enter a social work program, and am planning to specialize in mental health counseling, this was an essential read--though it left me with more questions than answers."

            "If I'm going to rag on guys like Grisham for having a formula for what they write, then I suppose I ought to do so for Piers Anthony, as well, Harpy Thyme, as the 17th book in the Xanth series, is enjoyable enough, but the parts that make it fun are the parts that don't feel like they've been done 16 times before.In Harpy Thyme, Gloha the winged Goblin-Harpy crossbreed sets out to find true love, and begins with (of course) a trip to the Good Magician. That was also the inception of the plot for at least 1, and possibly 2, other Xanth stories. Once she gets to the Good Magician, she is told that rather than do her year's service, she should go see Humfrey's first son. This, too, has become commonplace for Anthony: the Good Magician doesn't actually require a year's service of any of the questioners who are the stars of the books, in this case, though, it makes little sense to not require the service because in fact he has answered her question -- so Gloha, who is not a Magician (usually exempt from the service) and who performs no other task for Humfrey (another way of getting out of the service) simply gets an answer that she doesn't have to pay for.So Gloha sets off to find Humfrey's first son, and there is a rather pointless (but possibly meant to be charming?) series of visits as she goes to one more-or-less random person after another to try to find out who Humfrey's son might be, before she literally just sort of stumbles across him. The SPOILER ALERT son turns out to be Crombie, which readers might have known, I can't remember if that was mentioned in an earlier Xanth novel.Gloha asks Crombie to use his talent for finding things to point to the direction of her dream man, he does, and she then sets out with Magician Trent, who is youth-potioned for this story. From there the story takes the typical sort of Xanthian twists and turns, all of it very familiar by now to anyone who has read the previous 16 books.As I said, it's enjoyable enough, I use the Xanth books as filler and I was reading this one while I was tremendously busy and also a bit under the weather, so I didn't mind that it was simple, but it would be nice to see Anthony spread his storytelling wings a bit more with the Xanth books. As I was reading it I kept thinking of the really good Xanth books: Night Mare and Crewel Lye are two of the best, and Castle Roogna also a great one, and none of them really follow the same pattern as what has come to be the typical Xanth storyline: a person sets out with a question for the Good Magician, only to get a nonanswer of sorts, and then work through the question him- or herself on the course of fulfilling the seemingly nonsensical task Humfrey has given them.The book did flesh out and elaborate on some characters, the demon Metria expands as a character, and Trent becomes a bit more human than he was in the first 2 or 3 novels, where he barely appeared, so there's that (we get to know Trent's Mundanian history, a bit, and it turns out he was friends in some way with Van Gogh, a detail about which I can make up my mind: interesting? or too much?) The puns are good, as always, but overall the story was only a middle-of-the-road Xanth book, not one of the great ones, not one of the bad ones, either.A couple of things that particularly stood out as minor annoyances: there was a sequence in the book where two people, I believe meant to be from Mundania, were stumbled upon and put in touch with each other, and it all had the feel of some sort of inside joke or Easter egg type thing, but since the book is almost 25 years old, it was nearly impossible to even make sense of the joke, and it threw me out of the story for a bit.Also, Anthony is replaying entirely too many bits from earlier books: we get another round of the Curse Fiends force someone to put on a play, and the whole we have to put on a play to get past this challenge thing is really a Xanth trope by now. The whole thing with Crombie and Humfrey was just a throwaway: Crombie was always a fascinating character: a soldier, woman-hater who married a nymph and had had a secret demon girlfriend growing up, Crombie (we're told) hates his father, Humfrey, for how he treated him -- but the two become instant friends again just right smack out of nowhere. Then the story drops them entirely. And, there were a couple of things that made it seem as if the idea behind the book had changed. For example, the title: at points in the story, there were mentions of the thyme plant as it exists in Xanth -- slowing down time for people -- but they never connected up to make it really Harpy Thyme in any way, and Gloha isn't actually a harpy, there were some madness-inspired flashbacks that talked about some sort of cave Gloha found that was filled with artifacts and she had to be rescued, but that never went anywhere, either, they were just sort of thrown in there. All of Anthony's other titles for the books ultimately made sense once you read the book (Crewel Lye for example was the way they cleaned the Roogna tapestry to see Jordan The Barbarian's story). This title just felt like it was unrelated entirelySome things that worked well, though, were the crushes on Trent that both Gloha and a winged centaur Trent transformed 70 years ago had, and Trent's reaction to them, and the final scenes when Gloha and the others have to storm up Mount Pin-A-Tuba (for reasons related to the plot that I won't disclose) are actually pretty exciting.Overall, the book was a C+, and if it was my introduction to Xanth it probably wouldn't have been strong enough to keep me reading. Then again, who starts a series at book 17? Anthony is lucky that any reader who made it this far is probably like me: willing to forgive the weaker stories in hopes that the full magic will be restored, as it were. The first 8 books were really strong, but of books 9-17, only Man From Mundania stands out, although both Harpy Thyme and Demons Don't Dream had their merits. I still plan on finishing all of the Xanth books eventually, a man's gotta have goals. I just hope that in the upcoming 19-already-written (and apparently 7 more planned) Anthony tries to recapture the best of the Xanth writing, instead of just churning out more of these.Briane Pagel is the author of Codes, and blogs at Thinking The Lions.",
            "This was like any Xanth novel: a quest filled with innumerable puns. Gloha was a harpy goblin and lonely since she was the only one of her type. She wants to find out about the adult conspiracy, a joke that has been done to death in pretty much all the Xanth books. Naturally others recognize the answer to her quest before she does. This book brought King Trent back which was fun. He more or less manages her quest. I do like the answer to the quest. That answer is pretty sweet. Lots of fun, which I really needed with the Covid19 pandemic, and quite forgettable also like most Xanth books. Recommended for those trying to read all of this series. February 2021: Since I honestly cannot remember the story, I am lowering this to 2 stars. It simply can't have been good if I can't remember anything about it.",
            "This is the seventeenth glorious Xanth book in this series, and we again encounter someone who really needs a mate!!! Gloha is the only being of her kind in all of Xanth, the wondrous offspring of a mating between a harpy and goblin. And as she grew she often wondered if, when and where the one being she would find to love and to love her. So, as always, it's off to Good Magician Humfrey!!! Natch! In a quest for her true love she is thrust into perilous quest of puns and danger aplenty in search of love, friendship, and as always, happiness. Xanth will forever serve up a hilarious milieu of puntastic adventures and this is no holds barred different! Enjoy!",
            "This is the 17th book in the pun-filled Xanth series by Piers Anthony. Like all the books in this series, the main characters travel to the good magician Humphrey to get an answer to a question. Humphrey usually charges a year of services as the price for his answer but he always finds a way for the main characters to do some deed for Xanth instead of serving Humphrey for a year.In this particular book, the female character is Gloha a goblin crossbreed who is looking for a mate. Joining Gloha on her quest for love is a winged centaur filly named Cynthia, a beloved character from earlier books King Trent, and Graeboe who is a giant. Along the way, they interact with several other characters.First of all, if you can't stand puns, then don't even attempt to read any books in this series. Second, if you're looking for an in-depth fantasy novel with lots of plots...you might want to look elsewhere. While Xanth is (so far) a series of 42 books it is NOT the Wheel of Time Series or any other involved fantasy series. These books are light-hearted, whimsical, and funny. They are meant for entertainment and can be read in a day or two. You do not have to read the series in order although that does help when characters from other books in the series show up. :)",
            "When I found this book I was so excited because I had loved the Xanth years ago when I read every book up to this point. Also, I have grown up quite a bit and some of Xanth humor is uncomfortable for me now.So when I first started this book, I almost put it back down. But I persisted.I really like Gloha.I wanted to see who her true love would be. So I trudged through all the silly sex jokes and adjectives for girls, and once I was in the meat of the story I didn't even notice them.When Cynthia, Trent and Gloha were adventuring I could not figure out who would be her true love. It had to be someone in the story and Trent was already married.Then enter Marrow, Demetrius, and Graeboe. I still didn't see it. But I was happy in the adventure.It wasn't until the nymphs were lost until I saw where it was going. And then I was like huh? How is that going to work? How could they summon the stork?Well it all works out and it proves that under all the puns and innuendos, Piers Anthony is a great storyteller.",
            "Xanth is a fantasy novel that is based almost entirely on wordplay, specifically puns. The series occupies a strange space between silly and weird. Anthony has some odd opinions on themes, such as sex, racism, prejudice, growing up, and the use of magic in everyday life. The writing vacillates between heavy-handed condescending to extended analysis of magic, science, and the application of the rules of Xanth. Some love it, some hate it, I personally thought it was a strange read but harmless, although I doubt I'll read each book twice. One thing about Anthony, he has a very complicated history and genealogy of Xanth and its characters and you have to appreciate how he always finds ways to connect them from book to book."

            "Death in Four Courses is the second installment in the Key West Food Critic Mystery Series and I devoured it in one afternoon. Haley Snow is happily working for Key Zest Magazine as it's newest Food Critic. She should be on Cloud 9, but the magazine's owner, the sister of the dead woman from the debut novel, is looking for any excuse to fire Hayley. And her mother, Janet Snow, has just arrived to attend the Key West Literary Festival with her. No pressure, then. Hayley will get morsels of gossip and hopefully an exclusive interview with one of the giants in the Food writing industry...hopefully. And there are the mandatory restaurant review. Everything seems to be going well until Hayley finds the Festival's Key Note Speaker in a small decorative pond, not breathing. When the KWPD zeroes in on one of her best friends, both Hayley and her mother start sniffing around to out the real killer. I love Hayley who is pleasantly similar to her mother. I can still see them tooling around on the Island on their scooters. The city and Island are again a character in the novel, and I fell in love yet again with the Island I often visited when I lived in Fort Lauderdale. Hayley still jabbers away when she gets nervous and her weight still bothers her, but she's grown as a character. I'll definitely read the next in the series! ",
            "Everything is for sale in Key West - for the right price. Hayley Snow is a local food critic in Key West for the magazine Key Zest, and she is barely hanging on to her job after the events in the second book of the series, Topped Chef. Her mother, a fabulous chef of the past, has decided to join her for her first food seminar which adds an element of anxiety to prove herself to not only her job, but also her mother.This novel takes us through twists and turns and a few homicides of key persons at the seminar, in which Hayley becomes an initial person of interest, and later an unofficial investigator as one of her best friends is arrested for the murder. We are also given a taste of the mysterious Detective Nate Bransford and their newly budding interest in one another. The title alone of this book made me hungry, and there was no lack of amazing food throughout the book. The detailed description of the courses that were either prepared or eaten made my imagination want to take a trip to Key West. I appreciate some of the key recipes being featured in the back of the book!The book was well written as I did not feel out of place for starting on book 3 and not book 1. Anyone with a love for food, mystery or cozy mystery novels will thoroughly enjoy this book. I look forward to enjoying the other books in this series. ",
            "This is the 2nd book in the Key West Food Critic Mystery and it was just as good as the first one. Haley goes to a literary conference where food writing authors are participants. Hayley's mom comes to visit and to go to the conference also. Everything is going great until Hayley discovers the restaurant critic and keynote speaker Jonah Barrows' body in a dipping pool and when her best friend, Eric is arrested for the murder Hayley and her mom decided to do their own sleuthing. The characters are all well-developed and she added a couple of new characters (though probably not permanent) to this book. The one thing I like about this series is there are always several suspects and you really don't know until the end who the killer is. Keeps you on your toes. Great writing, fantastic description of the Key West area and especially the local people. Highly recommended series. I'm ready for book 3. ",
            "Hayley Snow is thrilled with her new job as a food writer for Key Zest magazine. When a literary conference comes to Key West, she knows some of the most famous food writers will be in attendance. She buys herself tickets, as well as treating her mother to the conference as well, and giving her a chance to visit. On the first night of the conference, Hayley finds the body of Jonah Barrows, the keynote speaker and one of the most well-known authors there. Next, one of her dear friends, who is not even attending the conference, is arrested for the murder. So now it's up to Hayley and her mother to figure out just who is responsible among the other attendees. This series is entertaining. Hayley is someone who is excited about her job, but also insecure about her abilities, and worried that the woman who is co-owner of the magazine (and who does not like Hayley) is going to have her fired at any minute. There are also some really interesting descriptions of Key West and places there, which is also fun to read (as someone who has never visited). I'll look for another one of this series.",
            "Hayley Snow is enjoying her new job as the food critic for Key Zest magazine in Key West, Florida. Her new assignment sounds exciting because she's going to attend a literary conference of food writers. She's excited and a little apprehensive because her mom's coming from New Jersey to attend with her. But when the popular controversial guest speaker winds up dead in a decorative pool, her mom's help causes it's own problems, and once again, Hayley gets caught up in a stew of deadly suspects. Chapter headings of quotes authors have used about food are fascinating. The characters continue to grow more interesting as we learn more and more about them in this second Key West Food Critic mystery. The inner workings of cookbook authors adds another dimension to this story with clues that send the reader in many directions. Might as well make one of the tasty recipes included in the book, like the Hot Fudge Pie, because the food descriptions will send you seeking something equally luscious to snack upon while you read this foodie mystery.

And mom is visiting....what else can go wrong?The series continues to build characters in installment 2, and we also continue to work on a possible romantic interest with the police detective. All in all, well done. Recipes at the end, and the chocolate pie looks super!"

And there is quite a bit of snouts and entrails in this collection, depending on how the reader considers the racially charged/incendiary Black Canaan and Moon of Zambebwei.Both stories hang their tension on fear of the Other, here being the rural African-Americans, the descendants of plantation slaves, who are considered to be a bare step up from the primitive circumstances of their ancestors, reverting to blood worship and violence when exposed to mystic forces or charismatic rabble-rousers. A weak and lesser people without real agency.The publisher included a 'fold out color poster', all of about 12 inches by 6, of the cover art (from People of the Black Coast).

He only sold three of them before his death, all to Weird Tales, the rest were sold by his estate in the late '60's and early '70's when Conan was taking off in popular society. There's a surprisingly honest and heart-felt introduction by Gahan Wilson, and my Berkley edition has a blurb on the cover that says: Illustrated * Full Color Fold-Out Poster Inside, but they neglect to identify the artist, Ken Kelly. ",
            "This is sort of a collection of Howard's b-sides, lesser known stories for the completist (or so says Gahan Wilson in the prologue). Already being a Howard fan, it was an interesting read.tRight off the bat, some of these stories (including the title story) had huge and obvious problems. Many of which have a promising setup and then abruptly end, like \u201cDermod's Bane\u201d, which is almost a fragment. \u201cPeople of the Black Coast\u201d (which is illustrated on the cover and fold-in poster), starts to unroll a Lovecraftian flavor before descending into a sort-of weird montage. Both \u201cDelenda Est\u201d and \u201cThe Cobra in the Dream\u201d are partly guilty of the same issue. tAs always, Howard's writing is amazingly energetic, pumping straight dramatic power right into your face, so that tends to steam over any problems the stories have. The problem is that his stuff is so good that you want more of it. \u201cThe Haunter in the Ring\u201d has a lot of great stuff in it, and I was totally along for the ride, but it dropped me off a little too soon (serious, I would read a whole novella of that). \u201cThe Noseless Horror\u201d has a lot of fun bits in it, but skimps on some important stuff and I can't quite get over the unfortunate title. t\u201cMoon of Zambebwei\u201d (which I'd read previously as \u201cGrizzly Horror\u201d) and \u201cThe Dwellers Under the Tombs\u201d are both straight up awesome and really left me with no complaints. \u201cThe House in the Oaks\u201d is almost there, but I think the repair job by August Derleth might impair it slightly. tI've read and reviewed that title story before... It got high marks from no less a writer than H.P. Lovecraft, and one can see why. It's not Howard's best stuff, and it wallows a too deeply in that old racial quagmire. tStill, the collection on the whole was well worthwile.",
            "Good collection of stories. Black Canaan is a favorite of mine. I have some doubts that REH would have finished The House with the suicide of John Conrad, but it is a Lovecraftian ending (Augest Derleth finished the REH fragment in this volume).",

            "Report, Decker said, cutting straight to business.Masada reached behind his ear as if to scratch, then gave an almost absentminded tug on his ponytail as he straightened and pivoted toward Decker. We were running a routine gene-sequence scan on the biosamples froom Ravanar IV, he said. Most were nothing to write home about. He geestured for Takeshewada to look at the sensor data for herself. Then we found this.Decker tried to be patient, but at times like this it was hard. Guillermo, please don't keep me in suspense.Sorry, sir. It's a gene sequence unlike anything we've ever seen before. My best uess would be that it has several million chemical base pairs, and it's more complex than simple G-A-T-C. It has molecules we're still trying to identify.Takeshewada lifted her gaze from the blue-gray sensor hood. Her already fair complexion looke paler than normal. That's incredible, she said.Folding his arms across his chest, Decker said to Masada, Where did it come from? Some kind of uber-life-form?Hardly, the science officer said. From a simple mold.Simple? Decker shook his head, as much in disbelief as in sheer wonderment at the never-ending tricks the universe had up its proverbial sleeve. That's a lot of DNA for something I'd scrape off my breakfast. Speaking of which-- He turned toward his yeoman, who happened to be walking past. Lawford, get me some coffee, will you?Lawford transferred to the Yorktown two weeks ago, sir, the yeoman said. I'm Guthrie.Decker squinted in disapproval. And that has precisely what to do with my coffee?Nothing, sir.The commodore pointed the yeoman toward the food slot. Milk, no sugar.I know, sir.Thanks, Lawford.Guthrie, sir.Whatever. Decker turned back toward the science station while the yeoman plodded away, muttering quietly. Returning his attention to Masada, Decker said, Why would mold need that much genetic information?I don't think it does, Masada said.Decker was getting annoyed. That's what I'm saying.No sir, Masada said. What I mean is, I think only a very small portion of the genetic string has anything to do with the mold itself. The rest is...well, just there.Takeshewada tilted her head in a way that implied she found Masada's answer less than satisfactory. But what does it do, Guillermo?The science officer's eyes widened as his lips tightened into a thin line and his shoulders rounded into a shrug. No idea. I can tell you that it's big, but other than that... He just shook his head.And out tradition of excellence continues, Decker said with a sour inflection. His darkening mood was brightened by the arrival of his coffee. He accepted the mug from Guthrie, then turned immediately back toward Masada. How soon can you finish some testsand get me a real report?I'm not sure I can, Masada said. Our lab's good, bu it's not this good. We're gonna have to send all of this--the samples, the scans, the whole kit and kaboodle--back to Starfleet Command and let them handle it.Decker's shoulders slumped with disappointment. Are you serious? We make a once-in-a-lifetime find, and you're telling me we have to punt?I'm afraid so so, sir"

            "This second volume in the Vanguard series is not written by David Mack, and Dayton Ward and Kevin Dilmore aren't quite as good authors. It's not a night-and-day difference in style or execution but Harbinger Star Trek Vanguard 1 is the better book.Biggest highlight:* The authors do a good job of showing the difference between how the Klingons react to the Shedai Wanderer and the Federation's response. They have no problems bombarding planets with photon torpedoes but the Federation's attempt to understand what's happening reaps greater rewards in the end.Less good things:* Why is it that in these shared-world series, it seems authors feel compelled to include every character or race introduced in other books. I noticed this during my Star Wars novel phase - Every book had to include every character from the original films, no matter how much of a stretch required. Here, we get a Romulan ship investigating the Reach. Now, I love the Romulans (Balance of Terror is in my top 5 TOS episodes) but there's no reason for their presence here.* There's an ill-considered attempt at humor when Quinn and Pennington are sent to pick up one of Ganz's operatives who has a pet alien named Sniffy - do I need to elaborate?* While the attempt to create a truly alien race in the Tholians continues apace, I wish that all their names didn't end in -ene. It's nearly as bad, of course, with Vulcans or the other races.* Out of nowhere we find that T'Prynn knows Sandesjo is a Klingon spy and, beyond that, we find that Sandesjo is working as a double agent. Huh? When did this happen? And from a narrative point of view, there's absolutely no tension anymore about Sandesjo's role in the Federaton embassy or the threat of discovery.* What's worse? The Vulcan/Klingon lesbian sex is only implied in this installment :-( I'm still not particularly interested in any of the characters but the storyline and the writing continue to be good enough that I want to reach closure with the series. Mack is the author of the third book - Reap the Whirlwind Star Trek Vanguard 3 - and that's in the mail and I have the last two books out from the library so my desires should be fulfilled relatively soon.",
            "SUMMON THE THUNDER is okay. I enjoyed it but I can't say I quite got the meal I was looking for out of this volume. Weirdly, I think it may have to do with the fact I was eager to get back into the character journeys of the vividly realized cast from HARBINGER but instead got a focus on the plot. The characters, however amusing Quinn and Pennington kidnapping a mob accountant may be, didn't seem to progress much in the story. It says something I was more interested in the relationship of a Romulan commander and her subordinate than I was in the explosion of a planet midway through the book. Really, the best part of the book was the Romulan and Ambassadorial sections that seemed the most removed from the main cast. We get some information about the Tholians, the big threat, and some more but it does seem to be not as much happened character wise as I'd hoped.Still, I'm not turned off the series either.6.5/10",
            "What Ward and Dayton do best is move an intricate plot forward with continuous interpersonal conflicts in an unfolding mystery about a newly discovered alien race. Its what I like most about Star Trek, the discovery of new life forms and civilizations. But I have a problem with this story. I don't care enough about any of the characters that Mack (in the first book) and Ward (in this book) have crafted to feel much of anything when they die or lose someone they care about. The authors hop around a lot, creating quirky characters that gradually push a lumbering series of side stories, yet I never really get to know them.Now that I've finished books 1 and 2 of the series, I am asking myself the following: Where the heck did Spock and Kirk go? (they had cameos in the first book and disappear in the second book). Will I read the next book in this Vanguard series? Even in Game of Thrones, which has a massive amount of characters, I feel something for Tyrion, Arya, John Snow, and the Mother of Dragons, even though I struggle to keep track of all the extra characters and sub-plots. With the first 2 books in the Vanguard series, the characters are a little wooden to me and the jokes are predictable. They seem more like vehicles to push along the interests of their species rather than breathing, bleeding beings. I do see Ward and Mack as talented writers who had a hand in shaping the greater story arc of Vanguard (greater emphasis on Mack as he oversaw nearly all of the series). I also understand the desire of an author to craft their own characters and the thrill to be the ones to expand the Star Trek universe. But I think the story could have been more engaging to me if either Spock or Kirk were given significant parts in this space opera since none of the new characters seemed to grab me. In Book 1, the brief interplay of Spock and T'Prynn as two Vulcans could have gone a long way. Kirk lacked action in the first book, but he could have livened up the slow parts with some gutsy Kirk-ness in this second book. This might have given more runway to the other characters to deepen in their development. The story line was interesting enough for me to wish that these things could have happened. But 800+ pages later (Books 1 &amp,2), I'm not sure I will get to the next Vanguard books. Too many great series out there in the Sci Fi and Fantasy realms. If anyone has read book 3, please comment your thoughts below.Pick up this book if you are a Trekkie that is not attached to seeing established characters from the Trek backbone and just want an intriguing mystery about different species on the edge of war.",
            "This is the second book in the Vanguard series. The series is set in the Taurus Reach, with the Federation trying to examine clues to a discovered meta genome, while also navigating Tholian and Klingon activity, which happens to border this region of space. It does a good job moving the story along. To me, this book felt it could have been a solid stand-alone Star Trek episode. Compared to the first entry, this one could feel a little slow at times. I think it was down to the writing style of the authors (David Mack wrote the first entry). It was good to see the Endeavor in action, a Constitution class ship that was only mentioned in the previous novel. The characters there are compelling and I cannot wait to follow up with them in future installments. I like how the story also carries on with Pennington, the reporter, and Quinn, a universal drunk. Their adventure helps shed light on the universe outside of the Federation. I did not find that their story arcs clashed with the Federation counterparts. I'm looking forward to see how their story threads intertwine in future installments.The story does a good job answering a few questions from the first book. The problem is that one answer always brings up 100 more questions. A major problem with the book is the ending, which seemed to go on and on. All of this was to set up for the third installment. So while this was necessary, I cannot help but feel that there could have been ways to shorten it, or to make it a bit more entertaining. The surprise turns at this point seemed a little predictable. Overall, a good book for the series, which is starting off strong! ",
            "Dayton Ward does his best David Mack impression and the results are entertaining and enjoyable. The humour and variety don't quite hit the spot quite as well but we get plenty of setup here and the Vanguard series wheels keep spinning along quite nicely. I'm continuing to enjoy the vast range of characters, the overt liberalness that tinges this particular Star Trek, the classic warmongering (and the Romulans make their entrance in a sneaky fashion this time around) and the pure - albeit generic - space operaness of it all. It's a lot of fun, though perhaps difficult to recommend beyond the pure entertainment value.I did, also, enjoy the little nod to the lack of Klingon makeup in TOS explaining it away as a bastard race, lacking the honour of the classic klingon - indeed, the Klingons on the show are particularly masochistic. Not a whiff of Kirk makes me sad, though.If you enjoyed Harbinger, there's no reason you wouldn't enjoy this continuation since the quality doesn't dip. Be aware that it's a little thin on the ground story-wise though, I think David Mack probably wanted to keep the big moments in the series for himself.",
            "While continuing the main story and doing good development on it. I think this books centers too much on overexposition and lessens the mistery. It also has some deep incursions into repetitive instances of inner thoughts, and while the repetition works to a certain extent, it could have been done with far less instances with the same or greater effect. It also leaves suggested but unresolved what is perhaps one of the perhaps more pivotal points in star trek. This might be the place where the klingons get romulan technology, or it might not be. But it's completely unresolved. And while there are better clifhangers open, some things you just don't play with. ",
            "Even though it took me over a month to read it, it wasn't due lack if quality, I just couldn't find the time. But I thought it was a great follow to Harbinger, not as good as Harbinger but still a solid entry. The Shedai scenes &amp, the character building was great. l think the overall Vanguard story is awsome, it's a little unpredictable as it seems the traditional Star Trek rules don't apply, people die regardless of rank or status,...fixin to jump right into Reap the Whirlwind! Loving this Vanguard series!",
            "The second volume is as enjoyable and well written as the first. I'm enjoying the journey of this story very much, I'm just hoping that by the end, the secret of Taurus Reach will be worthy. Great characters and storyline so far."

            "When I started 52 Vol 4 I was ever-so-slightly fatigued. This isn\u2019t too surprising, considering that the 52 story is told in real time over 52 weeks (one year). Compressing a year\u2019s worth of story into a little more than a week might not necessarily be the best way to go about reading this... On the other hand, it\u2019s so very addictive!I\u2019ve re-read the whole of 52 as part of my 2014 graphic novel binge. Volume 4 obviously concludes the saga with weeks 40 through 52.The writers pull a number of surprises as the individual storylines wrap up. That said, I struggled to keep up with the very last issue (week 52), what with all the time-travelling and the multiverse. Hang on: wasn\u2019t the whole idea of Crisis on Infinite Earths to get rid of this kind of thing? I loved the Booster Gold story throughout, but I was hanging on by my fingertips right there at the end (it probably didn\u2019t help that I read this bit late at night). The most provocative story here is obviously the one concerning Black Adam. Driven insane by grief and rage after the death of Isis (his wife) and Osiris, he goes on a killing spree that is known in the DC Universe as World War III. The story is also chronicled in World War III, which was published at the same time, and provides a lot more detail. It\u2019s a fascinating study, considering that Adam\u2019s power level is comparable with that of Superman (Alpha level). World War III shows the amount of carnage such a character could cause without restraint. And yes, it\u2019s appalling. It becomes more interesting if you compare his loss to that of Ralph Dibny, who lost his wife in Identity Crisis and spends most of 52 trying, not only to come to terms with it, but to resurrect her in some way. It was always clear this wasn\u2019t going to end well (for both these characters), but I couldn\u2019t help but feel pity for Adam, given the fact that he was set up and intentionally provoked to destabilize the world\u2019s balance of power (yes \u2013 entire nations go to war against him)\u2026 and just when he was pulling his act together. I\u2019ll be reviewing the World War III collection separately.\u2026and Mogo makes a cool (if very fleeting) appearance (I\u2019ve always loved the idea of a sentient planet being a Green Lantern) in the Adam Strange / Starfire / Animal Man sequence. Interestingly, this sequence even spawned a spin-off series called Countdown to Adventure.In closing: 52 really has to be read as a whole to be able to form any kind of opinion. It\u2019s a massive story that hangs together despite a great number of moving parts. I\u2019m not sure how much of what happens here is considered canon, especially with the New 52 \u201creboot\u201d, but I\u2019d still recommend it highly.Vol 4 \u2013 best bit no 2: Mogo \u201cmaking the catch\u201d!Vol 4 \u2013 best bit no 1: Black Adam going off the rails and totalling everything in his path!Next and finally: World War III",
            "THE SERIESThis tale follows a \u201cmissing year\u201d in the DC Universe after the groundbreaking \u201cInfinite Crisis\u201d story (see my review for that one) which was one of the bestselling graphic novels for the 2006 year. Note that Final Crisis follows after this and was published in 2009.52 asks the questions who takes the role of the most popular superheroes (Batman, Superman and Wonder Woman) when they step down from their roles? There are a list of vying superheroes trying to make a name for themselves but everybody especially feels the lack of Superman in Metropolis. Meanwhile, it should be no surprise that the aftershocks of Final Crisis are far from resolved. Expect old and new villains, as well as some villains who have not been seen in some time.Each chapter has a page of commentary from the writers and artists as well as a page or half page of script. The back has various art covers.The writing team has to produce 52 issues in 52 weeks! That must have been intense. That writing team was: Greg Rucka, Mark Waid, Keith Giffen, Grant Morrison and Geoff Johns. Artwork and such by (listing only some of them): Joe Bennett, Chris Batista and Ruy Jose.Note that this series comes in four volumes. VOLUME FOURAnd it all comes to a close in this volume revealing what \u201c52\u201d means in the series. See spoilers below.Luthor and John Henry go at it and Luthor isn't as smart as I thought.Those space dweebs make it back, Monotoya meets Princess Diana, Ralph Dinby figures more of the puzzle out and appearance by Mogo of the Green Lantern Corps. Ralph Dibny shows us why he's one of the greatest detectives and some won't like the ending.Black Adam suffers tragedies in his family and goes on a violent rampage that gets him into trouble with everybody, including the nerd scientists but Doctor Sivana is happy to see him.Several scenes can't be mentioned as they are spoilers. Onward . . . Bruce Wayne makes a short appearance and the Bat Family gets involved in some Gotham matters. Captain Marvel cleverly fools Black Adam.And then the big finale but I can't say much as its massive spoilers.A very nice conclusion to the series.ARTWORK PRESENTATION: B plus, STORY/PLOTTING: B plus to A minus, CHARACTERS/DIALOGUE: B to B plus, DC MYTHOLOGY: B plus to A minus, ACTION SCENES: B to B plus, OVERALL GRADE: B plus, WHEN READ: end of October 2012.SPOILERS: Too bad Luthor came across as a dumb in this volume. I felt they shafted a guy who is supposed to be an ultra-genius but whatever.It was nice to see some of these superheroes die since it's supposed to be dangerous. Sorry, Ralph.So 52 is parallel universes to our own with stories and focuses of their own that are different for the superheroes (Superman is a Nazi in one, KINGDOME COME is another version, Luthor and his descendants are superheroes compared to the evil JLA). It was nice to see the various panels of all of these different Earths, especially the ones that have been used before in the DC world.You all know that Black Adam will eventually figure out the changed password to become Black Adam, right? There's no way that character is gone for good from the DC world and there's always the alternate Earths.",
            "The 52 project was so huge that I didn't feel like I could give a decent review after any given volume. How to review what is, really, just a small part of a much bigger story? Now that I've finished all 52 issues, I can give a sort of post-mortem. There are so many storylines, and so much to wrap up, that the last 13 issues had huge events nearly every other issue. It certainly kept me reading. This was the only one of the 52 trades that I read all in one sitting. For the most part, I was pretty satisfied with how the various storylines wrapped up. Sad about how Black Adam's had to end up, but I suppose it was inevitable. Renee's character arc was probably the most satisfying. The important thing is that the writing was actually quite strong throughout. The art also remained pretty good, in a fairly uniform style. Ok, it wasn't really anything earth-shattering from an aesthetic standpoint, but it did a hell of a job telling the story. Even better were the covers. Some really fine work there, with great, iconic images and a handful of really unique and interesting covers. Sadly, they were only printed in wee thumbnails in each trade, probably to help sell the 52 covers collection. I would have much rather had them reproduced full size in the trade. Oh, and here's a great reason to buy the trades instead of the individual comics, covers aside: after each issue there would be a brief commentary from at least one person on the creative team. I love this stuff, especially when it shows exactly how much the team writing improved the overall story. It makes for a great addition to what is already a good collection.",
            "Summary: too bad about the never-say-die multiverse addiction at DC. Dibny's story? Awesome. Week 43 Day 1? Like a five-year-old wrote it.Black Adam's finale was not written by that five-year-old, and works much better.And the build-up to the final climax? Cool. I felt like I participated in something actually pretty wondrous.Too bad about bringing back the multiverse tho. Seems like DC is just addicted to its easy outs - the many, many variations on the same themes that make it so easy to explain away any discontinuities. Is DC just fundamentally lazy? Some describe it as enabling creativity, but sometimes endless possibilities leave you without having to think hard, make choices or come up with elegant solutions.DC is the brute force method of writing superhero stories. Just keep bashing on the same characters until one of the iterations finally comes out with something good.I still liked the ending to 52, but it sure reminds me of how tiring these restarts get every time DC lets its writers paint them into a corner.",
            "Satisfying conclusion to the series. I felt greatly educated, by the end of it, of all the (relatively) minor DC Universe characters that I hadn't yet encountered, given that my exposure to the mainstream titles had been through Wonder Woman and Gotham-based books (oddly, I never read a lot of Batman titles. I did read a lot of Catwoman and Gotham PD books.)Story-wise, the reveal with Sobek was a moment of Holy shit, I can't believe they did that in a mainstream title! Ditto for the bit with Isis. I loved what the creators did with Renee Montoya, and her relationship with Vic Sage really resonated with me. I would love to read of her on-going adventures, as well as those of Ralph Dibny.This volume also confirmed for me what I'd long suspected, especially with the creator comments on the (creepy) Skeets reveal: comicbook plotting is far, far more amorphous than most would admit. I personally like that: it allows for a flexibility as well as a freshness to the genre when done right (of course, when done wrong, it only elicits head-scratching at best and fury at worst.)Knowing that the characters then undergo some weird personality transplants in the subsequent 52 reboot makes me sad. But this series, at least, was well worth the effort.",
            "This was an awesome serie but the landing doesn't totally stick for me. The art is much poorer in those last issues too.",
            "In this book, every page I turned was more amazing than the last.",
            "You know the feeling when you finish a TV series, or movie saga you really love? That empty feeling of utter despair that this beautiful thing you love so much has come to an end, fused with the complete satisfaction that it was everything you ever wanted it to be. As i finished the last few pages of this book it hit me like a ton of bricks, my 52 journey has ended. This is to me, the perfect example of what a comic series should be. It had mystery, action, suspense and a whole load of ambition to boot.As soon as we start in this volume we see story-lines coming to a close. Since each of these stories are so god damn good I'm going to briefly go through my opinions of each, whether you like it or not!Kicking off the book we have the conclusion of the Luthor/Steel story. At the end of the last volume Lex Luthor had just obtained meta-human powers. Taking Natasha hostage he calls out Steel to bring it on, and he certainly does bring it. Calling in the remaining Titans to his aid he heads to Lexcorp, once again repping his classic Steel armor. John shows how much of a complete bad-ass he is here and lets loose on all of Luthor's cronies with no restraint. Though it was a satisfying conclusion, it would have been more satisfying if we got to see John give Lex the smack down. Especially since its been brewing since the first book. After Charlie passed away in the last volume, Renee is still lost and looking for the big answers. We see some interaction with Wonder Woman, Bruce Wayne and Tim Drake in these sections as well which was cool to see, seeming how they haven't really appeared in this series at all. With Renee being forced to go home she is pulled back into action when she finds that Kate Kane has been kidnapped by Intergang. She has an epiphany FINALLY, and takes on her role as the new Question. This series has made me fall head over heels for little Miss Montoya, so much so that I have ordered the first volume of Gotham Central to see how her story starts.What can i say about the Ralph Dibney story that can do it justice? After going on a massive soul searching magic ride with Dr Fate we get to what would appear to be the climax. Only then it takes a massive u-turn and mind f*&amp,ked the shit outta me! I mean wow, just wow. When you assemble such amazing writers as you have here, its no wonder they can write such a superb twist. I was so glad to see Ralph get his ultimate savage on in this segment. Showing he is far more than the stretchy man people think he is. Speaking of stretchy we also get to see Ralph back in all his elongated glory here, which is a moment I've been waiting on this moment the entire series, even though it was brief it was so worth it.We finally get some stories intertwining in this, as you would expect with it coming to an end. Its revealed that the Science Squad have been working on weapons to take out the Black Marvel family. Friends turn out to be enemies and heroes fall back into their evil ways. I really don't want to say too much cause I don't want to ruin anything for any of you, but trust me when I say that Black Adam is one of the most brutal characters in the entire DCU. I had no real opinions of Adam when i began on this journey, now he is one of my most loved characters. There is a massive battle with pretty much all of the heroes against Black Adam, including some other new faves of mine The Justice Society. How have i never paid them any attention before? Their character roster is bloody awesome, so next week I'm going to delve into the series Geoff Johns wrote.The Adam Strange/Starfire/Animal Man story came to a close, well sort of. I would expect that we havent seen the last of Lady Stix seeming how it ended, maybe it will come into play in the Countdown to Final Crisis? Last but certainly not least was the Booster Gold story. Now this has Grant Morrison oozing out of it, filled with crazy and leaking his genius. This story has been brewing slowly since week one and it takes form in something legendary here. Once again the story took a massive side step and caught me right off guard. I figured the 52 referred to the multiverse, but i didn't know how it would get there. All i can say is well done to the creative team for making this one of the most epic conclusions to a series I've ever read. I had to re-read the last issue to take in all the information, cause its pretty Morrison-heavy in its ambition, but thankfully it lands well. We get to see the formation of different earths in the multiverse. Some of my favorite being earth-3, the resurrection of the Crime Syndicate. And earth-22, which is the universe where the events of the mammoth Kingdom Come take place. I've always thought the idea of the multiverse was pure genius, it left so many door open for some fantastic opportunities. Booster Gold thrived in this story and much like Black Adam, he has become one of my favorite heroes.All and all this series was one of the most enjoyable reads I've ever layed eyes on. Proving why the DCU is THE BEST comic universe EVER! Being that I jumped into comics with the New 52 I never really understood why people got so butt-hurt when they changed so much of the history of the characters. Although N52 is still cool to me, I now share the pain of all the non-believers. After bearing witness to some of the rich characters and world changing stories that have taken shape over the last 70 or so years, it seems like such a shame to mostly wipe the slate clean. If you want a great example of an exceptional comic, then this is your go too read. "

        "desc": "In this book is concluded the adventure which began in the 17th book in the Gorean series, Savages of Gor. Half-Ear, or Zarendargar, a Kur general fallen from favor in the Steel Worlds, now sought by a death squad of his savage compeers, has determined to lure his pursuers into the Barrens, the vast prairies to the east of known Gor, populated by warring tribes known to Goreans as the Red Savages. He has arranged matters in such a way that he will be abetted in his stand against the death squad, and its human allies, by a human ally of his own, his former foe, Tarl Cabot. The ancestors of the Red Savages, as those of many other Goreans, were brought to Gor long ago in Voyages of Acquisition by the Priest-Kings. The Red Savages were settled in an area not unlike that of their former home, a sweeping, almost endless grassland, where they tend to continue their former ways of life, and war. The various tribes have in common a tradition, or myth, called the Memory. And in virtue of this tradition, myth or memory, they entertain an inveterate hostility to lighter-skinned races. Cabot makes his way into this land, and amongst these tribes, in his quest for Zarendargar, he encounters enemies and perils, conflicts and hatreds, and, ultimately, friends. And meets once more the dreadful Zarendargar. Coinciding with the 40th anniversary of the first book of the Gorean Saga, TARNSMAN OF GOR, E-Reads is proud to release the very first complete publication of all Gor books by John Norman, in both print and ebook editions, including the long-awaited 26th novel in the saga, WITNESS OF GOR. Many of the original Gor books have been out of print for years, but their popularity has endured. Each book ofthis release has been specially edited by the author and is a definitive text.",

            "BLOOD BROTHERS OF GOR, preceded by SAVAGES, actually form a single work comprising Tarl Cabot's last major adventure. These two books are among author John Norman's better mid-stage Counter-Earth novels (books 11-21), the others are BEASTS and PLAYERS. BLOOD BROTHERS is almost as good as the powerhouses of the Gorean saga: PRIEST-KINGS, NOMADS, ASSASSIN, HUNTERS, MARAUDERS, TRIBESMEN. If one only wanted to read the best of the Gor novels I'd recommend all of the above. Norman demonstrates his mastery of plotting, character creation and world-building throughout the ten volumes, everything this writer does well can be found here. If one wanted to read the top twelve, I'd add RENEGADES and MAGICIANS to the list. These are all Tarl Cabot POV adventures by the way.Combined with SAVAGES OF GOR, this is an 800-page tale, almost 300,000 words originally (with over 20,000 more added years later in newer editions), the last time Norman transports a culture from Earth to Gor until Cabot encounters the Pani a quarter of a century later. This epic adventure in an arid land among warring native American tribes even has familiar names from the past cropping up, like Kamchak and Ivar Forkbeard. Norman obviously researched American Indians extensively to bring authenticity to the story. SAVAGES and BLOOD BROTHERS aren't his only works on the subject, one of his non-Gor books GHOST DANCE deals with the culture as well. It also deals with a captive woman. In a John Norman book, that's no coincidence.",
            "One of the most misspelled worded books I have ever read. If you took out all of the repetitive conversations and repetitive slave information from all the previous books, the actual story would be 1/3 a shorter read. I enjoyed the main story-line regarding Tarl Cabot but tired of the same repetition of his books. Oh wait, looks like I'm being repetitious in this review regarding the repetition of this Gor book series. "

            "Unfortunately, things haven't changed much since 1845 except maybe back then it was easier to get drugs like Morphine, hookers were cheap, Catholics disliked Irish and other protestants perhaps a little more than these days. It was also more normal to drink a lot during the day, the political leaders got away with all kinds of bad dealings and politics (wait, maybe that one hasn't changed) and little orphan kids were treated like slaves sometimes in the sex industry...I think I just heard the FBI is cracking down on that one right now. This is one of those books I could give five stars to in several categories. Her writing ability and descriptive metaphors and observations are at the five level. The overall story and plot were not quite to the five level for me although it was a satisfying and good story. The protagonist was such a naive and likable guy. I got a little tired of some of the same themes with his relationship with his brother and with the girl he so idolized. I thought some of the religious leader personalities were too much the cliches and I wanted her to draw out some of the characters a little more, especially as there are huge revelations about some of them as the book finishes up. Several endings weren't happy enough for me and although probably realistic, left a little hole in my heart. I could feel the influences of Sherlock Holmes and other writers of the time here as she mentioned in the afterword. I enjoyed actual quotes from the newspapers of the time which helped take me to that mess of a growing NYC with all its struggles. All and all, a book well worth reading."

            "New York City Police Department Application - 18451) Can you walk?2) Are you a Democrat?If you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to both of these questions: Congratulations! You are now a police officer for the city of New York.Timothy Wilde was a bartender who was doing well by the standards of 1845. He had saved some money which he planned on using for his dream of purchasing a ferry boat and asking the woman he was in love with to marry him. However, a devastating fire leaves him homeless, unemployed, penniless and disfigured.Tim\u2019s brother, Valentine, is a politically connected fire captain who gets them both jobs on the newly formed New York police department. Since Tim hates his brother for his corrupt ways as well as his other various other sins like his morphine habit, he doesn\u2019t really want the job, but with no other options, Tim signs on. After almost a full day of training which consists of mainly being told to drag criminals to jail but to ignore the prostitutes, Tim receives a \u2018copper star\u2019 which is also the slang name of the new policemen.With New York filled with anti-Irish and anti-Catholic sentiments after the influx of immigrants due to the potato famine as well as half the population thinking that a police force is un-American, Tim and his fellow officers have their work cut out for them. After Tim comes across a female child prostitute (Or a kinchen-maab in the lingo of the day.) covered in blood, it leads to the discovery of 19 dead children who seem to have been murdered with cross-like wounds ripped into them. Tim and the fledgling police force will have to quickly solve the crime before the bloody deaths are used as propaganda that could tear New York apart.I liked the early parts of this book with its depiction of the early days of the New York police department, but once it turned into a murder mystery, it lost a lot of its charm. Part of this is due to the protagonist. Timothy is kind of a self-righteous prude in a lot of ways, and frankly I kept finding myself wishing that his wicked brother Valentine was the main character. Val may be a morphine junkie and a willing part of the corrupt Democratic political machine, but he was entertaining. The whole book suffers a bit by being a historical fiction but having a hero who is too modern despite his seemingly straight arrow outlook of the time. It may make for a more likeable character, but I just can\u2019t picture a white bartender in New York circa 1845 being so open-minded as to defend a black man against a mob as well as find himself admiring a homosexual. It\u2019s pretty to think it could have been like that, but it just seems too politically correct to be believable. However, the book deserves a lot of credit for some of the major twists it delivers in the resolution of the murder plot as well as developing the female character of Mercy Underhill. I thought I had a good idea of where all of this was going, but there were a lot of surprises, and the outcome of that did improve my opinion of Tim a lot.",
            "Hope, I've discovered, is a sad nuisance. Hope is a horse with a broken leg. ~The Gods of Gotham, Lyndsay Faye New York City, 1845. Helped by an explosion of combustible saltpeter, a great fire has once again decimated Lower Manhattan, claiming the lives of four fireman and 26 civilians. Across the Atlantic, a terrible potato blight is beginning to take its toll, and shiploads of desperate, starving Irish pour into the city despised for their race and religion. Despite having traveled so far, work and food continue to be scarce commodities. Gang violence is commonplace as Dead Rabbits clash with the infamous Bowery Boys. The city forms its first police department. The men are greeted with a mixture of fear, hostility and suspicion. Pinned to the men's chests is a roughly cut copper star.Welcome to Gotham, where the streets of Five Points are plagued with filth, prostitution, spilled blood and political corruption. Children are left to fend for themselves hunted by disease, hunger and predators who will draft them into a life of thievery or sexual exploitation. The Gods of Gotham is historical fiction at its best -- filled to the brim with vivid characters, authentic dialogue, and a sense of place so strong you can taste it in the back of your throat. As an audiobook, it is a marvel, drawing you in, caressing your ear, transporting you back in time. In one fell swoop, Timothy Wilde is left unemployed, disfigured and penniless. In an attempt to save his brother from utter desperation, Valentine gets Tim a job on the newly drafted New York City police force. One fateful evening walking home to his modest lodgings atop a bakery, Tim crashes into a young girl clad in a blood-soaked nightdress. She is frantic, almost delirious, and murmurs They will tear him apart. And so Tim is pulled into a tangled and depraved web of conspiracy and unholy murder. It will change him irrevocably, as the streets of New York hold their own council and wait to see what the remaining 19th century has in store.I loved this story, everything about it. Timothy Wilde is a great character as is his vice-ridden, brawling brother Valentine and the prickly relationship they share, weakened by years of mistrust and animosity. Little Bird Daly, just ten years old, is memorably precocious and heart-breakingly real, a symbol of the abominable acts perpetrated on orphaned children in the years before the law started to identify and protect them in earnest. And New York City -- how grand and tawdry and exciting and perilous you really are. You've been romanticized as often as you've been vilified. You are notorious, legendary, epic, and any story set in your streets must be all of these things too or become lost in your long shadow. The Gods of Gotham is that story. You two are well-met and well-matched. I cannot wait to return. ***For anyone interested, BBC America has created the series Copper set in 1860's New York featuring a young Irish cop tasked with policing in the Five Points. I haven't seen an episode yet, but you can bet I'm going to give it a try. ",
            "This one was...rough. Like, AMAZING. But also rough. This one deals with a LOT of difficult topics. There's a hell of a lot of anti-Irish sentiment, because it's set in New York in the 1840s, right at the time when there was a huge influx of Irish immigrants due to the Famine. (ETA: Reading it this week with the Cheeto-in-Chief's bullshit Muslim ban was actually kind of a horrifying reminder that there's ALWAYS been an immigrant population that's discriminated against and that the existing population thinks are backwards scum who are out to ruin our way of life)There's also a hell of a lot of anti-Catholic sentiment that goes hand in hand with the anti-Irish sentiment: they're all stupid, they worship the Pope rather than God, they're in league with the devil, etcetera. Add in the Irish population being racist towards the free black population, a handful of children who'd been forced into prostitution, and a crapton of dead kids and you've got yourself one hell of a difficult read. HOWEVER. At no point in the story does the main character join in with the discrimination. He doesn't judge anyone who's been involved in sex work. I guess you could argue that he judges Mercy when he finds out?? But to me, it was more surprise than judgement, because he'd always thought of her as the woman he was going to marry. But even then, he doesn't turn his back on her and he saves her life and then helps her start over. So. He just goes out every day and does his job, even though it's not a job that he particularly wants. I loved the characters, and the writing was compelling. But it's definitely not an easy book to read, especially when you reach the author's note and find out that the case of infanticide that kicks off the whole story is based on actual events. Oof.",
            "(Reprinted from the Chicago Center for Literature and Photography cclapcenter.com. I am the original author of this essay, as well as the owner of CCLaP, it is not being reprinted illegally.)A couple of years ago, Lyndsay Faye's clever Sherlock Holmes/Jack The Ripper thriller Dust and Shadow made CCLaP's best-of-the-year lists, and with me specifically saying at the time that I was looking forward to a wholly original creation from this engaging, smart author, and now that original creation is here, and I have to confess that it's a stunner. Entitled The Gods of Gotham, it's the first in what I assume will eventually be a whole series of adventures about one Timothy Wilde, who in the 1840s becomes one of the first-ever police officers of New York City, making this essentially a clever retconned detective story form a time when the very profession was being invented for the first time. And indeed, much like her previous book, Faye has the ability to take the real details of this period and still make it feel like a fantastical steampunk novel, and that's because, much like Martin Scorsese did with Gangs of New York (set in the same area of Manhattan and during the same general period as Faye's own story), The Gods of Gotham wallows in the most otherworldly elements of actual 19th-century New York that even existed, presenting us with a magical world of newsie underground theatre companies, hidden caches of forgotten catacombs, crumbling Gothic jail facilities, wharf-side bordellos, morphine fever dreams and a lot, lot more. A book that's received more mainstream attention than just about any other genre novel I've reviewed in the last few years, it seems almost inevitable that this will eventually be made into a big-budget Hollywood film, and undoubtedly with a whole series of further adventures still to come, so do yourself a favor and get in on the ground floor of this remarkable Victorian universe as soon as possible.Out of 10: 9.3 "

            "Selling Women is a highly readable book about prostitution in 17th- through 19th-century Japan. It travels through five times and places, discussing the social implications of prostitution and showing how communities both altered and were altered by prostitution. Four of the five chapters give a rare look at prostitution outside the Yoshiwara, including:* An early mining town where men were allowed--even forced--to treat their wives as capital, denying women rights they would have in later years because of the economic importance of the mine.* The countryside way stations where waitresses served more than tea, and officials struggled with a conundrum: Local men ruined their families financially at the teahouses, but the presence of the waitresses encouraged economic development.* The licensed quarter of Maruyama in Nagasaki, where courtesans were allowed to leave the quarter to visit the Dutch and Chinese traders' quarters. Unique among pleasure quarters, the women of Maruyama were locals, and some of them still lived at home with their parents.The book is well written and doesn't assume prior knowledge on the part of the reader--a common problem with books in this niche.If you're looking for a quick education in Japanese courtesan culture, start with Yoshiwara to understand the pleasure-quarter ideal, then Selling Women to see how the ideal played out in less elevated surroundings.",
            "Fantastic antidote to histories that are predominantly focused on elites, or ones that ignore the specific experience of differentiated groups within early modern Japan (especially ones that ignore women). If you read histories from the 90s onwards on early modern Japan, you may get the feeling that Japanese history was dominated by an old boys network there for a while, so it's a breath of fresh air to get this detailed, nuanced perspective on how bodies, gender, mores, and markets had to be managed through all the social and economic changes of the period. This is, in many ways, a perfect history, in that it marries an objective perspective of trends moving through EMJ (read through legal documents and shogunate proclamations) to the lived experiences (via diaries and letters) of people trying to manage their way through the contradictions and traps laid for them. Meanwhile, it's also one of those rare academic texts that's actually INTERESTING and readable. One of the best books on Japan out there."

            "Written by the co-owner of Sophie\u2019s Yarns in Philadelphia and an English Ph.D. from the University of Pennsylvania, this book was close to my heart. Out of my very meager reading of knitting books, this is by far the one I have enjoyed the most. This book provides a brief summary of knitting history and technique, and includes several simple patterns along the way. What I found most valuable were Myers\u2019 explanations on different guidelines of working with color (e.g. hue, intensity and saturation). Unlike some other knitting books, she doesn\u2019t spend a lot of time on one technique or one item of clothing, but gives the reader different characteristics and tendencies of fabrics and encourages the reader to experiment. The style is detailed and factual, but is backed up by a theoretical framework. It\u2019s easy to understand but will give you the tools and concepts to do more yourself. (In those of you who enjoy Myers Briggs personality, this book was written by an N in S language.) It\u2019s not the best book to pick up if you want to learn knitting by yourself, because it lacks diagrams, but it\u2019s a pleasant, informative read for someone who has started learning but wants to delve deeper into the craft.",

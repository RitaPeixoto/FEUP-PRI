                    "Reznikoff's HolocaustIn its spareness, eloquence, and simplicity, Charles Reznikoff's poem Holocaust remains one of the best literary attempts to come to grips with this bleak tragedy. Reznikoff (1894 -- 1976) wrote the poem in 1975, and it was published by John Martin and Black Sparrow Press. It is good to have it back in print.Reznikoff was little known during his life. He wrote objectivist poetry which took as its motto no ideas but in things. Poetry for Reznikoff directs the reader to things -- to reality and experiences -- rather than to ego or to the feelings of the author.Holocaust was Reznikoff's final work. It is based entirely on the records of the Nuremberg trials and of the Eichmann trial. There is no narrative voice or I in the poem. Further, there are no names given, with the exception of the salutation Heil Hitler by members of the S.S.The poem is told in a roughly chronological way in 12 sections beginning with the early deportations of Jews and ending with the pending liberation of the camps. The cruelty and destructiveness of the Holocaust are shown in spare, understated short poems. Here is the concluding poem of Section IV, Ghettos.One of the S.S. men caught a woman with a baby in her arms.She began asking for mercy: if she were shotthe baby should live.She was near a fence between the ghetto and where Poles livedand behind the fence were Poles ready to catch the babyand she was about to hand it over when caught.The S.S. man took the baby from her armsand shot her twice,and then held the baby in his hands.The mother bleeding but still alive, crawled up to his feet.The S.S. man laughedand tore the baby apart as one would tear a rag.Just then a stray dog passedand the S.S. man stooped to pat itand took a lump of sugar out of his pocketand gave it to the dog.Here is a section from part V of the Poem, MassacresThey gathered some twenty Hasidic Jews from their homes,in the robes these wear,wearing their prayer shawls, too,and holding prayer books in their hands.They were led up a hill.Here they were told to chant their prayersand raise their hands for help to Godand, as they did so,the officers poured kerosene under themand set it on fire.Reznikoff works hard so that his ego and judgment do not intrude upon the events he describes. The writing is simple, understated, and direct. The reader feels he is witnessing the events described without an overlay. To the extent possible, the reader is allowed to respond to the events directly, without the intermediary of the author, and with no suprefluities or ideological commitments beyond the events themselves.There are bleak scenes of horrors and killings in Holocaust, both of individual people and of masses, in gas chambers, gas trucks, firing squads, burnings, and elsewhere. There are also a small number of episodes of acts of kindness. Reznikoff presents his materials throughout lucidly, simply, and with understatement. Here is one final passage from the book, from section VI, Gas Chambers and Gas Trucks:The bodies were thrown out quicklyfor other transports were coming:bodies blue, wet with sweat and urine, legs covered with excrement,and everywhere the bodies of babies and children.Two dozen workers were busyopening the mouths of the dead with iron hooksand with chisels taking out teeth with golden caps,and elsewhere other workers were tearing open the deadlooking for money or jewels that might have been swallowed.And all the bodies were then thrown into the large pits dug near the gas chambersto be covered with sand.Reznikoff is an American poet who deserves to be read and remembered. This poem of his old age will help the reader to reflect upon the Holocaust.Robin Friedman",
                    "Does a poet write a poem, or does a poet make a poem? I prefer the latter verb. And never has that verb been more true than for Charles Reznikoff's Holocaust. For this poem, Reznikoff doesn't write a word. The poem is built on two sources, the Nurenberg war trials and transcripts of the Adolf Eichmann trial. Reznikoff never intrudes upon these texts: he slices, edits and lineates. He does not comment on the horrors the words recount. And horrors there are a'plenty.Reznikoff does not write, he winnows existing texts down to their barest essence. He takes history and allows reportage to reveal truth. And what emerges is a poem. A poem with sections entitled Deportation or Massacres or Gas Chambers and Gas Trucks is a poem that can reveal the bottomless evil of mankind.  Because he doesn't write a word for this poem, Reznikoff seems to be saying that there's not a word to be said. Nothing can capture the horror, the real visceral horror of Nazi crimes more than the words of those who saw it themselves. No poem. No novel. No song. Let's allow all this to unspool, says the Reznikoff in my mind. And I imagine a coil of wire springing against its winding. Let's tighten all this down into history, say those who would placate us, but Reznikoff shows how the a coil of stiff wire will not yield to the turning of the spool. Reznikoff has made a poem here. Holocaust is the last poem of his life, but is the first poem of his that I've read. What an introduction. By choosing to hide himself, to hide the poet behind the words, Reznikoff suggests that the horrors of the Holocaust cannot be encapsulated, locked down, trapped in a poem or novel. Reznikoff suggests that to actually sit down and try to create (from one's own imaginings) a piece of indelible literature about one of mankind's blackest periods is folly. There are no words to be made. There is, however, this poem.",
                    "Wow…I’m very glad (and horrified) that I read this. This collection of prose poems are taken directly from source material from the Nuremberg Trials and the Eichmann trial in Jerusalem. They are stunning in their barbarity. They are stunning in their inhumanity. It was an important reminder to me of what it looks like to be human - in all of its glory and in all of its depravity. It’s a stunning, stunning read. I’m very glad I read it - and I hope it changes me. ",

The Dorfs are \"good\" Germans, loyal to the new Nazi regime, and their son Erik, a promising lawyer, finds his ambitions realized in the SS at the side of the ruthless Reynard Heydrich. The Weiss family is Jewish, also seemingly \"good\" Germans, but doomed under the new regime and its determination to exterminate the Jewish population."

                    "So many books have been written about the holocaust. What makes this one different is that Gerald Green tells the story from both sides: one is the story of a young Jew, Rudy Weiss, harrowing escape from Germany and his family's unsuccessful attempts to survive the Nazi regime and the diary of Erik Dorf, a drifting young German, who becomes a powerful Nazi administrator at the urging of his wife, slowly indoctrinated into the regime. The two men are connected by Rudy's father, who was a caring doctor, who treated Dorf's wife and by the Weiss family's piano. Amazing that this book has not received more notoriety.",
                    "(3,5)“Olocausto” è il romanzo tratto dalla sceneggiatura dell’omonima serie televisiva trasmessa per la prima volta negli Stati Uniti nel 1978 e in Europa nell’anno seguente. Gerald Green ha dato forma letteraria alla propria sceneggiatura raccontando la storia dal punto di vista dei due personaggi principali, l’ebreo berlinese Rudi Weiss e il giovane avvocato Erik Dorf.Nel 1952, dal kibbutz in Israele dove si è trasferito dopo il termine della guerra, Rudi rievoca la lenta dissoluzione della sua famiglia (i genitori Berta e Josef, i fratelli Karl e Anna) sullo sfondo degli eventi che oscurarono gli anni dal 1935 al 1945. Alle vicende famigliari e alla personale odissea attraverso l’Europa orientale, si alternano le pagine dei diari di Erik Dorf, divenuto – dopo l’adesione al partito nazista – ufficiale delle SS al servizio di Reinhard Heydrich.Priva di uno stile ricercato, la scrittura è molto chiara e scorrevole. Le descrizioni sono limitate, a volte assenti, mentre il testo è concentrato su dialoghi e riflessioni interiori, l’interesse e l’attenzione sono tenuti vivi e costanti dall’incalzante svolgimento della trama. Tra libro e film (Meryl Streep e James Woods tra gli attori protagonisti) si riscontrano lievi differenze in qualche dettaglio riguardante i personaggi, variazioni comunque irrilevanti nella sostanza (nel romanzo l’autore dispone di spazio maggiore e non è vincolato a tempi ed esigenze del linguaggio cinematografico). Merito di quest’opera è l’aver richiamato l’attenzione – verso la fine degli anni Settanta – su un argomento sempre meno dibattuto, su eventi sconosciuti a gran parte dell’opinione pubblica o quasi dimenticati, grazie alla volontà di ignorare e dimenticare diffusa in Occidente già durante la guerra (gli Alleati erano a conoscenza dell’esistenza dei campi di sterminio ma evitarono di informare la gente comune) e proseguita dopo la sua fine (quando il nemico era diventato l’Unione Sovietica, e la Germania doveva diventare un solido alleato di frontiera).Géraldine Schwarz, giornalista e scrittrice franco-tedesca, nel suo bel libro “I senza memoria” (“Les Amnésiques”, edizione italiana Einaudi, 2019) ricorda:… “Per quanto sorprendente possa sembrare, l’evento che fece saltare i chiavistelli della rimozione in Europa e negli Stati Uniti fu una serie televisiva americana, Olocausto, di Marvin J. Chomsky e Gerald Green … Il racconto di quei drammi individuali rese all’improvviso immaginabile per il vasto pubblico l’inimmaginabile e scatenò un terremoto internazionale nella coscienza collettiva.” …La lettura di “Olocausto” aiuta a comprendere le ragioni e le motivazioni che portarono milioni di persone a farsi massacrare senza quasi opporre resistenza, e come in tutta Europa milioni di persone “molto educate e perbene” arrivarono con naturalezza a trasformarsi in assassini, ladri e criminali.(3 ½)",
                    "Non ho stelline abbastanza da poter dare a questo libro, 5 sono sicuramente troppo poche.Il titolo del libro fa subito capire in quale periodo ci troviamo, siamo all’inizio del secondo conflitto mondiale. A capitoli alterni ci viene raccontata la storia della famiglia Weiss, ebrei e quella del giovane tedesco Erik Dorf. Le varie vicissitudini che la famiglia Weiss sarà costretta a subire sono devastanti, mi sono ritrovata molte volte con gli occhi bagnati e il groppo in gola, perché non è possibile restare indifferenti a tante atrocità. Non da meno sono stati i racconti del giovane avvocato Erik Dorf. La sua ascesa, voluta ed istigata da sua moglie, permetteranno al lettore di conoscere le fredde strategie, la mentalità spietata e il folle piano dei nazisti, perpetrato per anni, per annientare un popolo intero. Difficile capire che quanto è successo sia potuto avvenire senza che nessuno sia intervenuto in difesa del popolo ebraico.Credo che nessun libro sia mai riuscito ad emozionarmi e a straziarmi come questo. Entra di diritto tra i libri più belli e toccanti che io abbia mai detto, per cui non posso che consigliarvi di cercare di recuperare questo libro, anche se dato.

                    "Weeks after Adolf Hitler came to power in 1933, the Nazi regime established the first concentration camps in Germany. Initially used for real and suspected political enemies, the camps increasingly came under SS control and became sites for the repression of social outsiders and German Jews. Terror was central to the Nazi regime from the beginning, and the camps gradually moved toward the center of repression, torture, and mass murder during World War II and the Holocaust.,This collection brings together revealing primary documents on the crucial origins of the Nazi concentration camp system in the prewar years between 1933 and 1939, which have been overlooked thus far. Many of the documents are unpublished and have been translated into English for the first time. These documents provide insight into the camps from multiple perspectives, including those of prisoners, Nazi officials, and foreign observers, and shed light on the complex relationship between terror, state, and society in the Third Reich."

                    "As the first extermination camp established by the Nazi regime and the prototype of the single-purpose death camps of Treblinka, Sobibor, and Belzec, the Chelmno death camp stands as a crucial but largely unexplored element of the Holocaust. This book is the first comprehensive work in any language to detail all aspects of the camp's history, organization, and operations and to remedy the dearth of information in Holocaust literature about Chelmno, which served as a template for the Nazis' \"Final Solution.\" Patrick Montague reveals events leading to the establishment of the camp, how the mobile killing squad employed the world's first gas van to terminate the lives of mentally-ill patients, and the assembly-line procedure employed in the camp to commit genocide on the Jewish population. Based on over 20 years of careful research, this book provides the first single-volume history of the camp and its handful of survivors and includes previously unpublished first-hand accounts and photographs. ,Chelmno and the Holocaust, is a vital contribution to a critically important chapter in the history of the Holocaust."

                    "Everyone knows about Auschwitz, no one's heard of Chelmno, which was in many ways a much more horrible place. It's true that more than a million people died at Auschwitz and only 150,000 people died at Chelmno (or possibly as many as twice that number, estimates vary widely). But tens of thousands of people SURVIVED Auschwitz. The number of Chelmno survivors? Six.This is one of only two English language book-length studies of the camp that I know of, so it would be valuable no matter what. But it's also an excellent work of history, including many facts I have never seen anywhere else. Montague got to know Szymon Srebrnik, Chelmno's last known survivor (he died in 2006), and interviewed him several times for the book. I kind of wish he'd talked bout Srebrnik's postwar life -- namely, how he managed to find a way to live after going through that kind of horror -- but I realize that was beyond the scope of this book.The reader should know that it isn't until well into the book that Montague starts talking about Jews. That's because Chelmno (the Nazis' first attempt at an extermination camp) was originally created to serve the T4 program, the Third Reich's program to eliminate disabled and mentally ill people. It wasn't until after the war started that they got the idea to start using it for Jews also.As Montague points out, the T4 program was an important factor in both the history of Chelmno and the Holocaust in general, because it got the SS men accustomed to the idea of gassing vast numbers of people. So of course he talks about it in detail. I suppose if you really wanted you could skip the T4 section and head straight on to 1939, but you really shouldn't.Anyway, this was an absorbing book and it's got info you won't find anywhere else. Highly recommend for researchers."

                    "A significant new look at the legacy of the Nazi regime, this book exposes the workings of past beliefs and political interests in how - and how differently - the two Germanys have recalled the crimes of Nazism, from the anti-Nazi emigration of the 1930s through the establishment of a day of remembrance for the victims of National Socialism in 1996. Why, Jeffrey Herf asks, would German politicians raise the specter of crimes at all, in view of the considerable depth and breadth of support the Nazis held during their reign? Why did the public memory of Nazi anti-Jewish persecution and the Holocaust emerge, if selectively, in West Germany, yet was repressed and marginalized in \"anti-fascist\" East Germany? And how do the politics of left and right come into play in this divided memory? The answers reveal the surprising relationship between how the crimes of Nazism were publicly recalled and how East and West Germany separately evolved a Communist dictatorship and a liberal democracy. This book, for the first time, points to the impact of the Cold War confrontation in both West and East Germany on the public memory of anti-Jewish persecution and the Holocaust."

                    "This interesting book sets out to ask the ways in which anti-Nazi leaders formulated their conceptions of Nazism during the Second World War, and the ways in which this shaped the subsequent development of memory in the two Germanys. 7 Interesting Arguments:1. Focus is on politics and political leaders: “The history of politics and the history of beliefs, ideas, ideology, discourses, narratives and representations are inseparable from one another. By writing about politicians and the discourses and memory they construct, I hope to illustrate the importance of politics for shaping the way a society thinks about its past while at the same time drawing attention to the autonomous weight that traditions and interpretative frameworks exert on political life.” (9)2. Post-1945 Germany saw the resurrection of indigenous traditions rather than the imposition of new foreign ones: “Postwar memories rested on interpretations of Nazism which its German opponents had begun to develop in the Weimar Republic. (5) This concept is refereed to as: multiple restorations. The term refers to continuities that link German political traditions of the Weimar era and the anti-Nazi emigration to the period after 1945.” (3)3. In the West, the government sought at first to move on from the crimes of Nazism in order to strengthen democracy, but this came at a price: “The price for postwar integration of those Germans compromised by their beliefs and actions in the Third Reich was silence about the crimes of that period. Memory and justice might produce a right-wing revolt that would undermine a still fragile democracy. So democracy had to be built upon a shaky foundation of justice delayed- hence denied- and weakened memory.” (7)4. Importance of the role of wartime exile is heavily discussed: “Exile placed the German political emigres in proximity to the Jewish and non-German victims of National Socialism, be they the peoples of Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union or Jewish refugees in New York or Mexico City... The experience of exile made their postwar memory less provincial, self-centred and self-pitying, and made them more aware of what the Germans under the Nazi regime had inflicted on others.” (375)5. The SPD are a driving force in calling for recognition of the crimes of Nazism: “Before 1933 the Social Democratic Party was the fiercest defender of German democracy and of the Jewish minority in Germany... In the 1950s, German Social Democrats were the strongest supporters of a sharper judicial confrontation with the Nazi past, restitution to Jewish survivors, and close relations with Israel. Adenauer’s prominence has diverted our gaze from the central role played by Social Democrats in putting the memory of the Holocaust on the national agenda of West German politics and policy.” (377)6. “The historical significance of the 1960s was that the relationship between memory and democracy began to change. This was part of the significance of the election of Willy Brandt in 1969 and the Social-Liberal era that extended until 1982 under Helmut Schmidt. For the first time a nationally elected majority emerged that was in favour of more public memory and more justice for the Nazi past.” (390)7. As for the GDR: “The anticosmopolitan purge of winter 1953, the arrest and imprisonment of Paul Merker, the purging of those Jews and their sympathizers who supported restitution or opposed East Germany’s active antagonism toward Israel, the flight of Leo Zuckermann and of the leadership of the tiny Jewish community all irrevocably broke those bonds of solidarity which had emerged between some Communists and some Jews during the war.” (385)",
                    "Important book about how East Germany sought to depict the Holocaust without fully acknowledging the Jewish dimension. (The East German propagandists claimed that Nazi persecution was based on class, not race. This sometimes facilitated their own anti-Semitic measures.) Herf's research is impressive. "

He is able to convince his family of the danger they are in and decide to go to Brest Litovsk where the rest of their people are living in a semi nomadic existence. When they arrive at the Gypsy camp the majority of them refuse to believe that the Nazis will persecute them as they are Aryans. It's not until some Gypsies are killed that they realise that they do need to flee. It's decided that they will go to Hungary as it's still a free country.

                    "Romani holocaust is one of the less known atrocities of World War II. This is the first book I came across that provides a lot history on how genocide acts were commited against these people. While the Jewish survivors had given enough accounts of their stories, Romani survivors' tales were rarely told probably because they had a lower literacy levels compared with the Jewish survivors. Roman Migra's story (produced by Alexander Ramati using Migra's diary writing) is very touching and sad, especially because the occurrences are true. After being sent to Auschwitz, Roman becomes a translator for Dr. Josef Mengele while his father plays the violin to calm the Jews as they enter the gas chambers. Despite the subject being what it is, this was an easy read, well-written, and is not as depressing as one might think. I was listening to the audio book, I only paused at listening when I read about Dr. Mengele's treatment/experimentation on twins. I couldn't listen to the audio about them. Other than that, this was a great book to read. *Recommend it.",
                    "This is reminiscent of Night by Elie Wiesel, and while it speaks to and honors the horrors faced by the Jewish population, this book importantly highlights the simultaneous suffering of the Gypsy population. Especially when discussing the Holocaust, or any event fueled by hatred of the other, underscoring the multi-faceted nature is imperative. This book, while brief, vividly uplifted the beliefs, traditions, and resiliency of Gypsies, particularly within the context of massive pain and danger. It also reminds us, as I said, that rarely ever is it one people targeting one people, more often, it is multiple targets, perhaps just in fewer numbers or targeted differently, but the net of hatred is wide and not naming that brings oppressive silence to those who suffer. I read Night my freshman year of high school, I would love to see these books be taught alongside each other.",

I think its the ability that the book has to keep you reading, no matter how harsh or sad the history gets, it gives you yet another view on WWII, it reminds you that it wasnt just the jews that suffered. Just gotta say it again, this is a must read.",

It is an important book, and the novel is written in a way that is easy to read, even though it is a troubling, painful story that few people know about. I won’t ever forget it. It is a horrific part of history. I really appreciated the way the author presented Roman Mirga’s story, first telling about the lives of the Romany people, ensuring that the reader understood the beauty of their culture, and how brave his people were, first escaping to Hungary, reestablishing their lives, only to be captured by the Nazis and sent to Auschwitz.

                    "Tracing the rise of racist and eugenic ideologies, Henry Friedlander, explores in chilling detail how the Nazi program of secretly exterminating the handicapped and disabled evolved into the systematic destruction of Jews and Gypsies. He describes how the so-called euthanasia of the handicapped provided a practical model for the later mass murder, thereby initiating the Holocaust.,The Nazi regime pursued the extermination of Jews, Gypsies, and the handicapped based on a belief in the biological, and thus absolute, inferiority of those groups. To document the connection between the assault on the handicapped and the Final Solution, Friedlander shows how the legal restrictions and exclusionary policies of the 1930s, including mass sterilization, led to mass murder during the war. He also makes clear that the killing centers where the handicapped were gassed and cremated served as the models for the extermination camps.,Based on extensive archival research, the book also analyzes the involvement of the German bureaucracy and judiciary, the participation of physicians and scientists, and the nature of popular opposition."

Needless to say, I went into this with great expectations, and, perhaps not-so-surprisingly, I came away very disappointed. Although the author seeks to do honor to the lesser-known victims of the Holocaust, the book itself doesn't do a good enough job of this, at least personally. I'm unsure whether this is a stylistic issue, if, indeed, this is a result of the scant amount of concrete evidence pertaining to this atrocious aspect of the wider horrors of WWII, as the author claims, or whether this is due to something else entirely.",

                    "Adolf Eichmann, the head of operations for the Nazis’ Final Solution, was a man whose very name struck fear in the heart of any hearers. But as World War II came to an end in 1945, this powerful man somehow disappeared, seemingly going unpunished for his part in the Holocaust. Incredibly, he managed to escape notice for sixteen years, hiding in Argentina, until a team of spies brought him back to Israel where he faced justice. Readers will be fascinated at Eichmann’s ability to hide in plain sight and the fact that a teen girl and her blind father provided information that would lead to his arrest. The involvement of an elite Israeli spy team, many of them with personal connections to the Holocaust, and lesser-known heroic figures, makes readers race through the book to see if Eichmann manages to escape and go underground once again. The book relates some of the mistakes and assumptions that could have spelled failure for the team and its mission as well as its triumphs and the dedication of its members. It's interesting to consider how close Eichmann came to getting away with his part in the genocide, and his certainty, even when he was tried, that he was simply following orders. With photos sprinkled throughout the book, this narrative nonfiction title deservedly won the YALSA Award for Excellence in Nonfiction. "

                    "Absolutely excellent piece of narrative non-fiction. This book was full of facts but told in a way that made it read like a spy novel thriller. I had never heard of Eichmann, which shames me since WWII and Holocaust history is the time period I know the most about and have spent the most time studying. I don't know how I missed his name in every thing I learned. This book was not as focused on the horrible atrocities of the Holocaust as much as it was about the aftermath, which is something I knew little about. I knew many Nazis escaped to Argentina, but I did not realize that the country was brimming with them. The entire time I was reading the book was surreal, I could not believe these events, sometimes just pure strokes of luck, truly happened, which is one of the many things that makes this book so cool. I had trouble keeping names straight, and a few times had to go back and reread passages to remember who was who, but it otherwise was a read I'd have no problem giving to a middle schooler. Excellent book and I hope a contender for the Excellence in Non-fiction for Young Adults Award. ",
                    "Had no plan to read this book but when your best friend ask you to read a particular book, you better do, particularly when she took the liberty to thrust the book into your hand! The backstory was we spent our Sunday morning walk discussing the Nazi hunters and the case of Adolf Eichman.This book was well-written and riveting and there were few passages that took my breath away. Imagine yourself face to face with 'the evil' whom responsible for the death of 6 million of your people in which your family members were among them and yet you had to restrained yourself from avenging their death right there and then. The team to their credits kept carried out the task admirably.There's of course, the question whether the kidnapping of Eichmann in Argentina to have the trial in Israel was a just one?I agree with the notion that neither Germany nor Argentina would bring Eichmann to trial. The world need to hear what the Final Solution for the Jewish Question was about which was the central point of Hitler's war. Eichmann maintained his innocent of all crime right to the end and reasoned that he was only following orders. But if he was sincerely believe he was innocent why he saw the need to disguised himself to be the person he was not and to run away to Argentina, a safe haven for former Nazis? Would it not better for him (and his family) to face the music right from the start?",
                    "The Nazi Hunters was a book that was promoted at BEA this year, so naturally I was very curious to read this account of the capture of Adolf Eichmann in 1960. The author, Neal Bascomb, had already written a book about the group of Holocaust survivors who pulled off Eichmann's capture for adults called Hunting Eichmann and now he has revised it for younger readers.Eichmann was the very high ranking Nazi who had been responsible first for the emigration of Jews to Palestine and later for implementing the Final Solution beginning in 1942 to meet Hitler's goal of making Europe Jew free. But in April 1945, as the Allies attacked Berlin and with the deaths of 6 million Jews on his hands, it was time for Eichmann to get out of Europe. For 16 years, no one heard anything about him. It was as if he simply disappeared off the face of the earth.Amazingly, despite efforts to find Eichmann and bring him to justice, he was never found until a teenage girl named Sylvia Hermann, living in Buenos Aires, South America in 1956, started dating a young man named Nick Eichmann. Invited to dinner at the Hermann home, Nick, like his father, was also anti-Semitic and couldn't resist commenting at table that his father had been a high ranking Nazi officer and it would have been better if Germany had finished what it started as respects the Jews in Europe. It seems amazing that the capture of such a notorious criminal began with two young people dating for a brief time, but eventually a group of survivors of Eichmann's concentration camps came together based on this and additional information. But it didn't happen immediately. In fact, interest in what the Hermann's reported to Israeli intelligence died and it wasn't until a few years later that Eichmann was again identified and a group of highly trained Mossad spies and Holocaust survivors set the plan to capture him in motion.The Nazi Hunters is a hard book to put down, but it is also a fast read, in part because it is so well researched and so excellently written. It is as exciting and tense as any spy thriller you might read with one difference - it all really happened. Lest you forget that what you are reading is nonfiction, there is also an abundance of photographs of the people, the places invloved and the documents used, some forged, to help the reader formulate a well rounded picture of the whole very clandestine operation from start to finish. And because most of the names will not be familiar to readers today, and because there were so many of them, there is also an in-depth list of all the people who participated on some level or other in the plan to capture Eichmann. Bascomb has really done such a good job of presenting the whole story factually and appropriately for young readers, without simply dumbing down his original adult work, and he includes plenty of back matter for further information and/or inquiry. I have read Hannah Arendt's account of Eichmann's trial in Israel, Eichmann in Jerusalem, a number of times, but have never read an account of how he got there. Bascomb does cover the trial briefly, but his main focus is really the capture of Eichmann. And I can say unequivocally, that from the beginning to the end, Bascomb will keep you on the edge of your seat as Eichmann's fate unfolds. The Nazi Hunters is a book I would definitely recommend to anyone interested in the Holocaust and its perpetrators.This book is recommended for readers age 12+This book was an E-ARC from NetGalleyThe review was originally posted at The Children's War",
                    "Fantastic how a book where you know how it all ends up can still be so suspenseful. I was reading this book in a snow storm and then the power went out and it was so creepy. Both an engrossing spy story and beautiful testament to these survivors' quest for justice."

                    "The story is about two girls, one is Jewish and her name is Lydia and the other girl her name is Helen. The time was 1942 and a new law was in place that all Jews must wear a star on their clothing. It was Helen’s birthday and Lydia came to spend the night. Helen’s parents worked at a bar and was not home that evening. At Eleven o’clock there was a knock on the door, it was madam Eleven O’clock but they did not answer. Then later another knock and a male voice said that he was the Midnight Ghost but again the girls did not answer the door. The parents finally arrived at home and the girls explained what had happened. The dad went to look for the two people and only found the madam hiding in a dark. Lydia then told Helens parents that she wanted to go home. Helen was mad because she left her on her birthday but Lydia gave her a present before she left. Helen has never seen her again and wrote this book in hopes that she will again see Lydia.Genre: Historical FictionSuggested Ages: 8 to 12 years old",
                    "Summary:Star of Fear, Star of Hope is a book about World War II, specifically, the Holocaust. The story begins by introducing two girls, Hellen and Lydia. These two girls were friends, and Hellen noticed that like many other people, her friend Lydia wore a star on her clothes. All she knew about it was that because of the law she had to wear the star. One night, before Helen’s nine-year birthday, she had Lydia sleep over. That night, someone started desperately knocking at the door, the woman was wearing a star, just like Lydia, and she was saying she was “Madam Eleven O’Clock”. When Helen’s parents got home, she told them what was happening, and they led “Madam Eleven O’Clock” inside. Lydia couldn’t stop starring at the woman’s star. The woman looked at Lydia and told Helen’s parents to warn her parents of what was going on. Suddenly, Lydia asked Helen’s parent to please take her home. That was the last time Helen ever saw Lydia. Theme: The pain and sadness of the Holocaust.Personal Response: Even though I was not alive during this period, I have been to the museums. And the feeling portrayed in the book, is the same one I had when I visited the museums. (sadness, pain, fear)Recommend: I would recommend this book because even though it is about a serious and painful topic, children need to know what happened and how many people were affected by World War II.

Although Helen believes it's “pretty,” she is forewarned by Lydia’s mother of the meaning of the star, “Stars at morning, better take warning. Stars at night, hope is in sight.” Told at the beginning of the story, this quote brings chills knowing the possible outcome for Lydia and her family. The morning after Helen spends what happens to be her last night with Lydia, and the last time they're together, she is confused about witnessing the folks with suitcases and stars on their clothes being led out in filed lines by the French police.

                    "Reinhard Heydrich is widely recognized as one of the great iconic villains of the twentieth century, an appalling figure even within the context of the Nazi leadership. Chief of the Nazi Criminal Police, the SS Security Service, and the Gestapo, ruthless overlord of Nazi-occupied Bohemia and Moravia, and leading planner of the \"Final Solution,\" Heydrich played a central role in Hitler's Germany. He shouldered a major share of responsibility for some of the worst Nazi atrocities, and up to his assassination in Prague in 1942, he was widely seen as one of the most dangerous men in Nazi Germany. Yet Heydrich has received remarkably modest attention in the extensive literature of the Third Reich.,Robert Gerwarth weaves together little-known stories of Heydrich's private life with his deeds as head of the Nazi Reich Security Main Office. Fully exploring Heydrich's progression from a privileged middle-class youth to a rapacious mass murderer, Gerwarth sheds new light on the complexity of Heydrich's adult character, his motivations, the incremental steps that led to unimaginable atrocities, and the consequences of his murderous efforts toward re-creating the entire ethnic makeup of Europe."

                    "Reinhard Heydrich was labelled Hitler's Hangman by Thomas Mann after his assassination, at the age of thirty eight. This excellent biography actually begins with his death in Prague, May 1942. The background to the assassination is examined in great detail, with the Czech underground under pressure to perform, despite (quite rightly as it turned out) fearing reprisals if Heydrich was the target.The book then turns to Heydrich's early life. He was born into a musical family of good financial means and social standing. During WWI his father was mentioned in a German encyclopaedia of music and musicians, published in 1916, as a Jewish composer. It turned out a former pupil of his fathers musical conservatory had inserted this as revenge for being expelled and it was removed from the next edition, but rumours of a Jewish background would plague Heydrich throughout his life.Rather than running his fathers business, Heydrich turned to the navy and found the rumours of a Jewish background followed him, making him an outsider - although playing the violin probably also helped to mark him out as different. However, he became a second naval liutenant and was both ambitious and arrogant. He met his future wife, Lina Von Osten in 1930, whose brother was an early member of the Nazi party. However, the relationship eventually led to his dismissal from the navy and left Heydrich at a loose end.It is hard to say whether, had Heydrich remained in the navy and not met Lina, he would have simply remained a career officer. However, an interview with Himmler changed his life. Himmler gave him a chance and Heydrich remained conscious of the debt he owed him and gave total loyalty. He was less qualified than the other applicant, but used his love of crime and spy novels to impress Himmler so much that he was offered the job of creating the SS intelligence agency.This biography looks at Heydrich's early career in the SS. Securing control over the Gestapo, the night of the long knives in 1934, kristallnacht and Heydrich's attacks on the church, the communists, the Jewish population and others. With the invasion of Poland, Heydrich unleashed a campaign of terror which exceeded anything he had managed before. He was also given the responsibility, by Hitler, of the maintenance of order in Germany 'at all costs'. In 1939 he issued the Principles of Inner State Security during the War and a ruthless approach to the threat of defeatism.Heydrich was convinced that only he could deal with the 'Jewish problem' and appointed Eichmann as special advisor carrying out evacuations in the East. He favoured a Jewish reservation in Madagascar, but this plan was dropped when sea routes could not be secured. The book goes on to look at the Wannsee Conference in 1942, set up by Heydrich when Goring authorised him to make all necessary preparations for a total solution of the Jewish question. Wannsee affirmed Heydrich's overall authority in dealing with the Jews, a responsibility he seems to have embraced without any kind of difficulty or being troubled about what he was asked to do.Hitler then decided to replace Baron von Neurath, his 'weak' representative in Prague with Heydrich. This was a man whose power was constantly growing - he had wealth, power and was the only leading SS officer occupying key positions at both the centre of the Nazi empire and on the territorial periphery. He travelled regularly between Prague and Berlin, taking up new challenges without meaning to lose any of his previous responsibilities. His time in Prague dealt huge blows to the people. He saw the Czech people as a race of slaves, considering education an unnecessary luxury and attempting to undermine and eradicate Czech culture and national identity. He pushed for cultural Germanization and stamped on resistance movements with harsh measures.When Heydrich was assassinated, his funeral was stage managed by Goebbels and the Nazi's sought revenge. The most well known act of retaliation was the complete annihilation of the Bohemian village of Lidice, where the assassins allegedly received support. Himmler also ordered his subordinates to take less risks, saying, after all we want to kill our enemies, our enemies are not supposed to kill us. The author goes on to tell us what happened to the assassins, the implications of the death of Heydrich and what happened to the people involved after the war. Lina, who survived, never expressed any regret or remorse for her husbands crimes. It is interesting to speculate on what would have happened had Heydrich survived - suicide in 1945 or Neuremberg perhaps? Either way, that the well brought up son of musicians ended up steeped in such savagery - embraced such violence - is staggering and this is a very well written and interesting account of his life and his death. Highly recommended.",
                    "An amazing biography of one of the most evil men of the Third Reich who surprisingly has not had as much written about him as have Hitler's other acolytes. Reinhard Heydrich came from an upper middle class, cultured, and musical family but turned to the Nazi party in 1931 and became one of the most violent and virulent anti-Semites in the party leadership. On his shoulders rests, at least in part, the responsibility for the final solution (more commonly known as The Holocaust) as he and his minions devised a plan for racial cleansing which has continued to horrify the world to the present day. He was assassinated in Prague in 1942 and his death caused Germany to visit mass retaliation on Czechoslovakia, especially the murder of all the citizens of Lidice and the razing of that village to the ground. The author had access to notes, diaries, meeting minutes and other documents to put together this unbiased and chilling biography of a man, who if he hadn't been assassinated, would have stood in the dock at Nuremberg and without a doubt been sentenced to death.",
                    "Heydrich is one of those Nazis who played an important role but held second level positions and are as a result mostly ignored by historians. Unlike Hitler, Speer, Goering or even Himmler there is little biographical work on Heydrich and he is either relegated to playing Himmler's talented sidekick or as head of SD in books dealing with that organisation.Gerwarth tries to correct that and does a decent job. Not great, mind you, but good enough. Book starts with Heydrich's assassination in 1942, rewinds to his childhood and teenage years, follows his rise through Nazi party hierarchy and involvement in repressive machinery, relations with key players in that field (Himmler, Hitler, Goering) and ends with Nazi retaliation for his death.Gerwarth doesn't put forward any controversial subjects or adresses any conspiracy theories such as had Himmler had a hand in his death (that is interfered with his post-assassination treatment) because he feared him as a rival, was his dismisal from navy part of Canaris' plot to gain inside man in Nazi security aparatus.... He simply collects and presents information about his life, his work and consequences.I assume it was hard for author to write biography of such a man and not pass judgement but Gerwarth managed to pull it off. Book presents action and allows reader to draw his own conclussion and judgement, something for which author should be commended.Mind you, this book does not uncover and new parts of Heydrich's life. Most of it was written in one form or another either in books covering Himmler's life, Nazi security aparatus (Heydrich's brainchild SD, SS, RSHA....) or Holocaust. It's worth noting that book goes in greater detail about his work as Protector of Bohemia and Moravia, the remains of Chechoslovakia left after 1938 Munich agreement and Slovak secession. While his rule is often described as carrot-and-stick Gerwarth argues it was plenty of a stick and little carrot.Overall a book that concentrates on the man himself, placing him in centre and not as head of organsation book covers or somebody operating some distance away from other person book deals with. Also worth reading if you are interested in second tier officials who held great degree of power but were conmstanly locked in struggles with people in similar positions in jungle that was Nazi Germany state bureaucracy."

                    "“Wherever this killer went, blood flowed in rivers. Everywhere, even in Germany, he was simply called: the Hangman.”-tThomas Mann’s obituary for Reinhard Heydrich, delivered on BBC radio, June 1942Close your eyes. Are they closed yet? Good. Now imagine a Nazi. Open your eyes. You just imagined Reinhard Tristan Eugen Heydrich. The Butcher of Prague. The Blonde Beast. The Hangman. Tall. Blonde. Blue-eyed. A hat decorated with a skull tilted jauntily on his head. Even in the murderous, psychopathic, utterly bankrupt regime of the Nazis, Heydrich stood out for his misdeeds. Hitler and Himmler don’t really frighten you. They are twisted little creatures. Hitler, scrawny and trembling. Himmler, chinless and bespectacled. Heydrich is different. He is a killer and looks the part. A butcher and a riddle. A face that is remarkably unperturbed about being as deadly is smallpoxHe was such a bastard that in 1942, two young Czech agents, trained by the British SOE, parachuted into German-occupied Czechoslovakia (which the Nazis called the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia) to end him. On May 27, 1942, the agents – Jan Kubiš and Josef Gabčík – ambushed Heydrich’s car as it slowed for a hairpin curve in Prague. Despite botching the mission (Gabčík’s gun jammed, Kubiš’s bomb bounced against the wheel of Heydrich’s car), they managed to wound the Nazi henchman, who later died of sepsis. Heydrich’s assassination (or judgment, if you prefer) comprises the opening chapter of Robert Gerwarth’s Hitler’s Hangman: The Life of Heydrich. This, I think, is a literary mistake. It’s been a long time since I took creative writing, but I’m pretty sure your dramatic highpoint isn’t supposed to be in the first ten pages. Then again, drama is not really Gerwarth’s métier. Hitler’s Hangman is factually solid, well-researched, and professionally presented. It is also inert. Flat. Not a bad read, per se, but unmemorable. The real-life Heydrich makes an impression – a bad one, but an impression nonetheless, strangely, this biography does not. There are a couple ways to do a biography. The first is to stick to a strictly factual approach. You lay out the events of a person’s life, picking and choosing the consequential moments. Most biographies are like this. Some are better researched or written than others. The other type of biography dares to do a bit more. It not only gives you the facts, but it imparts meaning to them. This kind of biography does more than tell you what happened, it ventures to tell you why. This kind of biography burrows so deep into its subject that you feel you’re in the room with them. Hitler’s Hangman is the first type of biography. It is factually sound and well-researched and its bibliography goes on for pages, yet it never hazards a theory as to what animated this monster in human form. In other words, this is the opposite of the mammoth Nazi biographies written by Peter Longerich that attempt to analyze and probe on top of everything else. At less than 300 pages, Hitler’s Hangman is rather streamlined. Partly, this may be of necessity. Perhaps Heydrich simply left fewer documents behind for his future biographers to mine for clues. (Longerich’s books on Himmler and Goebbels are certainly aided by the fact that his subjects kept diaries). At the same time, Gerwarth doesn’t spend a lot of time on the overall context. He doesn’t develop the secondary characters of Heydrich’s life. Most of the people that surround him remain shadows. As mentioned above, Gerwarth starts with Heydrich’s richly-deserved death. He then backtracks to the life of “young Reinhard.” These early chapters are a bit dull. Heydrich was a mediocrity, with no exceptional talents or skills. Moreover, Gerwarth makes no attempt to imbue these passages with any extra insight. There are a couple interesting takeaways. Heydrich’s father ran a renowned music conservatory, a position Heydrich might have taken had the world broken differently. Heydrich was also tossed out of the Weimar Republic’s neutered Reichsmarine for breaking off an engagement with a woman in order to pursue an entirely different one. Otherwise, not exactly an auspicious beginning.The fascinating thing about Heydrich’s Nazi career is that he sort of fell into it. Jobs were scarce, his father’s conservatory was going bankrupt, and he’d lost his naval career. When he secured a position in the growing Nazi movement, he did so for the paycheck. Heydrich, one of the most vicious and rabid Nazis, did not start as an ideologue. Later, of course, he drank the company Kool-Aid. At the time of his death, he was as committed as anyone to Germany’s program of ethnic cleansing. The best parts of Hitler’s Hangman, the parts that make it valuable to students of World War II and the Holocaust, document Heydrich’s role in the Final Solution. Gerwarth traces Heydrich’s career arc as he morphs from a non-dogmatic functionary trying to climb the corporate ladder to devoted mass-murderer, beloved by Himmler and Hitler. In doing so, Gerwarth also does a good job presenting the unfolding of the Holocaust in increments. The Final Solution was not birthed fully formed. It proceeded in fits and starts. The Nazis took baby steps towards the void, and every time they got away with something, they got a little closer to chambers pumped full of Zyklon B. There were wild colonization schemes, ad hoc pogroms, un-systematic shootings, and mobile gas vans, all this culminating in the death factories at Treblinka, Belzec, Sobibor, and Auschwitz-Birkenau. The places of death that force us to question humanity to this very day. Heydrich was right there for most of it, though the Holocaust really went into high gear following his death, in an operation (appropriately) named after him. Gerwarth succeeds in explaining Heydrich’s role in, and importance to, the Nazi’s fatal scheme. He is less successful in giving the reader any idea of Heydrich’s mindset. The book flap of Hitler’s Hangman promises to investigate the complexity of Heydrich’s character, but I didn't see any of that. I have no idea what any of this meant to him. Did he eventually come around to the belief that all Germany’s problems could be solved by annihilating Jews? Did he believe in Himmler’s breathtaking plans for remaking eastern Europe? Or was he just a psychotic striver, willing to do anything for a promotion, a raise, a pension? These questions are ultimately unanswerable. But they should be grappled with in some way. Gerwarth barely feints in that direction. The result is a rather straightforward bio that – unintentionally, of course – normalizes Heydrich. By treating him as just another run-of-the-mill historical figure, by checking off the highlights of his life, you start to forget that – holy crap! – this guy oversaw the deaths of millions of people. Millions. Of. People. And we don’t even know if he ever lost a wink of sleep. I don’t expect Gerwarth to include a picture of himself pissing on the remains of Heydrich’s grave. I don’t expect him to speculate wildly. But I needed something more – some deeper connection between the criminal and his crimes – to give this an unqualified recommendation.",
                    "UPDATE 1/2/18 ...The sections of this book covering the years from 1939 to 1942 provide a sickening portrait of Heydrich using mass murder of Jews as a means of career advancement ... Poland, Russia, Wannsee, Auschwitz... Heydrich understood better than some of the Wehrmacht's senior officers that those implementing the policies most attuned to Hitler's wishes would be rewarded with enhanced powers to enforce them.... Heydrich's Gestapo and SD had prepared for war against Poland since the spring of 1939. The Security Police would ‘neutralize’ centres of potential resistance and destroy those classes of society thought to be carriers of Polish nationalism. The card index was used to compile a ‘special arrest list’, which carried the names of some 61,000 Poles to be arrested or killed immediately. ... Behind the regular troops, Heydrich's SS task forces swiftly moved across the border and descended on Poland's civilian population, informing Heydrich personally of the ‘progress’ of their work through daily reports. The conquest of Poland, widely perceived by the Nazis as a racially inferior country, significantly expanded conceptions of what was possible and permissible.... Of the 16,000 Polish civilians killed during the first six weeks of the war, 5,000 were Jews. ... within the first few months of 1940, Eichmann was to ensure that 600,000 Jews from the annexed territories, ‘without regard to age and gender’, were deported into the General Government.... The Wehrmacht successfully used the Polish (SS) atrocities as an argument against any SS involvement on the Western Front. ... Nazi Germany's victorious campaigns in Western Europe thus constituted a setback for Heydrich.... new opportunity arose following Hitler's decision to attack the Soviet Union. Heydrich was determined not let this opportunity pass him by ... On 22 June 1941, a historically unprecedented invasion army of 3 million German soldiers … Heydrich's Einsatzgruppen followed in the armies’ rear, grimly determined to excel in carrying out their orders.... by the end of 1941, Germans and their local helpers had murdered between 500,000 and 800,000 Jewish men, women and children in the former Soviet territories, often between 2,700 and 4,200 per day, with most of the deaths resulting from shootings at close quarters.... Göring authorized Heydrich to make ‘all necessary preparations’ for a ‘total solution of the Jewish question in the German sphere of influence in Europe’. … he empowered Heydrich to submit a ‘comprehensive draft’ of a plan for the ‘final solution to the Jewish question’. ... On 20 January 1942, a snowy Tuesday morning, Heydrich gathered fourteen senior Nazi civil servants, party officials and high-ranking SS officers in a former industrialist's villa on the shores of Berlin's Lake Wannsee. As Heydrich indicated in his invitation letter of late November 1941, the purpose of the meeting was to establish ‘a common position among the central authorities’ in regard to the final solution... Heydrich outlined the scale of the task that lay ahead of them. Roughly 11 million Jews – including those living under German occupation, the Jews of neutral European states such as Turkey, Ireland and Sweden and those living in states still at war with Nazi Germany, such as Great Britain – would be affected by the final solution.***UPDATE 7/14/16 ...I just read the sections covering Reinhard Heydrich's activities from when Hitler became Chancellor in Jan 1933 until he helped Hitler murder over 200 opponents in what is known as the Night of the Long Knives in 1934. Gerwarth provides a very well done picture of Heydrich's role in the Nazi transition to a state were open opposition led to imprisonment and death and all good Germans were encouraged to spy on and denounce each other. Heydrich, who was briefly introduced in Book One of A FLOOD OF EVIL (just published) will be a central character in Book Two which I have just started writing.***I read the parts that correspond to the time line of my novel, ie, before spring 1933. Very well written. Of course the man is despicable.",
                    "How does one write a biography of a butcher, someone who committed atrocities? The author notes at the beginning that it is a difficult task, but one must understand the subject of a biography--even if the subject produces loathing. Robert Gerwarth's answer regarding Reinhard Heydrich, Hitler's Hangman, is what he calls cold empathy--(Page x): . . .an attempt to reconstruct Heydrich's life with critical distance, but without reading history backward or succumbing to the danger of confusing the role of historian with that of a state prosecutor at a war criminal's trial.This is, then, the story of one of Nazi Germany's most infamous figures. The story begins at the end of Heydrich's life, and then tells the tale from his childhood until that point in time. The story is well detailed, Gerwarth has mined the records well to come up with a full picture of Heydrich. His childhood certainly did not contain harbingers of the extermination of huge number of people for whose deaths he was responsible.His early career, too, did not suggest what he would become. His military career crashed and burned, he married well. Then, partially as a result of his wife's family, he began to be involved in the Nazi regime. Because of his competence and certitude of his own talent, he rose through the ranks. As he rose, he became more fanatical in his ideology and helped lead toward the effort of a final solution to the Jewish problem (or the Gypsy problem or the Czech problem or. . .). The book details his ferocious political infighting to maintain and expand his power. It chronicles his political victories--and defeats.In the end, this is a powerful biography. If one wants to understand Heydrich the Hangman, this is a terrific resource, so well documented. Five stars."

                    "Analyzing the previously unexplored religious views of the Nazi elite, Richard Steigmann-Gall argues against the consensus that Nazism as a whole was either unrelated to Christianity or actively opposed to it. In contrast, Steigmann-Gall demonstrates that many in the Nazi movement believed the contours of their ideology were based on a Christian understanding of Germany's ills and their cure. He also explores the struggle the \"positive Christians\" waged with the party's paganists and demonstrates that this was not just a conflict over religion, but over the very meaning of Nazi ideology itself. Richard Steigmann-Gall is assistant professor of history at Kent Sate University. He earned his BA and MA at the University of Michigan, and PhD at the University of Toronto. He has earned fellowships and awards from the Social Science and Humanities Research Council of Canada, the Sassoon International Center for the Study of Antisemitism in Israel, and the Max-Planck Institut fur Geschichte in Gottingen.

                    "Steigmann-Gall challenged scholarship stressing the anti-christian nature of National Socialism by arguing that point 24 of the NSDAP platform highlights the ways in which the Nazis saw themselves as part of the wider Christian community. Until 1937, Nazis made an active attempt to attract protestant membership. Protestants were seen as more nationally German than Catholics, and veneration of heroes such as Martin Luther was common. Only after 1937 did Bormanns influence on the party lead to a loss of power for Christians. Even then, they continued to appeal to point 24.So far so good. As academic reviewers noted, however, Steigmann-Gall underestimated the influence of polytheism and paganism in the Nazi ranks, taking the occasional pro-Christian statement of men like Han F.K. Günther wildly out of context. Nazis often used Christian language without any deep rooted Christian beliefs. Nazism was a fundamentally anti-christian movement.",
                    "Thoroughly enjoyed this book, and I value the work the author put into researching and writing it. The myth that the Nazis were anti-christian, pagan, or even atheist is far too common even among educated people. On the whole, the author provides strong evidence that the Nazi regime was either Christian or at least highly supportive of Christianity. The issues were far more with the contradictions of protestantism and Catholicism than Christianity itself. Many members also had problems with the institutions of Christianity, but not the religion itself. There was a pagan faction with Nazism, but its influence is highly exaggerated. There was absolutely no Atheist faction. Hitler's Table Talks are often used as definitive proof that Hitler was not Christian, but closer examination shows this is far less clear. While he did heavily criticize Christianity at times, he also still highly praised Jesus as a warrior against Jewish Materialism. Overall, excellent history. Highly recommend.",
                    "Magnificent, crystal clear study. Decades of research, irrefutable logic, and entertaining style. Recommended.",
                    "Intriguing analysis of religion within the Weimar Republic and Nazi Germany. Great job at exploring internal party politics and the conflict between differing factions and churches.",
                    "Steigmann-Gall's research feels like second and third source material from which he pulled information that conformed to his theory of why Jews were picked for the holocaust. It made me go on a research journey of my own through mounds of WWII, German/Nazi/Hitler/Holocaust material as well as Protestantism, Martin Luther and scads of associated stuff on world religions in order to sift through it all and balance competing perspectives. If there was a 'holy reich' it was not Steigmann-Gall's, but a psychopathic deviant's dream of supreme authority. The structure around this satantic 'god' looked a helluva lot like a hierarchical 'church."

                    "The Last Train, is the harrowing true story about young brothers Paul and Oscar Arato and their mother, Lenke, surviving the Nazi occupation during the final years of World War II.,Living in the town of Karcag, Hungary, the Aratos feel insulated from the war â€” even as it rages all around them. Hungary is allied with Germany to protect its citizens from invasion, but in 1944 Hitler breaks his promise to keep the Nazis out of Hungary.,The Nazi occupation forces the family into situations of growing panic and fear: first into a ghetto in their hometown; then a labor camp in Austria; and, finally, to the deadly Bergen Belsen camp deep in the heart of Germany. Separated from their father, 6-year-old Paul and 11-year-old Oscar must care for their increasingly sick mother, all while trying to maintain some semblance of normalcy amid the horrors of the camp.,In the spring of 1945, the boys see British planes flying over the camp, and a spark of hope that the war will soon end ignites. And then, they are forced onto a dark, stinking boxcar by the Nazi guards. After four days on the train, the boys are convinced they will be killed, but through a twist of fate, the train is discovered and liberated by a battalion of American soldiers marching through Germany.,The book concludes when Paul, now a grown man living in Canada, stumbles upon photographs on the internet of his train being liberated. After writing to the man who posted the pictures, Paul is presented with an opportunity to meet his rescuers at a reunion in New York â€” but first he must decide if he is prepared to reopen the wounds of his past."

                    "Finished in one day. I’ll read anything on the Holocaust and this one taught me new things from the Hungarian perspective. 🇭🇺🇭🇺🇭🇺",
                    "Very good story of a family and their survival.",
                    "Very touching true Holocaust survival story. First book that I have read relating to Holocaust survival of the person so close to home. The released authors autographed book was loaned to me by my friend. I read and watched several movies of the holocaust, however so close to home felt very horrifying and real. This book is a short version of a very large inhuman treatment of Jews. It was heart breaking true story of a family torn apart by the war and very few lived to relate their living nightmare. Hope history never ever repeats itself. It is amazing that such evil people live within us. I recall a poem How odd/ of God/ to choose/ the Jews relating to the holocaust. Strange I should remember this poem now.",
                    "How do you tell a story of the Holocaust when the subject was just 6 years old when it ended? When those memories are indistinct and questionable.You call it fiction and move it to the perspective of his brother, who protected him and helped him survive.The real history of this story is the liberation of a death train and the Americans who saved them. They say, very straightforwardedly- they thought that the descriptions were just anti Nazi propaganda...until they opened the death train.Not a good book, but an important one.",
                    "The authors husband is the very young boy who endures the confusing events of the holocaust with his mother and brother. The eyes of this boy see things both illogical and surreal, and yet that is their reality. A final overcrowded train shuttle is the site of an eleventh hour rescue by soldiers who later come to a reunion with survivors of that event. So much horror is left unmentioned as it is after all a children's book. Yet is a harrowing and horrific event in the life of this one little family in the midst of a long and bloody war. So many have not talked of the war and now they are gone. I am grateful that the author Rona Arato was able to draw this story from her husband's early life so it could be shared with us. I read it on November 11th, the weekend of the 100th anniversary of the first world war. Are things getting better? Sometimes it is hard to comprehend just how many evils in the world have stalked young people and scarred their lives. It is hauntingly scary when hatreds resurface in mass killings as has happened this year. ",
                    "One Hungarian family’s true story of surviving through Nazi roundups, cattle-car deportations, forced labor, disease, and worse during the last year of WWII in Europe. Based on accounts from her husband, Paul, whose family’s story this is, Arato creates a sense of horror seen and felt by Paul when he was aged 10 to 11 (about the age as the book’s intended readership). The horrors described here, it should be noted, are not outlined in gruesome detail. We know some people die of typhus, for instance, but not what they looked like or suffered, same with the Nazis. While it’s clear that these are seriously bad people, hope is a thread that runs throughout the story, love of family, another. The book’s (tested) optimism shines out not just because of the love within the Auslander family that helped them survive and stay together, but also because of the gratitude shown their rescuers, a bunch of young American soldiers. And 65 years later, Paul was able again to meet and thank the GIs who had rescued his family.",
                    "In this book, the author, Rona Arato, doesn't just demonstrate the childhood of Paul Auslander, but it also shows the suffering of being a Jew during World War II. In the book, Arato utilizes the third point of view to narrate the book. From her words, we can see how were Nazi torturing Jews during the end of World War II. In the story, we can even experience the starvation, fatigue, and pain of Paul, Oscar, and other Jews. In the end, the readers can also understand the freedom and happiness that the US army and alliance brought to them from the concentration camp, from suffering. Personally, I'm not a huge fan reading book like this. The reason is it creates an image which people are suffering and creates sad and frustrating feelings inside the reader. However, I still like to learn some history about World War II. As a result, I recommend this book to people who are interested in WWII history and the Holocaust or people who want to know what is life looked like back in the time. ",
                    "Very interesting read……Read a lot of Holocaust stories and found this one told from this young boy in the family made it that way. Especially so because his story was a little more unique to other stories. I am sure each horrific story during the War is unique in its own.Also interested to read what followed to this family immediately after the war. You are able to witness some of their journey back home to Hungary. They do not just pack up and get home. That was somewhat of a struggle too. "

                    "The Nazi Campaign to Delegitimize the JewsThe Nazis, contends Berkowitz, used the metaphor of criminality both as cover and justification for their policy of ethnic cleansing, making it an essential component of their anti-Jewish propaganda. Constant repetition and the use of visual imagery had the effect of embedding Jewish criminality as a meme, and with it the notion that as criminals the rights of Jews were slim to nonexistent. To facilitate this projection, head braces were developed to guarantee that the angle of mug shots of Jewish prisoners would emphasize a criminal nature. Nazi laws, some not even published, made it difficult for a Jew not to be guilty of some violation, whether it was walking with one's hands in one's pocket along the river or attempting to emigrate without registering every single possession or possession of sums larger than pocket change. In most cases these were just pretexts which were dispensed with in the mass arrests and executions that followed.Berkowitz also looks at the conditions in the camps and the role of the Judenrat and other prisoners in controlling the Jewish population of the enforced ghettos and in the camps. Often the Nazis would select people of poor character as their intermediaries, then exploit the optics of a situation that they themselves had created as evidence of innate Jewish evil, citing evidence how they dealt with each other. Ironically, when it came to the camps, some Jewish prisoners were saved from selection for the gas chambers, even at the last minute, because they had entered the camps as prisoners rather than Jews.In the last year of the war, with few Jews left, the Nazis worried that the younger generation would lose their enthusiasm for National Socialism's mission, and so they turned to vilifying Zionism. It is interesting to note that this idea was floated by Alfred Rosenberg but did not get approved into the general propaganda mill. The Nazis knew the lack of power and influence of the Zionist movement through the Ha-avera Agreement, and had completely infiltrated their intelligence network. They did not consider Zionism a credible threat, instead focusing on World Jewry as puppeteering Bolsheviks and Capitalists. However in February 1944 both Helmut Sundermann and Otto Dietrich (rather than rival Goebbels who showed little interest in this line ) began to draw on the work of one Wolf Meyer-Christian who had been focusing on Zionism since the Peel Commission of '37 and in turn promoted the works of analyst Giselher Wirsing (English, Jews, Arabs in Palestine, 1938). With prescience Wirsing proclaims that neither pan-Arabism nor pan-Islamism are likely to succeed in the short term without Nazi help. In 1944 Meyer-Christian offers that anti-Semitism is not only foundational to National Socialism and one of the Nazis most potent tools, but going forward should also be part of a post war strategy.The final two chapters considers the of the book considers the situation of Jews as displaced persons (DPs) in the aftermath of the war, concentration on the American Zone. Total number of Jewish DPs were estimated at 250,000, with about half under the Americans. Though liberated, many were still interred due to a perceived threat of Jewish disease (typhoid, STDs) and Jewish crime. Again Jews are portrayed as negatively as criminals, largely because of their participation in the black and grey markets. Abe Klausner, a Jewish Army Chaplain, was candid about the problems in the camps and communicated with the Jewish Joint Distribution Committee on the need for rehabilitation programs. However he failed to see these activities themselves as rehabilitative and took a rather straight laced view towards rooting out the problem On the other hand, Philip Bernstein, an advisor to Generals Joseph McNarney, Lucious Clay and Mark Clark emphasized the use of clemency and understanding. The Jews who had survived had done so largely by subverting the unbending rules that had been applied against them. Moreover Jewish criminality was no different than any other group, with the interesting exception of 50% lower rates of violent crime. Bernstein inverted the accusation Why are there so many Jewish criminals into to what extent is Judaism responsible for the prevention of crime and delinquency among Jews. As such he was able to add some degree of sensitivity to the handling of relations between the American Occupation forces and their post war use of German policing wrt Jewish survivors.A worthwhile read to understand how anti-Semitic tactics can be made to resonate and persist by the repetition of false labels. The insights on the social structure of the DPs after the war were both unexpected from the title and extremely interesting as this is a topic that is rarely covered. "

                    "Hungarian Imre Kertész was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature in 2002 for “writing that upholds the fragile experience of the individual against the barbaric arbitrariness of history.” His conversation with literary historian Thomas Cooper that is presented here speaks specifically to this relationship between the personal and the historical. In The Holocaust as Culture,Kertész recalls his childhood in Buchenwald and Auschwitz and as a writer living under the so-called soft dictatorship of communist Hungary. Reflecting on his experiences of the Holocaust and the Soviet occupation of Hungary following World War II, Kertész likens the ideological machinery of National Socialism to the oppressive routines of life under communism. He also discusses the complex publication history of Fateless, his acclaimed novel about the experiences of a Hungarian child deported to Auschwitz, and the lack of interest with which it was initially met in Hungary due to its failure to conform to the communist government’s simplistic history of the relationship between Nazi occupiers and communist liberators. The underlying theme in the dialogue between Kertész and Cooper is the difficulty of mediating the past and creating models for interpreting history, and how this challenges ideas of self. The title The Holocaust as Culture is taken from that of a talk Kertész gave in Vienna for a symposium on the life and works of Jean Améry. That essay is included here, and it reflects on Améry’s fear that history would all too quickly forget the fates of the victims of the concentration camps. Combined with an introduction by Thomas Cooper, the thoughts gathered here reveal Kertész’s views on the lengthening shadow of the Holocaust as an ever-present part of the world’s cultural memory and his idea of the crucial functions of literature and art as the vessels of this memory."

                    "Let me tell you at the outset that it is my first Imre Kertesz. And that is a disadvantage. For it is a book in which one gets an idea as to why Kertesz chose a particular style in his quasi-autobiographical novels/novellas. Having read no book by Kertesz till now, I was clearly handicapped. I am planning to read one soon and I believe this will give the necessary foundation.About this book: I will not bother with many of my impressions for I feel I am not yet qualified to make them. But just an observation: Imre Kertesz was a Holocaust survivor. He survived Auschwitz. And what is his take on Auschwitz? He states that Auschwitz is not necessarily a 'historical' event. It is in fact a culture. He writes: Our age is not the age of anti-Semitism but of Auschwitz. And the anti-Semite of our age no longer spurns Jews, rather he longs for Auschwitz.....In order to murder millions of Jews, the totalitarian state needs not anti-Semites but good organizers. We must be clear: no totalitarian party or state can exist without discrimination, and the totalitarian form of discrimination is necessarily mass murder.Kertesz says, and I think rightly so, that Auschwitz is anytime and anywhere possible. Because it was a human endeavour for which both the masters as well as the victims (willing to adapt to the prisons and today to totalitarian regimes) contributed. Now, it seems to be not visible. But that is the culture we have given birth to.He writes: We speak of collective guilt, the collective guilt of the German nation. But Auschwitz is the collective crime of the entire world, not just of the German nation. If we think of the Holocaust as a war between Germans and Jews then we will never understand it.Last Note: Recently there was the referendum in Britain to decide whether to remain in EU or to leave. The result: 'LEAVE' campaign won. After the announcement of the result there were many incendiary remarks against the people of other nationalities. Before this there was a pogrom in Gujarat (a state in India) in which Muslim people were systematically annihilated. Then there was a civil war in Sri Lanka where Tamil ethnic group was at the mercy of the Sinhala majority. Kertesz seems to be making a very valid point. This culture longs for Auschwitz. I am shaking with fear as I write this.",

                    "This slim 78-page book contains, in addition to the title essay (an address given in Vienna in 1992 as part of the Jean Amery Symposium), an essay by Thomas Cooper entitled Imre Kertesz and the Post-Auschwitz Condition (2011) and A Conversation with Imre Kertesz (2010) between Cooper and Kertesz. Cooper's essay deal primarily with Kertesz's novel Fatelessness (also known as Fateless), while the conversation focuses on depictions of the Holocaust as well as how Fatelessness was shaped and made possible by the author living under the Kadar communist regime in Hungary. To me the conversation is the most interesting of the three, but I would only recommend reading this if you have already read Fatelessness and have a certain familiarity with Holocaust literature."

                    "This is an essay-length book, not a book-length essay, as it's described elsewhere. It's actually two essays and an interview. Skip the first essay, by Cooper. It's publish-or-perish resume-padding stuffed with empty jargon, mainly the word narrative which the author apparently hates with a passion and wants to overwork into an early grave. More power to him.The interview and second essay, on the other hand, are so dense with insight that you have to read them slowly to digest them. The book is short (50 pages, if you skip the first essay), so I won't summarize except to say this: Kertesz explains why post-WWII antisemitism is so desperate to deny the Holocaust, and the answer is so obvious that you'll kick yourself when you read it.",

El libro es largo, de hojas bíblicas. Cada entrevista es diferente, con una edición distinta y un enfoque adaptado al humor del entrevistado (y del entrevistador). Todos niegan saber lo que ocurría. Y si aceptan saberlo, estaban siguiendo órdenes. Y si se les reprocha su falta de valentía por no detener algo que les causaba repulsión, la guerra es la guerra y no se puede hacer nada. Pero hay algo más inquietante. No se trata de las justificaciones ni de la paranoia del gigante ruso que quiere invadir el mundo, sino del comportamiento infantil de acusados y testigos.

                    "On May 7, 1945, Germany officially surrendered, as authorized by the then current Flensburg president Karl Donitz. Between the months of May to October the Allied Forces apprehended and interned various major war criminals of the Third Reich, from the likes of the hedonistic Goering to the abysmal Ernst Kaltenbrunner. Initially all the defendants spare Gustav Krupp and Martin Bormann were detained at a health spa in Bad Mondorf to avoid international scrutiny. On October 1945, Airey Neave, a British officer served upon the 22 remaining defendants a copy of the indictment. Robert Ley, head of the German Labour Front, committed suicide, as he expressed his indignation at being considered a war criminal. Leon Goldensohn, an American military psychiatrist, was acquisitioned with the task of interviewing these men of the 21 present only 19 granted him access to personal discussions, Erich Raeder, former admiral of the German Navy declined on the basis that he was already tended to by another health professional and Arthur Seyss-Inquart denied him for reasons unknown, presumably because Goldensohn was Jewish.What’s most irritating about the developments and machinations of these men’s psychology is that their catharsis is hampered by cheap, philosophical detachment and endless rationalizations, spare perhaps Albert Speer and Rudolf Hess, as the former had come to terms with his wartime activities and the latter to delusional behaviour which is worthy of its own story, however I digress. The interviews are categorized alphabetically, Karl Donitz’ interviews are the first in a series that the reader is subjected to. Donitz who then stood as the highest ranked Nazi (in conjunction with Hitler’s will) offers an evasive, but partially honest perspective on WWII and the Third Reich. Donitz was not a part of the final solution or civil persecution as he was Admiral of the Kriegsmarine (navy) and thus wasn’t privy to the exploits of the SS. Donitz (as espoused by almost every other defendant) shifts the blame constantly, one moment Hitler’s culpable, the next moment Himmler and Bormann. He does however offer an eerie prediction about Russia’s insatiable lust for total power, opining that America’s security will be at stake and its liberty jeopardized. Donitz received ten years imprisonment.Another defendant who demands intrigue is the truly reprehensible Ernst Kaltenbrunner. Kaltenbrunner is described as a gaunt lumbering giant of a man whose, thin, razor smile conveys an inescapable evil, often quelled by Kaltenbrunner’s incessant need to place his lower lip over his top. Kaltenbrunner was chief of the RSHA, Intelligence and Interpol, in his capacity crimes of mass murder, kidnapping, thievery and torture was ascribed to him. Kaltenbrunner proves the most banal and fruitless, expounding upon America’s OSS and international security, negating the dreadful acts he committed as Himmler’s number two man. Kaltenbrunner was sentenced to death by hanging, thus bringing the reader to a vital moral and ethical question: capital punishment. Interestingly, several men on the prosecution opposed the death penalty, notably chief prosecutor Robert Jackson. However, the reader has to come to the realization that the death penalty as constituted in the IMT’s legal charter, is less concerned with matters of redundant justice than it is with the fact that so many of these men were beyond redemption. It is true that Julius Streicher, publisher of an anti-Semitic newspaper, received a disproportionate sentence to his crimes and was condemned to death, whereas Hjalmar Schacht, former president of the economy, funded Hitler’s government by international loans and reduced the German economy to near financial disaster by poor fiscal mismanagement is acquitted of all charges.What I have covered thus far is brief, but that only serves as a testament to how densely rich and academically satisfying this book is. The book akin to the defendants and witnesses is horrifying, tedious, intriguing, surreal and shameful.",
                    "This book could easily have been titled I had nothing to do with THAT.The Nuremberg Interviews is an intense read with complex dynamics. On the one hand, there are psychiatrist Leon Goldensohn's efforts to understand his Nazi subjects who are either standing trial or serving as witnesses. Goldensohn asks probing questions to both establish psychological profiles and to also try to understand how they rationalized an aggressive war coupled with genocide. He doesn't seem like a passive 'pipe in the mouth' type of psychologist - instead, he confrontationally pushes his subjects like a surrogate prosecuting attorney. On the other hand, there are the incarcerated 'patients' who are eager to speak to Goldensohn, but often less eager to take responsibility for their crimes. Given an opportunity to expound their cases, the Nazis frequently sound rational and, to some degree, innocent. But Goldensohn doesn't let them off the hook quite so easily when he can see right through their lies and BS. At about 450 pages, The Nuremberg Interviews is often tedious and repetitive. Most of the Nazis who were on the militaristic side claim to have little or no knowledge nor responsibility concerning of the events of the Holocaust. Without a counter argument, it's hard to dispute their claims. Most of the defendants charged with crimes against humanity state that they were just following orders or had no choice. Or, if they were more closely associated with atrocities, they would cite all of their other job responsibilities that prevented them from taking part in murder, torture and other reprehensible acts. In the end, their meandering logical leaps, callousness, and denial of culpability is enough to turn your stomach. They conveniently blame the dead or missing Hitler, Himmler, Heydrich and Bormann for the mass murders and put a cherry on top by saying how reprehensible these activities were. Goldensohn challenges these statements while readers can draw their own conclusions. This is a scholarly study at times, and in its tedium it's often difficult to recall the Q&amp,A of each subject. That said, Rudolph Hoess (commandant at Auschwitz) and Julius Streicher (publisher of Der Sturmer) provided the most disturbing and harrowing personal reflections of their ideologies and actions. Fortunately for us, they were both executed shortly after the interviews.Note that Goldensohn had no hand in the publication of this book. He died in 1961, many years before the publication of the book. His widow and scholars assembled the book based on his notes from the interviews. So, other than being a Jewish American in Nuremberg, Goldensohn had no ulterior motives for fame or riches. Which is something that gives the book a level of purity."

                    "The chief value in The Nuremberg Interviews comes from the views, perspectives, and at times, candid reflections offered by the 33 defendants and witnesses whom Dr. Goldensohn (then a U.S. Army psychiatrist) interviewed during 1946. In reading this book, I felt as if I were in company with Dr. Goldensohn and his interpreter as he carried our his enquiries of each person. Hermann Goering, nominally the Number 2 man in the Third Reich, didn't strike me as a person given to much introspection or regret. Rather, he came across as a man who enjoyed wielding power and showed no contrition about the Holocaust and several of the other crimes committed by Hitler, whom he regarded largely as a genius. On the other hand, Rudolf Hoess, the commandant of Auschwitz, showed no evasiveness when speaking about his responsibility for the extermination of 5 million people. He fully accepted his guilt and the likelihood he would be hanged for his crimes (which took place in Poland in 1947). For any reader interested in understanding the mindsets and philosophies of individuals who served a totalitarian state, I strongly recommend this book. ",
                    "What Goldensohn was able to pry from the collection of Nazi defendants at Nuremberg—after considerable coaxing and between-the-lines analysis in some cases, simply directing and recording the logorrheic flow in others—is ofttimes banal, occasionally insightful, frequently delusional, haltingly confessional, and invariably self-serving: that is, it's very real and immediate and readable. Through their own words, each interviewed internee reveals a culpability ranged across a spectrum whose upper bands radiate monstrousness: and not a single one—however they protest, plead, or prevaricate—comes off clean.One of the more interesting things about this book was the discovery, in the introduction, that the US and British were in unity upon a policy of summary executions for the Nazi leadership—the idea of pursuing convictions through trials having first been raised by Molotov in the Soviet camp. After Stalin allegedly in jest announced that wiping out 50,000 Nazi officials and military officers should do the trick—and to which Roosevelt surely in jest suggested 49,000 as a more copacetic tally in the face of an appalled Churchill's protestations—all sides were moved, with US Secretary of War Stimson's voice the foremost, to effect a tribunal that would try the main leadership, and, in so-doing, establish an important precedent in the realm of international criminal law.",
                    "On November 19, 1945 The International Military Tribunal opened at the Palace of Justice in Nuremberg, Germany to hear the cases of twenty-two Nazis within seven organizations indicted on four charges – conspiracy to commit crimes, crimes against peace, war crimes, and crimes against humanity. Of the twenty-two individuals standing trial three were acquitted, twelve were sentenced to death, three were given life sentences, and four were given sentences ranging from 10-20 years. During the trial Dr. Eli Golensohn, a psychiatrist for the U.S. Army, interviewed both defendants and witnesses. The Nuremberg Interviews is a compilation of Dr. Golensohn’s copious notes from interviews with nineteen defendants and fourteen witnesses. While the prospect of a peek into the mind of high profile Nazi war criminals like Hermann Goering and Albert Speer is tantalizing, the most interesting aspect of the book in my opinion is the debate between Roosevelt, Churchill, and Stalin on how to go about seeking justice. All three at one time favored summary execution. The concept of a trial was actually first suggested by Soviet Foreign Minister Vyacheslav Molotov as far back as October 14, 1942 and was vociferously advocated by U.S. Secretary of War Henry Stimson, who insisted on the need to avoid the impression that the Allies were seeking vengeance. Ironically, it was Stalin who was the first of the leaders to embrace the trial concept and had FDR not died paving the way for Harry Truman to ascend to the presidency execution very well may have ruled the day. It was during this read that it dawned on me just how difficult it was for these three countries to forge a path forward deciding on the procedures that would ultimately govern the trial. After all, the three countries have vastly different judicial systems and compromise ruled the day. For instance, defendants were not granted anything resembling 5th Amendment protection and were required to answer all questions posed, a concept which is anathema to the US justice system. The other item I learned was that it was the organizations (the Reich cabinet, SS, SA, SD, and Gestapo) that were charged under the indictments rather than specific individuals. Unfortunately, the interviews themselves were not that enlightening. The reading became redundant, as each defendant used similar defense strategies – the government was disorganized and I didn’t know anything, I don’t hate Jews, I have friends that are Jews, and it was someone else’s fault. The most delusional was Herman Goering who had the audacity to state, “But always my intention was to contribute these art treasures, paintings, pieces of sculpture, altarpieces, jewels, et cetera, to a state museum after I had died, for the greater glory of German culture. Looking at it from that standpoint I can’t see that is was ethically wrong. IT was not as if I accumulated art treasures in order to sell them or to become a rich man. I love art for art’s sake and as I said, my personality demanded that I be surrounded with the best specimens of the world’s art.” (pg. 163) I suppose the most interesting part of the interviews was how clearly evident the ramifications of the Versailles Treaty were on the psyche of individual Germans. Historians have correctly pointed to this has a precursor to the rise of Nazism and Hitler but hearing it these defendants words makes the case even stronger. I would only recommend this book to those who have a prior understanding of the individual subjects of the book. The author doesn’t provide enough background to give good context for the conversation or the verdict and it could be confusing for those without a good basis of knowledge of the characters. ",
                    "What were they like? Manipulative to the extreme - playing their peers, their interviewer(s), themselves - not, generally, a nice bunch of people. Some were intellectually far ahead of others, and drew conclusions about the course of history which panned out that lets them appear terribly convincing, yet cynical and coldly calculating beyond belief. Others were merely cruel and narrow minded and yes, why not, a bit dim. Not a pleasant read but an eye opener about the human condition. Don't be fooled, people like that are out there. ",
                    "Inicialmente achei o livro muito interessante e até misterioso de certa forma, mas quanto mais lia mais o interesse se ia perdendo. O livro divide-se em 2 partes, os acusados e os testemunhas. Depois de ler sobre as entrevistas que mais me despertaram curiosidade como Walther Funk, Hermann Goering, Ernst Kaltenbrunner, Joachim von Ribbentrop, Alfred Rosenberg... fiquei com sensação que o livro podia estar finalizado nessa parte. Entretanto, quando me deparei com a parte dos Testemunhas, basicamente só nomes como Rudolf Hoess e Otto Ohlendorf, é que de certa forma tiveram algo de diferente, talvez seja pela gravidade dos crimes que cometeram. É um livro que se torna bastante repetitivo e por vezes cansativo porque as entrevistas no fundo são muito superficiais e os arguidos não procuram falar verdade mas sim defender-se (Apesar das entrevistas não serem registadas para os seus processos). Aconselho este livro para quem se interessa pela 2ª Guerra Mundial e especialmente pela Alemanha Nazi. As personalidades na sua maioria são interessantes e de certa forma o livro ajuda o leitor a entender o percurso do Nacional-Socialismo e a evolução das políticas Nazi antes e no decorrer da 2ª Guerra Mundial. Antes de se ler este livro, apelo a alguma leitura sobre o Tratado de Versalhes, os 14 pontos de Wilson, as leis de Nuremberga, os 'Pogroms' de 1938 e a própria 2ª Guerra Mundial. Numa apreciação geral, é bom livro, especialmente para nos lembrarmos das atrocidades que aconteceram para que não se voltem a repetir. "

                    "\"A valuable service . . . serious, entertaining, provocative and distinctive.\" --Cleveland Plain Dealer ,In the fifty years since his suicide amid the ruins of Berlin, Adolf Hitler has been the subject of more biographies than any comparable figure of our time--and at the center of a crucial historical debate over the nature of evil and moral responsibility in the twentieth century. In this brilliant and original book, the historian John Lukacs climbs above the fray to produce a definitive \"history of a history: the history of the evolution of our understanding of Hitler's life and our debates about its meaning.\",Like an expert attorney, Lukacs puts the biographies on trial, identifying their strengths, weaknesses, and hidden agendas. And through their intersecting and conflicting accounts, he addresses the enduring enigmas surrounding the demiurge of the Third Reich. Was Hitler a revolutionary or a reactionary? How successful was he as a statesman and a strategist? What was his primary motive for the extermination of the Jews? The Hitler of History answers these questions as fully as any modern work can hope to, with an intellectual boldness that makes it absolutely essential to any understanding of the post-Hitler world.,\"Lukacs is a shrewd historian and an engaging writer . . . a sharp and sober portrait.\" --Philadelphia Inquirer"

                    "This is high-octane Hitlerology. But Mr Lukacs' vast learning is spat out like a series of aggravating orange pips you didn't expect to find in your mouth. He swats historians like blowflies on a hot day in Alabama. Thwap! goes Toland. Splot! goes Irving. He regards the resulting mess with icy indifference. He surveys Alp after Alp of Hitler history with Olympian hauteur, and if you can't keep up with him, if you don't know your Hillgrubers from your Gorlitz-Quints, or your Intentionalists from your Functionalists, or indeed your schreibfests from your Joachim Fests, then you're in the wrong part of the train, second class is that way, move along please.This was a reread, but alas, I still felt that this book was well above my paygrade most of the time. He's so contemptuous about those who call Nazis fascists. Huh, of course they weren't! He thinks it's positively infantile to call the Third Reich totalitarian - no! it was authoritarian, idiot - now don't you forget it. Still, as the old adage has it, A cat may look at a king where cat = P Bryant and king = J Lukacs. So, frinstance, p176 :It was because of Hitler that anti-Semitism became unacceptable, if not unthinkable, intellectually as well as politically, after the warThis book was published in 1998 and even so I say : really? Unacceptable to who? Not to Hamas, not to the Iranian revolutionists of the 1970s and 80s and not to the Nation of Islam, to name a few serious political organisations. He comes out with some ringing paragraphs every now and again – this is a typical thundering and slightly off-kilter example:It is not only that Hitler had very considerable intellectual talents. He was also courageous, self-assured, on many occasions steadfast, loyal to his friends and those working for him, self-disciplined and modest in his physical wants. What this suggests ought not to be misconstrued, mistaken or misread. It does not mean : lo and behold! Hitler was only 50% bad. Human nature is not like that. A half-truth is worse than a lie, because a half-truth is not a 50% truth, it is a 100% truth and a 100% untruth mixed together. In mathematics, with its rigidly fixed and immobile numbers, 100 plus 100 equals 200, in human life 100 plus 100 makes another kind of 100. So this is not a history of Hitler, and it's not even a history of the history of Hitler, although that's what Mr Lukacs says it is. It's actually a series of grumpy, irritable, densely-packed, often oblique notes and opinions and apercus about the history of Hitler which are footnoted half to death on every page.",
                    "Lukacs delves into areas others fear to tread and asks some awkward questions about our perceptions of Hitler. His nit-picking at biographies uncovers authors intentions and reveals that even some of the best respected and most highly regarded of historians have on occassion faltered in their facts and figures (and that some have even used innacurate research by holocaust deniers!). This book has certainly made me rethink my view of Hitler, although I still disagree with Lukacs well-argumented case that we should consider Hitler a revolutionary rather than a reactionary (although his catogarizing Hitler as an idealist determinist is unarguable). The only down side to this book is the author's assumption that all readers are fluent in German, which makes some of his references difficult to understand without a German-English dictionary.",
                    "John Lukacs is the most entertaining author about WWII and Hitler especially. The most interesting thing about him is his way of thinking. He always take usual view back. He is an assumed reactionnary. How right is he when he forbids calling Hitler a reactionnary ? Very fine. Lukacs describes him as a very clever, modern guy. He assumes Hitler was not antisemitic, and even not a racist. He was just a völkish, that means populist, judeophobic and a nationalist. Lukacs situes Hitler in the new wave of populism that araises through the world after WWI. Hitler's Kampf is not about race, but about nation, and the nation Hitler fights for is Germany, not aryans. Lukacs purpose contrasts heavily with academic books (such as Kershaw etc). But surely he is far more interesting. From where comes his freedom of speech ? Rehabilitating Hitler in a way, as a jewish himself, having suffered WWII personnally, Lukacs is surely free of talking what he wants about it. Unlike every other authors (Kershaw etc) he lived this period, he knew that time. In my opinion he is the only author to read, if you have only one to read, about Hitler and WWII. Very good also is the way of rehabilitating forgotten authors like Joachim Fest (very good biography of Hitler). Lukacs is definitely the author to read about WWII and Hitler. He's so inspiring. Your view of Hitler would change and been a lot enriched. Hitler was not a devil, a bad, a vilain , he was just a man with his part of good and bad things. For example, Lukacs recalls the achievements of nazi era in social and economic policy. Lukacs recalls that the german middle class starting flavoured with Hitler. Hitler stopped the negative spiral Germany was plunged in since 1918 and 1929. Yet he lost his war. Bad things started when Hitler realized he could not win this war. As soon as 1941 summer, in the russian plains. Then the war had to be a total war including extermination of european jewry. With Lukacs' book you really have the impression to get into Hitler's head. Far from the usual portrait dressed in academic books, describing Hitler as evil, deprived of all negative biases concerning Hitler, Lukacs dress a portrait which seems much more accurate than usual ones.",
                    "Not as weighty as some of his larger books on World War II (The Last European War, the Duel) but Lukacs is, as ever, one of the most astute historians of our time and his examination of the historiography of Hitler is a fascinating, insightful, interesting read. Highly recommended.",

Luckacs, een Amerikaans Hongaars historicus die zelf de holocaust in Europa overleefde, overloopt verschillende hypotheses over Hitler en onderwerpt ze aan een scherp historisch oordeel. Ik was het niet met alles eens wat Luckacs zei maar was ten zeerste onder de indruk van zijn enorme eruditie. De man zou tegen het eind van zijn leven (gestorven mei, 2019) zo'n 18.000 boeken verzameld hebben in zijn persoonlijke bibliotheek en dat merk je als je dit boek doorleest."

In short, when human rights are grossly abused and politics turned to fascist demagoguery, can art and artists be innocent?, These questions and their implications are explored in Michael Kater's broad survey of musicians and the music they composed and performed during the Third Reich. Great and small--from Valentin Grimm, a struggling clarinetist, to Richard Strauss, renowned composer--are examined by Kater, sometimes in intimate detail, and the lives and decisions of Nazi Germany's professional musicians are laid out before the reader., Kater tackles the issue of whether the Nazi regime, because it held music in crassly utilitarian regard, acted on musicians in such a way as to consolidate or atomize the profession. Kater's examination of the value of music for the regime and the degree to which the regime attained a positive propaganda and palliative effect through the manner in which it manipulated its musicians, and by extension, German music, is of importance for understanding culture in totalitarian systems., This work, with its emphasis on the social and political nature of music and the political attitude of musicians during the Nazi regime, will be the first of its kind. It will be of interest to scholars and general readers eager to understand Nazi Germany, to music lovers, and to anyone interested in the interchange of music and politics, culture and ideology."

                    "This is an extremely dry and granular accounting of Nazis and the composers and performers they loved and hated. I can't imagine anyone not specifically interested in this topic would find it an engrossing read. Kater discusses some of the big names (Richard Strauss, Herbert von Karajan, Otto Klemperer, Arnold Schoenberg, Wilhelm Furtwängler, Paul Hindemith) at some depth, but also reams of the lesser-knowns. The text is only 239 pages but feels much longer.Kater was given unrestricted access to Strauss's papers by his family, and is able to provide a reassessment:...it can be shown that Strauss's engagement with the Nazi regime, deplorable as it was, was far less committed and durable, and far less motivated by personal, egocentric concerns, than has hitherto been held. Besides Hindemith, whom Strauss respected despite his dislike of the Weimar modernists, he also tried to help other victims of the regime, although not with the public fanfare of a Furtwängler. In addition, there is now a large body of evidence to prove that Strauss and his family were punished by the regime to a degree of viciousness never thought possible in the case of a supposed Third Reich collaborator.(*) Hence, it is fair to conclude that, just as Furtwängler's portrait in the Third Reich has, for decades now, been far too flatteringly drawn, that of Strauss has been painted much less charitably, and redressing this imbalance is in order.These are fascinating stories of both collaboration and resistance, occasionally in the same individual. The famed conductor Furtwängler was Hitler and Göring's favorite, yet he also intervened on behalf of some of the Jewish players in his orchestras. (He could do so because of his lofty position, he wasn't likely to suffer disastrous consequences.) Kater details some of the attempts of those who had been cozy with the Nazis to deny it when the Americans came to interview them in the postwar denazification process. Herbert von Karajan, for instance, had joined the Nazi Party twice, but denied it. The soprano Elisabeth Schwarzkopf had also joined the Party young, like Karajan, for opportunistic career reasons, and repeatedly denied it until confronted with the evidence. She declined to speak to Kater for the book, although he pursued her for two years.(*) Strauss's son Franz, although a fervent Nazi, was actually married to a Jew, and by 1945, 26 members of her family had been murdered in Nazi camps or otherwise. Richard Strauss himself drove to the gates of the Theresienstadt death camp in his car in an attempt to help them, but was turned away. In 1938, Nazi officials came to the town of Garmisch where Franz Strauss and his Jewish wife Alice lived, to arrest her, she was away, but they took the young Strauss sons (grandsons of Richard) to the town square in tears, and forced them to spit on the Jews who had been assembled there.",
                    "This compelling book examines a wide variety of musicians - from struggling performers to world-renowned composers - and how they and their music interacted with the Third Reich. Kater looks at the degrees to which these musicians complied, collaborated, or resisted. He also looks at the value Hitler and his regime placed on music, the ways they manipulated it to serve their political and social ends, and the degree of success they had in these endeavors. Although I feel like Kater could have tightened up the organization of his material, I really enjoyed his writing. His prose was clear and flowed well. I also like the fact that, when referring to Nazis and their atrocities, he almost entirely eschewed the kind of sanitized, objective prose typical of scholarly writing. Kater directly and bluntly described Hans Frank, governor of occupied Poland, as that butcher of Poles and Jews. He also described a musician who did not survive as having been sent to Auschwitz to be murdered, rather than saying that he died in the camp. The picture Kater paints is often complicated, without a lot of clear heroes or villains among the musicians profiled. Nonetheless it was still chilling in many ways, and there was a sense in which it all read a little like the non-fiction equivalent of a horror novel. ",
                    "Very good overview of music and musicians in Nazi Germany. Also written in an engaging style which is refreshing for an academic book.",
                    "Great book. Essentially short biographies throughout each chapter. Functionalist approach. No serious discussion of their music except for one or two minor instances. Read for the haphazard approach and application of NSDAP policy and not for a discussion of music theory. ",
                    "Excellent source of information, but the organizational structure tended to interrupt any narrative. "

And he shows how these squads were utilized as the Nazis made two separate plans for dealing with the civilian populations they wanted to destroy. Drawing on Nuremberg Tribunal documents largely ignored until now, and on newly available material from eyewitnesses and survivors, Richard Rhodes has given us a book that is essential reading on the Holocaust the World War II."

                    "They are ripping children out of the arms of their mothers down at the Mexican border, putting them in cages with little warm clothing. Where is the outrage? I know it is there because it has to be, but is it enough? Isn’t this illegal? What happened to humanity? To America?Hitler tested the people of Germany by first shooting Jews on the streets, letting them fall dead into trenches. Where was the outrage? There was none. Some cheered. He continued. Later he took them away, put them in camps and let them starve, with little food or clothing. And as they weaken, and maybe even before, he gassed them.Who are these people who do such things, and who are the men who follow? They are the ones who want a fight, who have been physicall abused by one of their parents, they are the men who have been trained to kill. These are the men that Hitler wanted in his military and in his government. It picked the violent ones, and the ones he could train. They are the loyal ones, but even they were afraid of him, as they should be, for he could turn on anyone one them at any given moment, because unlike they, he had no loyalties.Is this the country we want? Am I wrong to compare? Some yes, but then there are Jews, those who have studied history, who say that I am not. They are the ones who can see into the future, so to speak.Update: I spoke too soon about the lack of interest in helping the children at the border, and while Trump had his mind changed as to taking children away from their parents, they have not been returned to them. He now keeps devising other ways to deal with the border, with the Hispanics. In the beginning, in Germany, the Jews were killed on the streets. They made Russian prisoners of war dig long trenches, and then they grabbed the children out of their parent’s arms and lined them up with the women and men. I know, I am repeating myself here, just as history repeats itself. Hitler’s SS men sometimes had nervous breakdowns due to having killed and watched and the killings of the women and children. Listening to the wailing, seeing death, and knowing that some had been buried alive, and some had crawled out of their grave but had died a few feet away. A few escaped in the night and lived to tell. So many people had been buried in the trenches that poisonous gases formed and the drinking water was being polluted. There had to be a better way, even a way to prevent the mental breakdowns of the SS men.How could people kill others so easily? First, it took demonizing the Jews, calling them “animals’ just as Trump has called the Hispanics “animals,” “rapists” and “criminals.” It is that easy. Make them the enemy. Next, train your men well, and try to get men who have been abused as children, just as I have said, for they are the easiest to train, to make violent. Then the other men would just have to follow orders or else. Those who just did as told were often the ones who had nervous breakdowns. So they devised a way to gas the Jewish people, a way that would distance Hitler’s men from the killings. The Jews would go quietly into a truck where gas was then released, the same with the death camps. I thought of the drones that we are producing now, the buttons that men have to push, the not seeing. And Hitler then had the bodies burned instead of polluting the land.“’People must be motivated to kill others, or else they would not do so.’ In fact, motivation is not sufficient by itself to produce serious violence, people must also have undergone prior violent experiences: they must have learned to be violent and must have come to identify themselves as violent. Otherwise their intense hatreds will emerge as ugly but nonviolent behaviors.”Himmler, the head of the SS had said, “For him (Hitler) I could do anything. Believe me, if Hitler were to say I should shoot my mother, I would do it and be proud of his confidence.”Yet, to be in Hitler’s presence, and to hear unfavorable comments by Hitler towards him, caused even Himmler to become so upset as to produce violent reactions, which took the form of severe stomach pains. To watch people be murdered upset him as well, and I think he suffered a breakdown as well. He chose not to watch, to just give orders. After all, like Hitler, he wanted to make Germany great. “About ninety children packed together into two small rooms in filthy state. Their whimpering could be heard in the vicinity of the house. Some of the children, mainly infants, were completely exhausted and almost lifeless.” Nobody came for them.",

I will write about my characters reaction to those horrors, and their attempts to get Churchill and FDR to do something to save the Jews, which of course they never did.",
                    "This was a very good book on the atrocities committed by the SS-Einsatzgruppen. These were 'Task Force' groups that operated joint and independently of the Wermarcht Army. They deployed into Eastern Europe as a uniformed paramilitary force conducting cleansing operations. Most people are educated on the German Regular Army, the SS-Waffen, and the SS-run concentraion camps (Konzentrationslager) during the Holocaust. Yet most are not educated on the death-squad tactics of the SS-Einsatzgruppen. The author details the formation, the structural organization of the units, and murderous killings committed in their geographic areas of responsibility:Group A - Latvia, Lithuania, Estonia Group B - BelarusGroup C - northern and central UkraineGroup D - southern Ukraine, Crimea, Caucasus Group E - CroatiaThis was well-written and powerful. I never knew of these units until now and they definitely had a deep impact in the atrocities of the Holocaust. I would recommend it. Thanks!",
                    "Interesting book on the Einsatzgruppen, The SS special task force developed by Heinrich Himmler in Nazi Germany. This was the blueprint to the Holocaust. The Einsatzgruppen invaded with the German army parts of eastern Poland and Russia, for the first phase of Hitler's Final Solution. They murdered more than 1.5 million men, women, and children between 1941-1943. These death squads dug pits and executed them.",
                    "This book is definitely not for the faint of heart! Little has been written about the Einsatzgruppen, the Nazis' mobile killing squads, in large part because their story is so gruesome. One passage that stood out particularly in my mind was a story about how a bunch of Jews, including women and children, were pushed into a pit and then slaked lime was poured over them. Slaked lime is a powerful corrosive and these people essentially dissolved while fully alive. Their sufferings were so awful that not even the Einsatzgruppen tried that again.This is a very well-researched and -written book, thorough but fairly short, and the author has some interesting theories about how ordinary men were driven to kill unarmed civilians over and over. I would recommend, but with the caveat that it's not for the squeamish.",
                    "In the spring of 1941, a police academy in Pretzch, a town on the Elbe river about fifty miles southwest of Berlin, became the site of a sinister assembly. Several thousand men from the ranks of the SS – the Nazi party's defense echelon, a police and security service that answered directly to Hitler and wasn't confined to the German law – were ordered to report to Pretzch for training and assignment. They weren't told what the assignment would be, but their commonalities gave a clue: many of them had served in SS detachments in Poland when Germany occupied it in 1939, and preference was given to those who spoke Russian. Soon the men learned that they would be assigned to an Einsatzgruppe – a task force. Einsatz units had followed the German army into Austria, Czechoslovakia, and Poland. They secured occupied territories in advance of civilian administrators, confiscated weapons, gathered incriminating documents, and arrested people the SS considered politically unreliable. They also brutally and systematically murdered the occupied country's political, educational, religious and intellectual leadership. Since Germany had signed a non-agression pact with the Soviet Union in August 1939, the candidates in Pretzch believed they would be assigned to follow the Wermacht into England, some of them had previously trained to just that end.When the Nazi forces attacked Poland on September 1, 1939, five Einsatzgruppen that Heydrich, a tall, horse-faced, sneering former naval officer whom even his own subordinates called the blonde beast, had organized followed behind, each group subdivided into four Einsaztkommandos of 100 to 150 men. These advance cadres were reinforced with Order Police battallions, Totenkopf concentration-camp guard regiments and Waffen-SS, producing a combined SS force approaching twenty thousand men. Bruno Streckenbach, the commander of one of the Polish Einsatzgruppen, would become the head of the SS personnel responsible for recruiting the new Einsatzgruppen forming in Pretzch in 1941.Three weeks after invading Poland, the Wehrmacht washed its hands of further responsibility for the 714 mass executions, leaving the field to the specialists of the SS. Heydrich met with Quartermaster General Eduard Wagner to agree on an SS cleanup once and for all of Jews, intelligentsia, clergy, nobolity. Heydrich then wrote the Einsatzgruppen commanders specifically concerning the Jewish question in the occupied territory, distinguishing between the ultimate aim (which would take some time) and interim measures. The interim measures were the clearing of Western Poland from Jews and the concentrating of the Jews in ghettos in the remainder of the country. Although Heydrich's letter did not specify what the ultimate aim was, Rhodes reveals that it embodied the basic conception of the order concerning the physical extermination of Jews of the occupied territories. Basically, Heyndrich was assigning – at this early point in time – to Einsatzgruppen the transitional task of bringing the Jewish population of Poland under SS control.In October, the SS brutality descended to unadorned slaughter when Himmler extended executions to the mentally and physically disabled. This so-called euthanasia program was just beginning in Germany, to be directed initially against children, but the first SS killings preceded any euthanasia murders: the SS's victims were German, removed from hospitals in the Prussian province of Pomerania and transported by train across the border to the occupied Poland. While the euthanasia program in Germany had to proceed by stealth, occupied terriory was no-man's-land, beyond law and public scrutiny. Just as it would be easier to murder Jews in the subjugated lands east of Germany, so it was easier to kill the disabled there, including German citizens.A large SS regiment had resided in the Free City of Danzig before the war, commanded by SS Sturmbannführer Kurt Eimann. Late in October 1939, the Pomeranian disabled were shipped into Poland. The Eimann Batallion met the train at the station. In the nearby forest, Polish political prisoners labored to dig killing pits to serve as mass graves. Trucks delivered the disabled to the forest. The first victim was a woman about fifthy years old, Eimann personally dispatched her with a Genickschluss, a shot in the neck from behind at the point where the spinal cord enters the skull...Richard Rhodes’ book is almost unrelievedly grim, shocking, and brimming with hideous details. Yet, the author gives full weight to the largely ignored by concetration-camp studies role the Einsatzgruppen played in the murder of approximately 1.5 million innocent civilians – mainly Soviet Jews – early in WWII. To prove his case, Rhodes – a Pulitzer Prize winning author – draws upon postwar memoirs, Nuremberg Trial interrogations, and the Nazi's fanaticism for statistic detail to create a very graphic account of the appaling genocidal murder on the Eastern front beginning with Operation Barbarossa in July 1941. By January 1942, when the Wansee Conference implicitly authorized the death camps, more than a million Jews already crowded the killing pits, some of them later torched to destroy evidence of the massacres. Rhodes masterfully organizes the book in such a fashion as to show the escalation of violence and mass murder that the troops quickly embraced in the early months of the war and that ultimately culminated in Auschwitz and the rest of KL. What distinguishes his book is exactly that focus on the initial phase of mass murder, on the brutal tasks carried out by the four SS Einsatzgruppen on the orders of SS leaders Himmler and Heyndrich before the death camps became the main killing apparatus. A painful, tough but very important and well-researched history. Five stars.",
                    "WARNING! This book is very graphic and disturbing. It is truly a horror story of a different sort. After reading this book, I once told someone, If a movie were made about this book, without being edited for content, it would be very difficult to watch. It is that graphic and horrifying. MASTERS OF DEATH begins innocently enough, drops you right in the middle of the Holocaust, and shows you the true face of evil.",
                    "This is a necessary book, but not a very uplifting read. We walk through the eastern front as the SS-Einsatzgruppen murder innocent people. The descriptions and accounts are horrible. They come from first and second hand accounts of the massacres. People that witnessed and escaped the atrocities.What is missing is the death camps and how they actually came to be. The immediacy of them is described, but there is no talk of the construction or running of them. There aren't accounts of conditions of the camps such as Dachau or Auschwitz where many many people were slaughtered. What this book covers is the early stages of the murders and how the Holocaust came into being. Murder pits and slaughter. Again, not uplifting, but quite necessary."

                    "Anti-Semitic, Nazi housewife falls for young Jewish woman sounds like a dubious plotline from the kind of Holocaust-porn made popular by the commercial success of novels like The Tattooist of Auschwitz, but Fischer’s book’s based on actual events. The love affair between Lilly (Elizabeth) Wust and Felice Schragenheim was brought to light in the 1990s by feminist author Erica Fischer. In early 1940s' Berlin, Lilly was an officer’s wife, as well as four small children, the couple shared anti-Semitic prejudice and Nazi affiliations. Then along came Inge Wolf who introduced Lilly to someone who shattered Lilly’s preconceptions. Inge was part of Berlin’s underground, lesbian community, something Lilly found fascinating. Lilly was charmed and intrigued first by Inge’s circle and then by one woman in particular, Felice. It was only after Lilly and Felice got together that Lilly discovered Felice was Jewish.However, anyone wanting to immerse themselves in an inevitably-tragic love story will be disappointed here, Fischer’s approach to her material’s less straightforward than that. She shifts between narrative reconstructions and accounts drawn from interview transcripts, historical research, letters and diaries. Right from the beginning, when Lilly refuses to accept the way Inge characterises Lilly’s apartment as dominated by Nazi symbols, it’s clear Fischer’s interested in the broader implications of Lilly’s version of the past. What it may or may not demonstrate about the reliability of memory, the difficulty of using oral histories to reach some form of incontestable truth, and the wider issue of Germany’s so-called coming-to-terms with the past (Vergangenheitsbewältigung). Fischer’s as much interrogator as chronicler of Lilly’s recollections, she’s obviously sceptical about the image Lilly’s seeking to project. It’s an intriguing perspective with a great deal of potential but the outcome's disappointing - I couldn’t help wondering what this might have been like penned by a more skilful and intellectually- sophisticated writer like Janet Malcolm. Many of the sections fictionalising Lily and Felice’s relationship tend to alternate between a dry recitation of facts and overblown, almost syrupy prose. Passages detailing the political and historical backdrop to Lily and Felice’s lives are frequently informative but a number are slightly dull or unnecessarily convoluted. Having said all that, I still found this worth reading, as much for the questions it raises as for how it tackles them, as well as for the glimpse it provides of an under-represented chapter of lesbian history.Rating: 2.5",
                    "Although I agree with all the criticisms lobbed at this book by other reviewers below, I nonetheless give it 5 stars because it fascinated me, due simply to the heartbreaking, scandalous, and improbable tale underlying it.As others have written, Aimee may be flighty and appear not take the plight of her lover seriously, but I feel it is easy to judge her retrospectively. I don't believe she behaves differently than many people in the throes of a deep infatuation, however, given that she is infatuated with a Jew living underground in Nazi Germany, her foibles seem much more weighty to the reader. The book is heavy on quotes from love letters, which I skimmed as they became repetitive. I agree that the author has a bias against Lilly Wust- as she herself states in the epilogue- and this colors her tone throughout the book. The author is allowed to have a point of view, though, even if she is writing non-fiction. She presents the facts in such a way that I was able to draw my own conclusions about the characters' motivations.All in all, I felt the book lent yet another valuable perspective in the larger body of personal stories of the Holocaust. It was difficult to not to feel Felice's personality shining through. ",
                    "it was amazing.. I came to this book from the movie, and while I started to read it imagining the actresses of the movie as the characters in the book, I ended up with having the real pictures of Aimée and Jaguar in my head while reading (there are heartbreakingly good photos of them at the end of the book). at times it was tough, cause even though I knew how this tragic story was gonna end, I was still hoping, together with Aimée. the most tragic thing about this book though is that Jaguar's fate was the fate of so fucking many people - excuse the swearing. their letters and diary entries often made me smile inside, cause they are such good prose. and their poetry is fab as well. oh and the book also taught me A LOT about Nazi Germany and concentration camps, even though I thought I knew quite something already. also to hear about the war from the perspective of a Nazi woman was interesting.. I still feel so sorry for Aimée and I know that this should not have happened. read this book, guys, it will make you a better person.",
                    "As with any WWII story involving a Jewish person living in Germany, it's bound to be sad. I felt connected to the characters, but the author's style really made this a tough read. The story was set up like a documentary, only in book form. There would be bits of prose, excerpts of diaries and letters and then straight dialogues from interviews. These elements were not synthesized in a way that made reading it enjoyable. This is a story of a young German mother who meets a Jewish woman and begins to house her. They fall in love rather quickly, since Elisabeth (or Lilly, or Aimée) was unhappy in her marriage to a Nazi soldier. Felice (or Jaguar), the illegal Jew, lives happily with her lover until, of course, she is captured by the Gestapo. The struggles that follow, and Lilly's brave attempts to help Felice make up the bulk of the story. Reading about the lives of Jews in Nazi-era Berlin was of course depressing, but the most chilling part of this read came at the very end, where the author describes the living conditions of a hopeless, possibly deranged Lilly in her old age. Perhaps a WWII enthusiast would better enjoy this book, but again the writing style just didn't do it for me. ",
                    "If you intend to read a book about what Nazizm did to people, make it this one. On the one hand, it's very detailed, but not intended to shock, rather respectful and informative. On the other, it is a study a study of maddening love that Aimée throws herself into the more ardently, the more difficult the circumstances, until the loss of a loved one leaves her with no resources to pick up the pieces and her life becomes little more than vegetation.",
                    "I would rather experience great unhappiness and be destroyed by it than live in moderate happiness to a moderate end.  I am deeply unnerved by this book and sadly disappointed. First, I absolutely adored this story, and I hate myself for hyping it up so much after watching the movie. After hunting down the English edition for so long (sadly my Deutsch is, admittedly, too scheiße to read the original German, despite my many years of study), I suppose I simply had too many great expectations. Fundamentally, this is an extremely significant story that simply had to be told. I thank Fischer for this, but I would've strongly suggested she approached the writing of Aimée and Jaguar a lot differently. The tragic love story of two women in Nazi Germany should not, in my opinion, read like a fact book. Consequently, I felt little-to-no empathy towards the main characters--our protagonists Lilly and Felice--for most of the story, despite this improving in the latter half of the book. I felt the most for Felice and however little fault this is of the author, I left this book wanted to know more about her. Otherwise, this book read very much like a documentary, it compiles transcripts from various characters while stringing together letters, excerpts and a on top of it all: a narrative. It was far too muddled and it stifled the emotions I expected to feel during this novel. Although this may very well be the harsh consequences of the translation, it nevertheless does not change the format. I don't want to blast this book apart, because I really do find the story a very fascinating one and it is collected well. I'm sure most of the book is based upon fragments of fact and Wurst's recollection, so in this instance Fischer does quite well to piece everything together. I'm also a huge fan of luscious lesbian Berlin and the lives of lesbians throughout history, therefore I found this a very fascinating read in terms of how people handled it back then and how the protagonists themselves reacted to having such feelings. On a lighter note, it did fill me with happiness to see the way the family and relatives within the book reacted towards Lilly and Felice's relationship. It was a heart-warming thing to read about, especially given the time period. I suppose what I'm most unnerved about is the author's treatment of Elisabeth (Lilly) Wurst. I'm not so much upset, more confused, simply by the epilogue. I understand Wurst may not have been wholly truthful in her recollections (after all, some things are quite hard to admit, we've all made mistakes) but this was no reason to react so harshly. It seemed very strange and peculiar, as if she were saying Lilly deserved no sympathy due to her heritage being that of strict German and not Jewish. It just read wrongly. Overall, I will pocket this book for years to come. It is a significant story I will keep with me for a long time. Meanwhile, however, I will delight in the movie more times than I ever will the book. "

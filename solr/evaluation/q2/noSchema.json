                    "Outcast due to their ability to manipulate time, shunned by the mortal and immortal worlds alike, a Travellerâ€™s life is anything but easy.,Peter Faa is a member of the Watch tracking down a murderer, and unfortunately, all clues seem to point toward his own estranged family of Travellers. Any of his cousins could be guilty, but which one? Theyâ€™re all experts in the art of stealing time...,After surviving a lightning strike, Kiya Mortenson is determined to get just one thing in her life right. And if that means taking a job as nanny to five pugs on a campsite in the Oregon wilderness, then so be it. It doesnâ€™t hurt that the job comes with some spectacular male eye candy, including her new bossâ€™s gorgeous grandson. If only she didnâ€™t keep having this strange sense of deja vu...,When Peter discovers his own family is stealing time from Kiya, all bets are off. While she may drive him crazy at times, itâ€™s clear that itâ€™s not just lightning thatâ€™s creating some serious sparks between them. And heâ€™s not going to let secrets, lies, or a devious murderer keep Kiya from where she belongs: at his side."

                    "Kiya Mortenson has run into a string of bad luck. She was struck by lightning. Right after she checks out of the clinic with a fresh bill of health, her car decides to stop working on a very dangerous road. Luckily she is saved by a hunky looking man who takes her into town, and pays for her car to be towed. As it turns out, she’s going to need some cash to fix her car. Hunky guy who saved her mentioned his grandmother might hire a helping hand, so she heads off to their RVs. Meanwhile Peter Faa has also entered the town. With Peter’s (kind of) sidekick, a ghost in the shape of a glowing ball, they are determined to track down the killer of a recent string of deaths. Peter is a part of the Watch, a paranormal police order. He has with him DNA evidence that the killer is a member of his family.I’m not new to MacAlister’s work. I greatly enjoyed her Aisling Grey series. So when this one popped up I was very excited to get my hands on it. MacAlister’s novels, or what I’ve read of them, are fast paced romantic comedies with a paranormal twist. Time Thief introduces a new race of people called Travellers. Travellers, well they travel. They live a gypsy kind of life style, moving around from place to place. They can steal time, but have to pay for it or karma will literally bite them. Kiya ends up working for grandmother Faa, caring for her pugs. Because she isn’t a part of the family they set her up in a tent away from the RVs, and before long she runs into Peter Faa who is poking around in the woods. The first meeting between them doesn’t go well, but it isn’t long until Peter is hurt, and runs into Kiya’s tent. It doesn’t take long for Kiya to decide she is going to help him. Together they sort of put two-and-two together until they figure out who the murder is.There is a ton of silliness in these pages, but it might be too silly for my taste. I’m so glad when the heroine isn’t a cop, P.I., detective, or working for some unknown kind of investigative company. Kiya starts out as just a girl down on her luck. She comes off as a little too dense for my taste. On top of that, first impressions mean a lot, and Peter Faa is kind of a jerk. In fact most of the people in the Faa family are jerks. While these two characters make a good match for one another, it bothered me when they didn’t see clues that are right in front of them. Peter is supposed to be a part of the other world Watch, but he’s too involved with watching Kiya to notice when something is buggy is going down.Time Thief’s pacing was well done, but the silliness of it all was a little too much for my taste. The characters seemed a little too dense and random for my taste. Peter and Kiya decide they love each other awfully fast, so fast even Peter’s ghostly friend says something about it. The magic system was very neat and pretty different, and I enjoyed that Kiya wasn’t a stereotypical paranormal heroine.- Beth",
                    "Oh dear God, Katie, this book was kind of a mess! I understand what happened though, with her husband and everything... I'm so sad to give her books anything below a 4 star rating, but I just have to this time. There were several plot errors, like our heroine knowing stuff before she was told. (Like who the last murdered person was.) I spotted a few grammar mistakes/typos and this usually doesn't happen with Katie's books. Or the mistakes aren't that obvious at least.I feel obliged to tell everyone that I'm a big fan of Katie's work and that I absolutely love every single one of her books and series that I have read, but I'm kind of reluctant to continue reading this one. The characters's banter was humorous as always, if even a little unrealistic. I thought Kiya was often a bit too unrealistically portrayed, maybe her witty replies were even a little bit over the top to the point that I even felt a little annoyed when she opened her mouth. I felt like there was no chemistry at all between the two main characters and that's just really a pity. I couldn't get into their relationship, but I know that if I could have that Peter would easily have been one of my favourite heroes. Peter's everything you could wish for in a potential love interest. He's kind, caring, not to mention incredibly hot and he has the most beautiful eyes Kiya has ever seen. (He's also kind of the underdog and I love me some underdogs.) But the book just didn't live up to my expectations of Katie MacAlister, this was below average and not even the witty banter and humour in it could save the book. Katie could have added a lot more background to her characters (especially Kiya and Peter) to make their actions more believable. They fell in love instantly and are ready to get married only days after they met each other, which isn't at all how someone in their thirties acts. (That's what I meant earlier with the unrealistic nature of the story.) The world of the Travellers is rather interesting though, so maybe I will consider reading the next book after all. (I'm actually really curious what's going to happen with Gregory!) I don't know yet, I just feel like giving Katie a big hug, because you can just deduce from her manner of writing that she was rather unfocused and probably in a lot of pain when she wrote this book. ",
                    "My review can also be found on my blog Collections.3.5 starsTime Thief centered around a supernatural group known as Travellers. Travellers can steal time from others and can actually go back in time with however many seconds, minutes, or days they've taken. Stealing time comes at a price, though, and the victims must be given payment in the form of silver, otherwise the Traveller will suffer the consequences. Taking too much time can also lead to death for either victim or Traveller. Both reasons seem to have kept Travellers in check for centuries.The whole Traveller and time stealing thing was basically simple and easy to understand. Only once you got all the information. And in this book, it was spread throughout the story, which may be why I got a little lost at times. I remember when I was a third into the book there was a conversation between the main characters where one was explaining the time stuff to the other, and while that character was getting it, I was left feeling a bit confused. It didn't affect my enjoyment of the book entirely. But for some reason I still think there was something I missed. I can't quite put my finger on what it was though.Other than my slight confusion at times, the book was pretty fun! What made it that way were the main characters Kiya and Peter. Kiya was bubbly and quirky. She had a tendency to ramble and had a hard time keeping her mouth shut. She wasn't a mean-spirited person at all, but she was also not the type to back down from a fight. When other characters in the book managed to make her angry, I kind of just wanted to pat her head and say, There, there. Peter was more of a serious, uptight person. Meeting Kiya threw him off though, and he gained a sense of humor and seemed more talkative than how I assumed he would be under normal circumstances. I did find some of the romantic things he thought and said to Kiya (and vice versa) cheesy, but I realized it suited their relationship, especially considering their personalities.The other Travellers focused on in this book were the Faa family. They were being investigated by Peter (he's part of the Watch, basically the supernatural police) for murders that have occurred in the area. I think the Faas were always suppose to come off as distant and suspicious and irritating. I can't say I ever liked them, expect one of them who I won't name for possible spoilers. I didn't even like the grandmother. I felt she just stayed in the background while the men in her family did whatever they wanted, and she was too cold and concerned with blood purity. Sad thing was Peter is her grandson. He didn't grow up with them, so it was easy for all of them not to care, but I still felt bad for him. I almost wished things had gone a slightly different route by the end.Time Thief might not have ended well for everyone, however, it was the ending that Kiya and Peter deserved. Overall, the entire book kept me entertained and laughing here and there. It was easy to get sucked into the story. There's a book two planned that will be focusing on a character introduced in this book, and I can't help but to wonder what will happen next.",
                    "Time Thief, Traveller #1, by Katie MacAlisterGrade:D“Unhand me, you deranged, if lovely, female!”Kiya Mortenson is not having a good day after being struck by lightning, for the second time, having her car breakdown in the middle of Oregon and losing the job she was covering for a friend. After meeting a friendly stranger, Kiya sets out to try to find work taking care of five rowdy pugs for an elderly Traveller woman. The Travellers are not very happy to have Kiya around but she needs the job to fix her car and get back to her life. The more time Kiya spends with the Travellers the more she learns about the supernatural world and her own past.Peter Faa is a Traveller who was never accepted by his family and has spent his life as an outsider. Peter has devoted his life to being a member of The Watch, the supernatural cops, who are now investigating the Faa family for murder. Peter never expected to find an outsider living with his family and Kiya soon snags all of his attention. Peter knows someone in his family has committed murder but it will take Kiya’s help to discover the actual killer.I am so disappointed in this book for so many reasons. I liked the beginning which is told by Kiya in first person but then the book switches to Peter’s point of view in second person. What???I’ve never come across a book told like this and found it very distracting, confusing and annoying. This continues through the rest of the book and almost made me DNF the whole thing.Kiya is one of the most annoying characters that I have ever read. She is flighty, ditzy and comes off as an idiot. She spends most of her time talking about her ego, id and superego or saying very inappropriate things that are supposed to come off as witty. I like my heroines to be strong, smart and sassy and Kiya was none of those things and just comes off as very immature thirty-two year old. Peter for some reason finds her adorable but spends his entire time yelling at her about bewitching him or how she is not smart. The two of them together drove me crazy.As the book goes on and on it becomes even worse and again I have no idea why I kept reading. About halfway through we get one of the most awkward and unsexy sex scenes I’ve ever read. After this Kiya and Peter like to make uncomfortably gross jokes about his ‘beefy cock’.For example: “Suddenly, he was there, beefy-filled condom and all, thrusting inside me in a manner that left me as the incoherent one.” I never want to read about a beefy-filled condom especially in a romance novel. Besides the bad sex these two are trying to solve a murder that is already solved but takes forever to wrap up.Time Thief was a big fail in my opinion and I will not being reading anymore of this series. ",
                    "How to review this book??? I will just have to be as honest as possible without giving away anything. Sorry guys but I just don't DO spoilers...We have a brand new novel from one of the most humorous writers today! Kiya is a unique woman. She starts out the book, with a broken down heap of a car sitting in a doctors office while waiting for her appointment because she has been struck by lightening AGAIN! Yep lightning DOES strike the same spot twice!This book is a laugh a minute! I read this book long into the night, and woke my husband from a sound sleep when my laughing got out of control. Talk about a mess a minute! Peter and Kiya are just too much fun!I have been a fan of Katie MacAlister's books for a while now, and this one is right up there with her other books. We still have the same type creatures as we find in all her other books. And the Watch are alive and well in this book.I HIGHLY recommend this book to anyone who wishes a good laugh and who loves a bit of romance thrown in. And mystery, boy do we have a mystery! And as usual Katie MacAlister uses her humor and all sorts of twists and turns to keep us off our feet for the entire novel.When I turned to the last page in my Kindle I was nearly crying because I wanted MORE!!!! Luckily I know her novella is due out in August with the next book in the series due out shortly thereafter! Thank God for that!Well what are you waiting for? Go grab your own copy!!!!"

                    "Just based on the title I did not think I was going to like this book very much, but I actually really enjoyed it and it's message. Pirates and Princesses is a fiction book about Ivy and Fletch. They have been friends their whole lives, in fact their mother's were pregnant at the same time and they were born a day apart. They went through all the stages together from learning to sit up to running. They did everything together. It wasn't until kindergarten that they had to choose to play with the boys or the girls. They enjoyed being Pirate and Princess but they valued their friendship more and they preferred playing together. They taught the kids other games that they could play like leaping lizards and twisty cakes. These games were not exclusive to one gender or the other and anyone could play on any team.. they were inclusive and the only thing that mattered was that everyone was having fun. This book is interesting for elementary age kids and is very relatable . I love that the characters are believable and the illustrations do a good job of corresponding with the text and depicting the characters and settings accurately. We can learn a lot about friendships and being open minded from reading this book. This story shows us that kids are kids and that boys and girls should play together. It also shows that kids should be able to choose what team they want to play on or what games they want to play. The only thing that I did not like about this books was that the characters did not represent a variety of cultural groups.",
                    "Liked the overall message, but didn't like stereotypes",
                    "It's inevitable with television and retail marketing that kids are going to associate certain play items with being a boy and others with being a girl. Ever notice sections of Toys R Us that are entirely pink? While it's impossible to avoid such displays, I try to be as gender neutral as possible when it comes to the toys my children (a girl and a boy) play with, the clothes they wear, the colors they like, etc.That's basically the gist of Pirates and Princesses. Ivy and Fletch have known each other since birth. Their moms are best friends, and soon they are too. All is well until they get to kindergarten and first experience...recess!The girls want Ivy to play princesses, and the boys want Fletch to play Pirates. I won't say much more other than the book is sweet, hysterically funny in it's narration, and has a great message about being who you want to be regardless of gender stereotypes. And so, when I was done reading the story to my daughter, I tucked her in tight, all snuggled in her football pjs that she picked out when she was four (and she's six now and still wears them). And I smiled to myself as I thought of my almost three-year-old asleep on his Disney princess pillow case. Love whatever you want.",
                    "This book makes it okay for boys and girls to be friends and play the same games, without being boyfriend and girlfriend. It would be great to use if there is gender bullying on the playground because it encourages games that aren't gender based, like princess castle or pirate ship. Cooties definitely are not a problem in this book, and that is why I like it. You could read this book just with words OR pictures only! It is not a book I will exactly remember, but it does have a good message, like most children's books do. ",
                    "My kids really liked this...esp. my 6 yo daughter who loves both pirates and princesses. Ivy and Fletch have been friends forever, but once they go to school they begin to make other friends and for a time will only play with children of the same gender...the boys play pirates and the girls play princesses. But Ivy and Fletch shake things up on the playground and recess is about to become a lot more fun!",
                    "Pirates and Princesses is about a little boy Fletch and a little girl Ivy who have been the best of friends since birth. Then comes kindergarten where the boys play with only boys and the girls play with only girls. The Pirate team and the Princess Team. A really cute story about how one boy and girl teach all of the others how to play with each other on the playground. A wonderful teaching tool for peer pressure, friendship and play."

I was a little surprised to find out that most people find graphic novels disjointed because of all the hands that go into the pot in order to expedite issues for monthly production. If anything, all the series/graphic novels I have read seem to NEED that collaboration between writer and artist to translate their vision onto paper and I feel have been successful at it. It’s a marriage of the two. I also enjoyed seeing how they have people play out the character scenes and pose as the panel is to going to be drawn. I hadn’t ever really thought about how these scenes get on paper, but I thought it was a neat process. Recap of this volume to remind myself. ****Possible spoilers ahead****:--We see a second possible archnemesis? This one steps out of the river swathed in an electric field, causing a blackout throughout the whole city. He is looking for Mitch to pass on information on how they got their powers, so it is unknown whether he’s a good or bad guy. His powers however are able to neutralize Mitch’s powers, so it is yet to be seen what will come of this story.--The issue of immigration is mentioned but never concluded. Can I just say that I’m a little tired of everytime immigration is brought up it is immediately blamed on Mexicans. They are not the only people who are immigrants. People from all over Europe, Asia, Africa, South America, to name a few, immigrate to the U.S. It is not just Mexico. That joke gets a little old and I found it insulting how Mexico is the first place people point a finger to.--We see a bit more of a glimpse into what happened on 9/11. I did question though how Mitch knew the second tower would get hit. He was already using his powers to call on some fighter jets to assist him in stopping the second plane from hitting the second tower, but these are just glimpses we see into the past without much explanation. This is already the sixth volume so I’m wondering when Vaughan is going to start tying up ends.Overall, a good issue.",
                    "Something wicked comes in this way..",
                    "Grown man topics is something you gotta deal with, No matter how many super powers you love it ain’t gonna equal up to this real shit....Let me just start by saying this is the best “Graphic Novel” I have ever read. I wouldn’t even call this a comic. I know that there is a difference between a comic and a graphic novel but I’ve also seen the terms use interchangeably but this piece of work is too great to be called anything else. I read “Y The Last Man” so I was a fan of Brian K Vaughn (Although Under The Dome is terrible). Ex Machina exceeded my expectations. I love reading about super powers and the fight between good and evil and all that good shit but I also love seeing real issues discussed. Ex Machina does this perfectly. The parallel NYC was amazing and Mitchell Hundred is one of the most interesting characters I’ve seen.Vol 6 moved a little slower. It had the story of a power outage but this volume also helped to build up the backstory. I don’t want to give anything away so I’ll just say that I highly recommend Ex MachinaFYI: I’ll leave a review for all ten volumes but only change the last paragraph because the first three paragraphs were so powerful that they are relevant to all ten volumes.. LOL",
                    "Another great volume in the Ex Machina series. Finally, Mitchell's mom shows up again! We learn a little bit more about Mitchell's bodyguard, Bradbury. And a mysterious guy appears (from the future? from the past? from an alternate dimension??), which mysteriously causes a complete north east power outage. What is the connection between Mystery Guy and Mitchell's powers? It is hinted at, but we don't learn much, and it's never 100% clear if Mystery Guy can be trusted.",
                    "Pretty intriguing, but this new volume still doesn't stand up to some of the earlier ones. With the introduction of a new character from a alternate timeline, things are starting to get MUCH more interesting. However, there are still more questions than answers and I'm hoping these get answered shortly.",
                    "Ex Machina: Power Down takes Mayor Hundred and throws him into the Great Northeast Blackout of 2003 (which I weirdly lived through but have no memory of), doing its usual mix of city politics and superhero antics, both fairly well.I admit, the part I always like most about these comics is The West Wing-style discussion of city emergency policy that take up the opening pages (hence instantly falling for Nolita Cemac, OEM Liaison). It doesn’t get as much play as some of the policy-oriented issues, but I still appreciate it.The ‘superhero’ side of Power Down deals with Hundred losing his abilities to communicate with machines during the blackout, and dealing with a traveler from an alternate version of Earth, where the Cold War still rages and 9/11 never happened. (Incidentally, the discussion Hundred has about how best to memorialize 9/11 is probably the best rumination in the book). Once again, we get a tantalizing glimpse of the nature of Hundred’s powers, only for it to be snatched away too soon.Of particular note is the backmatter to the comic, which contains a ton of interesting behind-the-scene stuff, including information on Vaughan’s collaborative process and the artistic workflow. Definitely worth a read.",
                    "More super heroes mixed with politics. During a city-wide blackout, Hundred faces a dimension traveler who has a warning about Hundred's new powers. I find the volumes that explore Hundred's powers, and where they came from, to be more interesting."

                    "In \"To America,\" Stephen E. Ambrose, one of the country's most influential historians, reflects on his long career as an American historian and explains what an historian's job is all about. He celebrates America's spirit, which has carried us so far. He confronts its failures and struggles. As always in his much acclaimed work, Ambrose brings alive the men and women, famous and not, who have peopled our history and made the United States a model for the world.Taking a few swings at today's political correctness, as well as his own early biases, Ambrose grapples with the country's historic sins of racism, its neglect and ill treatment of Native Americans, and its tragic errors (such as the war in Vietnam, which he ardently opposed on campus, where he was a professor). He reflects on some of the country's early founders who were progressive thinkers while living a contradiction as slaveholders, great men such as Washington and Jefferson. He contemplates the genius of Andrew Jackson's defeat of a vastly superior British force with a ragtag army in the War of 1812. He describes the grueling journey that Lewis and Clark made to open up the country, and the building of the railroad that joined it and produced great riches for a few barons.,Ambrose explains the misunderstood presidency of Ulysses S. Grant, records the country's assumption of world power under the leadership of Theodore Roosevelt, and extols its heroic victory of World War II. He writes about women's rights and civil rights and immigration, founding museums, and nation- building. He contrasts the presidencies of Dwight Eisenhower, John F. Kennedy, Richard Nixon, and Lyndon B. Johnson. Throughout, Ambrose celebratesthe unflappable American spirit.,Most important, Ambrose writes about writing history. \"The last five letters of the word 'history' tell us that it is an account of the past that is about people and what they did, which is what makes it the most fascinating of subjects.\",\"To America\" is an instant classic for all those interested in history, patriotism, and the love of writing."

                    "This book was published in 2002 shortly before Ambrose died. It is an excellent treatise on many of the forty historical book subjects that he covered in his career. Ambrose is what might be called a ‘popular’ historian. And his passion - judging by the number of books - would be military campaigns. D-Day and Band of Brothers are amongst the best of them. These books also led to his museum creation and fundraising for D-Day and many friendships with veterans of all stripes. If you have seen any of his interviews in various documentaries, the seriousness and passion with which he speaks is quite engaging. Interestingly enough I’m more drawn to his other works - those that involve the American landscape. His book on Lewis and Clark called ‘Undaunted Courage’ and his book ‘Crazy Horse and Custer’ are amongst my favorites by any author. These books ooze with images of landscapes and wildness - just beautiful and romantic in an American West way. Ambrose is a bit old school especially regarding his patriotic fervor in defending Eisenhower. As a young author he became Eisenhower’s biographer and got to know him very well. But despite his subjectivity, Ambrose’s heart is in the right place and his sins - if any exist - would be ones of opinion. His books do not avoid unseemly subjects. I do not agree with Ambrose when he says that Nixon was actually one of America’s better presidents - as measured by political accomplishments. Ambrose probably had a clearer eyed view than myself because he clearly did not like the guy, called him a liar repeatedly. Nixon clearly did not like Ambrose calling him “one of those leftist historians”. I haven’t read Ambrose’s biographical trilogy on Nixon only because I have read another biography on Nixon and that is enough for me. I am sure it would be good. Ambrose provides some excellent assessments of the presidencies of Jefferson, Grant and TR. He contends that Jefferson was a great intellect but not a great leader. Grant was one of the great presidents and this was not a popular opinion forty years ago. He was one of the only historians who publicly said so way back then. Ambrose noted that TR’s greatest gifts to America were the conservation movement that he started and that TR foresaw with great clarity America’s need to be a global power. In two short chapters at the end of the book, Ambrose tries to address the racism and misogyny that he witnessed and that were especially prevalent in his times. He spoke of his mother who could have run and won a position in the Wisconsin legislature but his father - a Navy doctor - was against it. 4.5 stars.",
                    "My father gave me this book last summer before my husband and I embarked upon a long cross-country road trip. I did actually begin the book in the car along the way, but didn't finish it until this past week. I have a mixed opinion about the book, complicated even farther by my English teacher reaction to some articles I've since read about Ambrose's writing and alleged plagiarism in some of his books (articles I plan to use in class for those serious discussions with my students about what it actually means to plagiarize). So...let me try to sort it out. I liked the book, initially. I liked the idea of a long and storied historian writing his reflections of a life spent studying the history of his country. I liked that the book was divided into chapters dealing with some of the most controversial issues in our nation's history, and that Ambrose seemed to (like me) find the hidden areas of gray in the diabolically opposing sides to the arguments. I liked that he recognized, as we do in the film CRASH, the novel OF MICE AND MEN, and the philosophical discussions of Socrates's dissidents in PLATO'S REPUBLIC that in this human condition we are all both victim and predator. That no one is immune from bad decisions or incapable of good ones. But...I felt that the book veered away from that organization, becoming a self-indulgent litany of Ambrose's own life and writing. And I didn't like the final chapters where he tried to incorporate his own life into the history he writes. I don't think it was successful. I don't think it worked. So...as I ended the book I found myself tired and frustrated, and ready to put it down. In final retrospect, I have to wonder if Ambrose himself (with the accusation and controversy surrounding his writing) wasn't simply a human reflection of the history he analyzed--not altogether evil, not altogether good. Just human, poor, weak, and capable of miraculous things.",
                    "An amazing book! A personal reflection on American history from a leading US Historian. Goes into showing the American spirit and what made this country great. Lewis and Clarke's expedition, manifest destiny, and the war of 1812 are just some points. Stephen Ambrose seamlessly blends historical fact with his view on how these events forged who we are today as a country, a society, and a free people! Truly a book every American should read!",
                    "For fans of the late historian (Ambrose died in 2002) this book is something of a treat as it tells how he became an historian (he was a pre-med student initially), how he got into the writing game, and the stories behind all the books he had written. Throughout the book there is always a theme of transition and progression, not just in the sense of America as a nation, but in Ambrose as a scholar, writer, man and citizen, as he studies the history of the nation and its peoples, he progresses from what everyone knows about history, to what he was taught about history, to what he learned about history. For example, everyone knows how the west was won, and he was taught by his professors how America stole from the Indians and tried to exterminate them, but he learned that the Americans of the time did nothing more or worse than what the Indians did themselves, though he does find much to criticize about the way in which America was unable to rise above the passions of their age and live up to the ideals we embodied in our own founding documents, a dichotomy which continues to this day.Throughout the book he portrays himself as liberal (though he was stung by Nixon's criticism that he was just another liberal) and left-leaning, but he more bases that on his pacifistic stance during the Vietnam War, and yet as I read of his optimism and patriotism, I thought he perhaps might not be as liberal as he thought. Being adverse to war does not make a person liberal, just sensible, and many of the many of the most ardent opponents to war (as opposed to being anti-war) have been military men, for they are the only ones who truly know, as Sherman pointed out, that war is hell. Though a self-defined dove, he nevertheless consistently praises the abilities and morality of the American fighting man, even during the War in the Pacific, in which America's racism matched that of their Japanese opponents, the extreme enmity in that theater, however, was set aside (at least by the Americans, Japan has yet to admit, much less come to terms with its own aggression and racism) when MacArthur ruled Japan and set the stage for the emergence of a free and democratic Japan. MacArthur's enlightened rule of Japan echoes the command Eisenhower (Ambrose's favorite subjuct and his pick for American of the Century) held in Germany, with him instructing the German press corps that they were to be agents of the truth, not stooges of the government, that they should even criticize him in the press. Like Japan, Germany is the democratic bastion it is today because they were defeated by America, not conquered by the USSR.Ambrose brings an even hand to history, criticizing America's mis-steps, and yet doing so without condemnation. He attributes much of that to his association with former President Eisenhower, who he interviewed weekly (or more) for his multi-volume biographies and other books about WW2. Without that association, he feared, he might have gone the way of other liberals of his time, spiraling into an abyss where America became an evil empire guilty of heinous crimes and responsible for all the ills of the world. It was impossible, he write, to know Eisenhower and not learn to honor and respect the country. In assessing America's unique nature upon the world stage, Ambrose points out three major triumphs for America:*the creation of our democratic republic in the 18th Century*the abolition of slavery and the holding together of our Union in the 19th Century*the crushing of totalitarianism in the 20th CenturyUnfortunately, having no crystal ball, and living only long enough to glimpse the rise of the world's greatest enemy of freedom and human rights, he was unable to predict what America's greatest triumph, or failure, would be in our fourth, and perhaps final, century. And yet, he felt, there might be some hope for the future, because of our accomplishments in bringing freedom and democracy to the oppressed peoples of the world, he wrote, we have made the world a better place and will continue to do so.While this book will appeal to the history buff, especially someone vitally concerned with the events and personalities of the Second World War (though Ambrose makes an argument that it was The Great War, Part 2), and is certainly required reading for any of Ambrose's many fans, it is also fascinating to anyone interested in America's history, or to the process of studying and making sense of history. Two things I took away from this book are that history is the study of people, their decisions and the consequences of those decisions, and that we are all, even now, writing the history of the future, that the consequences of our decisions will either redeem us or damn us, even though we will not live to receive either calumny or praise. ",
                    "No doubt many of you have memories of history class as a dry uninteresting subject where memorizing some key characters and dates was what was required to make it through to the next level. Today history is one of my favorite genres to read and learn and I've discovered that there are actually writers who have the ability to make history interesting as well as educational. In To America: Personal Reflections of an Historian, Stephen E. Ambrose, one of the country's most influential historians, reflects on his long career as an American historian and explains what an historian's job is all about. He also shares insights and behind the scenes looks at how he pulls together the good and the bad about our predecessors as he writes about their stories with triumphs and tragedies and all that goes with that. I have read several of his books and have found them to be captivating in how he presents his thoroughly researched topics and actually brings history to life. He takes a few swings at the political correctness craze of today, as well as his own early biases, as he grapples with the country's historic sins of racism, its neglect and ill treatment of Native Americans, and its tragic errors. He reflects on some of the country's early founders who were progressive thinkers while living a contradiction as slaveholders including Washington and Jefferson. He contemplates many of the key events in our history, many of which are contained in his books such as the stunning victory over the British in the War of 1812, the grueling journey of Lewis and Clark to open up the newly acquired territory to the west, and the building of the transcontinental railroad that joined it and greatly reduced the time to safely travel from the east to the west.The author explains and records America's assumption of world power under the leadership of Theodore Roosevelt, and extols its heroic victory in World War II. He writes about women's rights and civil rights and immigration, founding museums, and nation- building. He contrasts the presidencies of Dwight Eisenhower, John F. Kennedy, Richard Nixon, and Lyndon B. Johnson and the misunderstood presidency of Ulysses S. Grant. Throughout, Ambrose celebrates the unflappable American spirit. Throughout all of this, Ambrose writes about writing history. To America is an instant classic for all those interested in history, patriotism, and the love of writing.",
                    "In this random collection of things Ambrose wants to talk about, he tries to leave behind his school of Old White Male History, but he just can't. Nor he can avoid a sometimes stunningly Amerocentric attitude. When Americans win a war or a battle, they do it with more glory and bravery than was ever seen before in history. When they accomplish some feat, it is better than any feat that ever came before. And when they form a hatred towards someone, that too is stronger than anyone else's hatred. (I might suggest he take a closer look at Asian relations.) Most of the book is made up of reflections on the traditional stuff: wars, presidents, and of the few of these I read, it was more than obvious he wrote about them not only out of personal interest but because he had done significant research on them throughout his career. Once or twice he tackled topics of social history, and it was also clear they held only a passing curiosity for him. Women's lib was almost entirely about his mother and two wives' experiences in the home and at work with almost no commentary on female society as a whole in the US (let alone how their experiences differed wildly by class and race) and wound up congratulating the US on leading the world in this field while blatantly ignoring decades of data on how European society is ahead of us by leagues when it comes to women's equality in the workplace. But I digress. I did learn some things. I liked reading about Teddy Roosevelt, but in the end, I had to put this book down before I threw it across the room.",
                    "Stephen Ambrose gives some overall thoughts on what America actually is, using his decades of scholarship, study and writing to back himself up. He defends several critiques of American history: the bombing of Japan in WWII, for example, or the myth of Native American harmony with nature. He speaks at length about the work involved in history scholarship, and through his description, his love becomes the reader's as well. Must say, I'm a bit irritated at Ambrose on occasion in this book (God rest his soul). He argues that no one could find fault with Western expansionism, or else they'd have to tell the immigrants and surveyors they had to go back to New York, Boston or Chicago rather than push westward, taking the natives' lands, and who would agree to say such a thing? I would. He also compares the pleasure of blowing a steam engine horn to the pleasure of an orgasm. Yeah. He lost me right there, too. But there's plenty else he says worth listening to. I don't know if this was the last book he wrote before succumbing to lung cancer in 2002 or so, but it's a fitting elegy regardless. Nixon dismissively referred to Ambrose, the man who'd written a three-volume biography of him as evenhanded as anyone could possibly pull off, as just another liberal historian. Wuh. Dick, pal, that guy was in your court more than you'll ever know. He was in all of our courts. That's an American. ",
                    "With such masterpieces as Undaunted Courage, Band of Brothers and D-Day, it is difficult to write a negative review of Stephen Ambrose's epitaph contemplation To America: Personal Reflections of An Historian. Ambrose applies 21st century thought to 18th century events, a sin by any historian's standards. Within the first 5 pages, Ambrose stoops to discounting Thomas Jefferson, the author of the Declaration of Independence, as a racist, a bigot and an intellectual coward (how can any historian discount the structure of slavery in 18th century aristocracy or the fact that Jefferson's prominence was a result of it? - albeit a horrific scar on American history). Although the other end of the spectrum is represented, such overpowering treatment continues throughout the book.One bright spot in the book is the objective treatment of Richard Nixon, although the subject is not susceptible to Ambrose's disappointing jabs. It is important for the reader to take this book with a teaspoon of salt, the tag-line title must be considered, that this is Ambrose's personal reflection. His decision to keep his own opinion at bay in his previous work was a wise one as Ambrose seems more determined to end his legacy as a controversialist (evidenced by his frequent recounting of his own protest attendance) than an objective voice of history.I would advise potential readers to the leave To America on the shelf and read, and re-read, Ambrose's 25 other published treasures.

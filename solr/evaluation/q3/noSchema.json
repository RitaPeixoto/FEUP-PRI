                    "Yet another fantastic book from Lindsay S Nixon. This one was chockful of fantastic recipes like Lindsay's other books but this one had an added bonus: it read not only like a cookbook but a mini biography and mini travelogue replete with beautiful photos from the author's trips all over the world. biography - checktravelogue - checkcookbook - check",
                    "Overall, I'm a fan of Happy Herbivore. Her recipes are simple and rely on easy-to-find ingredients. Since I follow a vegan, no-added-fat way of eating, they are right up my alley. Her style is a bit simplistic for me and honestly her writing can be a bit..young? For example, I didn't expect to see a reference to hookers and potheads (referring to Amsterdam) in a cookbook. Maybe I'm just old-fashioned that way. This review is mainly about the format of this cookbook rather than the content. First of all, I understand that it is a travelogue and while I enjoyed the pics, it made the book too busy, I myself would have appreciated more recipes and fewer photos. Diehard fans (called Herbies)will appreciate cute pics of Lindsay frolicking in the parks &amp, streets of various European cities, eating gelato, etc. but that's just not my thing. The recipes themselves were clear and concise, yet I hate paragraph format, much prefer bullet style! I would also prefer to have all of the recipes from each country together instead of being separated by appetizer, main dish, etc. If I wanted to plan an Italian meal, for example, I had to search all over the book for various components, found that a bit confusing. Bottom line: This is a solid cookbook for the newly-vegan (or plant-based, as Lindsay refers to herself) or those who want to explore foods from other countries. I can see myself copying my favorites into my recipe program and then passing along the book to someone else, the format is just too distracting to me. ",
                    "This book is AMAZING! Not only am I a pescetarian, but I'm also allergic to gluten, soy and dairy. Guess what this book has almost ALL gluten free recipes, and many that are soy free and of course dairy free (Vegan cookbook). This is the FIRST cookbook I have ever bought that I am actually looking forward to cooking from! All the recipes are easy, delicious and just so fun! It is a must have for any kitchen, maybe you'll have a guest like me for dinner some time? hahaAnyway, all the recipes are VERY affordable and made from COMMON ingredients which make it even easier to cook from. There is nothing too fancy or over complicated, it is just good, homemade classic dishes that taste a hell of a lot like grandma's stew, or mom's goulash.All in all, I love it, and it is my new recommendation to my friends and family. ",
                    "Wow, my friend switched to Vegan a few months ago and has been letting me try her lunches, most from this author. Surprisingly delicious! I have been suffering from a lot of health issues and reading the benefits of going Vegan have me leaning towards it. Reading through this cook book that is filled with tons of pictures made my mouth water. Everything sounds delicious, it tells you where the recipe is from, usually a picture and substitutes you can make if needed. I can't wait to cook some of these for myself, they all sound really easy to make, no culinary degree needed!",
                    "We discovered Lindsay Nixon online where she generously shares many of her low oil, vegan recipes. Based on her consistently wonderful and healthy recipes, we bought the only Happy Herbivore book our local Barnes &amp, Noble had in stock. Great recipes, wonderful photographs and top shelf all the way.In fact, the vegan Belgian Waffle recipe on p. 160 is worth paying full price for this book alone. Highly recommended without reservation."

                    "After vegan chef Lindsay S. Nixon wrapped up her popular cookbook The Happy Herbivore Cookbook last year, she went back to her kitchen in her new home of St. Maarten. Island living encouraged her to come up with simpler recipes, which led her to create a follow-up cookbook with a focus on recipes that bring tasty back to quick-and-easy.Now, in Nixon’s much-anticipated follow-up cookbook, Everyday Happy Herbivore, readers will see, once again, that just because plant-based eating is optimal for health, that doesn’t mean it has to be expensive or time-consuming.Everyday Happy Herbivore will include more than 175 doable recipes—recipes that are so quick and easy, you could cook three healthy meals from scratch every day.Each of Nixon’s recipes are made with wholesome, easy-to-find, fresh ingredients and include no added fats. With additional notes indicating recipes that are ideal for preparing ahead of time and those you can whip up with just a few dollars, Everyday Happy Herbivore will be the must-have cookbook for anyone desiring a healthier, happier menu!"

This could be user error, but I've had lots of success with other cookbooks and recipes (like Nava Atlas or fatfreevegan.com)--so who knows. The recipes are easy to prepare, and many of them are incredibly inexpensive as well, so there are probably a couple I'll make again, but likely with some tweaks. ",

                    "(read partly because I needed more N-authors on my list, partly because it was a quick read)So, this is a cookbook of 150+ recipes, most with photographs. The recipes are low-fat, with nutritional information for each, and tips with many, some suggesting different ways of doing recipes or replacing some ingredient with another (if you want something soy-free or gluten-free, for example).Smoothies, yoghurst &amp, granola, hot breakfasts &amp, brunch, muffins, bisquits &amp, breads, sandwiches, burgers &amp, more, soups, stews &amp, dal, salads &amp, dressings, stir-frieds &amp, curries, casseroles &amp, rice dishes, beans &amp, faux meat, pasta &amp, noodles, simple sides, desserts, condiments &amp, spice blends, sauces &amp, gravies, diy food stuff.There's also an appendix of glossary of ingredients, substitutions, kitchen prep lingo and metric conversions.My favorites include:Cinnamon bun smoothie, P. chocolate smoothie, Peanut butter cup smoothie, Mexican scramble, Dark chocolate pancakes, Jalopeño cornbread, Masala burgers, Shiitake miso soup, Ethiopian chickpea stew, NOLA gumbo, Mexican chowder, Southwest chop salad, Thai lettuce wraps + peanut sauce, Spicy mushroom stir-fry, Sweet &amp, sour tempeh, Chana saag, Fiesta bake, Dijon rice with broccoli, Skillet frijoles negros, Chickpea tenders, Cuban black bean cakes, Cajun chickpea cakes, Creamy dijon pasta, Tempeh chili mac, Spicy orange greens, Cajun potato salad, Soft molasses cookies, Chai-oat cookies, and Pineapple sponge cake.The author's year-long stay at St Maarten, Caribbean plays an influence. There's certainly enough bananas included! Also see much use of garlic/onion powder, which feels a bit bizarre to me, since I don't use those. Some recipes felt kinda obvious and basic (and not all photographs look great: the skillet refried beans photo should have been replace with something more appealing approach - it doesn't look very tasty to me).But the book does have plenty of good recipes, some great ideas, and being able to do things quickly and simply (good for a beginner, I'd say) does put this book's rating on the good side, and worth buying it, for me :)",
                    "The Happy Herbivore's refreshing, quick, urban market, small-kitchen friendly vegan cooking brings the goods meal after meal. Whether trying out Meatless Mondays, incorporating more vegan meals, or living fully vegan, the Happy Herbivore has delicious quick easy recipes.Although I once could spend hours happily in the kitchen, living with a painful mobility disorder has meant I need quick, healthy food. One of the realities for many of us who live with chronic pain is the bowl of cereal dinner, breakfast, lunch, dinner again. Truly fast (a half-hour is terribly long if you're really hurting), many of the recipes can be set up and prepared in under 15 minutes. Lindsay's cookbooks have given me back some of that happy time in the kitchen, and far more nourishing meals, with greater variety, than is possible rolling through the convenience and prepared foods sections of markets. Fast, delicious, mostly inexpensive, and possible - that's my kind of cookbook.",
                    "  I was not satisfied with the quality of recipes. The low-fat diet trend is of dubious medical benefit, and the recipes in this book made little effort to challenge the status quo when it comes to bland, textureless vegan food. I have read many vegan cookbooks that offered a wide variety of ethnic cuisines and tried to incorporate many types of food in order to diversify the vegan dirt. Happy Herbivore's author seems to enjoy low-fat vegan versions of a five-year old's palate of foods. On the positive side, these recipes were truly easy to prepare. I was not introduced to any unfamiliar cooking techniques. The TVP tacos were dead easy to prepare and relatively tasty for TVP. I ended up adding healthy fats to almost every recipe, however, in the form of nuts, avocados, or small amounts of veg oil. ",

                    "As a pastry chef, and a baker who tries to bake without eggs and dairy, I was really looking forward to this one! Unfortunately, while it has many nice recipes and ideas I'm somehow disappointed... I'm giving it 3 *, purely because of few nice cake and cupcakes recipes in there, but I still think it's more of a 2* cookbook as a whole. Before you shout at me here (and I did notice that the book has mostly positive reviews) let me explain.No, I'm not 100% vegan, yes I do try to have more plant based diet, for many reasons (health being the most important one), I am also professional pastry chef who's trying to do more vegan desserts at work - to show bigger audience that vegan desserts can and ARE delicious. You don't have to sacrifice on taste! As such, I'm always looking for vegan dessert recipes and ideas - from cakes, to pies and ice creams - and here is where I have a problem with this book.Why, WHY would I want a cookbook, baking/desserts book in particular, to tell me to go and BUY a tub of vegan vanilla ice cream to add something to it, and voila you have vegan flavoured ice cream! Really? Then we're off to the shop again to buy different kinds of pastry (but remember, make sure it's dairy free etc.) Really? Vegan butter and margarine present in most recipes - how about alternatives like coconut, rapeseed etc? I did substitute vegan butter with coconut oil in some cakes - as vegan butter is nowhere to be seen on the shelves of my local shops. And there was me, thinking naively that the whole point of writing a vegan desserts cookbook is to show/teach others how to create/bake things yourself, at home - you know, for that home made taste/experience, to show that it's NOT that difficult to switch to/be on a plant based diet. And what about those of us who do not have access to vegan ice cream in their shops, huh? Even though I live in Ireland I'm still struggling to find vegan ice cream in the local supermarket, and if I finally, eventually do happen to come across one - it's usually 5 times the price of the normal ones...I DO understand that most of us lead busy lives, that we all do shortcuts in the kitchen - but do I really need a cookbook to tell me to buy a tub of plain vanilla ice cream and mix it with something, or to put some fruit on top of shop-bought pastry and bake it...? As far as I know - all those products already come with similar tips on their packaging... ",
                    "OMG...I NEED this book! The thing I love most is that it is NOT an allergy-free book. It is vegan: no dairy, no eggs. For someone who loves to bake (me) who has a child with severe food allergies (dairy, beef, outgrew egg and peanut) desserts have always been a challenge. This book's pictures alone had me drooling! Really, seriously, a non-dairy whip cream recipe! For those who can't comprehend the joy of this discovery, just consider yourselves lucky. This book is inspiring, I almost want to open a vegan bakery! But I wouldn't even say the V-word because so many people turn their noses up at it. I have had people turn down a cookie or brownie once I tell them that it is non-dairy or safe for my daughter. When I don't mention it, I have had grown men fighting their children over my (non-dairy) chocolate chip bars and have called my (non-dairy) triple chocolate brownies SINFUL. Yes, I am that good! HAHAHA. I have cooked without eggs before and to be honest I'd rather not use them. She does add extra directions for those who are gluten-free, but thankfully, we don't have to deal with that one. I will also forgive Chloe the ultra tiny waist but only because of the way she talks about her food--I know she actually eats it. Must have a high metabolism. I am looking forward to trying many recipes from this book: Double Crust Fudge Bars, Mocha Mud Pie, Frozen Mocha Latte, Vodka Basil Lemonade (for me), and finally, from my school cafeteria childhood, Chocolate PB Fudge."

                    " Finding a really good vegan baking book has been hard to do in the sea of them hitting the shelves I had tried many and not found the one till-This one is a winner. First I love the beautiful photographs they make you want to taste them. The recipes are easy to follow, precise and have ingredients that are easy to find. I made four different recipes from the book and all came out delicious, but one stole my doughnut loving heart. The Baked chocolate Doughnuts recipe is what I have been looking for, they were light, just the right texture, and tasted just the way they should. If you are a vegan baker or just looking for something lighter to bake, this is the book.",
                    "Veganism can have a bit of a bad reputation for those who are not adherents. Mostly due to ignorance and unfamiliarity. Yet more and more people are turning to veganism or another restricted dietary regime. So for the converted, this can be a good additional resource. For the uninitiated it can be a good education aand show you that veganism does not necessary mean bland, tasteless and lacking in things.The author has turned away from typical vegan staples such as tofu, applesauce, egg replacer and mashed bananas in favour of liquid proportions and leaveners like baking soda and vinegar to make cakes rise and remain moist. As well as making her own version of classics such as crème brulee and tiramisu there are a number of homespun delights such as lemon olive oil cake with rosemary ice cream. Lemon olive oil cake, you might ask, whilst pulling a face… yet now is the chance to perhaps try something totally different and be pleasantly surprised.Certainly this is a light read and you don't get the feeling of being hectored (if you are a non vegan). Vegans will already be sold on the idea and not need any convincing. The author gives the impression of being open and care-free, even talking about catching her hair once in a mixer and having to walk around with a melon-shaped knot in her hair for some time! Things start after a light-hearted introduction with an overview of common pantry items and this was, in fact, a rather essential, illuminating read for a non vegan. Even though many ingredients are familiar it was interesting nonetheless to learn additional uses and opinions as to their versatility.Consideration is also given to allergy-free baking, such as gluten-free, soy-free and sugar-free, with a brief explanation of acceptable substitutions.Then it is time to get cooking! The recipes are well presented with a clear introduction, ingredients list (sadly with only imperial measurements) and very explanatory, simple instructions to follow. Regrettably there is no estimation of a typical preparation or cooking time though. Many tips and hints are also dotted throughout the book and the photographs of the finished items are simplistic, honest and visually to the point. This reviewer challenges any non vegan with a sweet tooth not to find something of interest within this book, based on the photographs alone. You will be hooked!The recipes themselves are split into chapters - dessert for breakfast, cookies &amp, bars, pies, tarts &amp, cobblers, cakes &amp, cupcakes, spoon desserts, drink up! and basics with a full listing at the start of the book. There is also an index at the rear but this was not present in the review copy. Quite why a second index is necessary, unless it is sorted by basic ingredients, remains to be seen as the contents listing is sufficiently comprehensive to locate each recipe. So it may just be a welcome additional bonus.There seems to be a lot of blank spaces at the end of many recipes that appear to have no purpose nor the feeling of anything being omitted. Hopefully it is just a factor of this pre-publication review copy as it seems very odd and out of character with the book's overall high production values. But then, if there is something missing, it is very frustrating to not know what it is, whilst not considering something is missing. Hopefully the space can be used for even more scrumptious photographs.So, overall this is a great book. This reviewer tended to tune out that it was a vegan book as the various dishes were so enchanting, interesting and different. As a meat eater maybe it would be a step too far for now to convert to veganism but certainly, based on the recipes seen within this book, it wouldn't be a hardship to eat vegan desserts every now and then. If you are entertaining and a guest is a vegan, this is a perfect resource. Just follow it and relax!Chloe's Vegan Desserts: More than 100 Exciting New Recipes for Cookies and Pies, Tarts and Cobblers, Cupcakes and Cakes--and More!, written by Chloe Coscarelli and published by Atria Books.

                    "One of the better things in life and living it healthy is eating healthy food. This is a fact that cannot be denied. In comes Chloe Coscarelli, winner of the very first Cupcake Wars on Food Network. I saw that particular war and figured here is a beautiful woman who thinks she can make a difference, an opinion shared by my girlfriends who laughed and called out to the show Good Luck! When she won it, we ate our words. Who would ever have thought, VEGAN desserts? It was like saying that desserts should be bland, never sweet, it was like saying cupcakes should taste like cardboard. When it was announced that Chloe's Vegan Desserts: More than 100 Exciting New Recipes for Cookies and Pies, Tarts and Cobblers, Cupcakes and Cakes--and More!was going to come out, I immediately pounced on the chance to get hold of a copy and try it out for myself. This, I said to myself, would be a challenge to the woman herself as I lived in an area where going Vegan would mean starving to death.Here's the blurb:CHEF CHLOE’S first all-dessert cookbook, Chloe’s Vegan Desserts, will satisfy your sweet tooth from morning to night with more than 100 recipes for cakes and cupcakes, ice cream and doughnuts and pies—oh my! And you just will not believe these delicious dishes are vegan. You can start the day with New York–Style Crumb Cake, light and zesty Lemon Poppy Seed Muffins, luscious Chocolate Babka, or decadent Tiramisu Pancakes (topped with a dollop of cool Coconut Whipped Cream). Here, too, are more than a dozen inventive, innovative, irresistible cupcake recipes, including Chloe’s Cupcake Wars’ Award-Winning Chocolate Orange Cupcakes with Candied Orange Peel, saffron- and cardamom-spiced Bollywood Cupcakes, and rich and boozy Chocolate Beer Cupcakes with Irish Whiskey Buttercream.Chloe’s got you covered for the holidays with her Easy Apple Pie and Absolutely Perfect Pumpkin Pie, Holiday Trifle, Nuts for Hot Cocoa, and Pumpkin Spice Latte. She re-creates classic desserts and treats from Chocolate Chip Cookies to Classic Crème Brûlée, and veganizes store-bought favorites with her Oreo-style Chloe O’s, Pumpkin Whoopie Pies, Animal Cookies, and Black-and-White Cookies—which are better (and healthier) than what you’ll find at the grocery store. Chloe also serves up brand-new triumphs like her dreamy Lemon Olive-Oil Cake, Rosemary Ice Cream with Blueberry Sauce, Coconut Cream Pie, Chocolate Cream Pie, Coconut Sorbet with Cashew Brittle, and good-to-the-last-drop milkshakes. Who can possibly resist?Go ahead and lick that spoon—there are no worries when you bake vegan! With gorgeous color photography, clever tips, and a comprehensive section on vegan baking basics to get you started, Chloe’s Vegan Desserts will be your new vegan dessert bible.Hmmmm, I wonder if the publishers knew something I did not. Again, living in an area where going vegetarian was challenging enough, much more going all the way to Vegan.So I opened the book, and first thing I checked were the ingredients. At the same time I opened my pantry and checked the items in it. All this time I just KNEW that ingredients in this book would be challenging to find. 30 minutes later, after going through the inventory, I realized something: all the ingredients she listed I found in my pantry. Not only were they there, they were readily available everywhere. This made me feel dumb. This means that I had not gone through the effort of going healthy even when I had all the ingredients. I went through this book with my hubby and he looked at me and challenged me to follow the recipes. Of course I took on the challenge. I have to honestly say that I have not finished this book. Reason is because I have not tried all the recipes, so far I have only gone through 5 of them. Stupid me, Hurrah! for Chloe! I have successfully followed her recipes for Pumpkin Pie, Banana Bread Cobbler, Dark Chocolate Fudge Cake, Cherry Hand Pie and Lemon Thyme Tea Cookies (which goes very well with Earl Grey Tea). Will I continue using this book? My family expects desserts everyday, this may be my only chance in giving them their just desserts, the healthy way. Thank you Chloe!",
                    "This poor book has been idling in my currently reading stack for a while now. Since I have cooked a few things from it, thought I should finally review it. ,-)I have been following Chloe Coscarelli after seeing her win Cupcake Wars on The Food Network several years ago. I have all three of her cookbooks and want to try her very popular NYC vegan cafes someday. She makes vegan cooking simple and approachable with her recipes and explanations. Many of the dishes can be made with simple pantry ingredients and the ones I have tried have been tasty and came together well. I am not a big baker so I have not baked from this dessert book, but the three recipes I have tried: Nuts for Hot Cocoa (vegan hot chocolate with nut butter), simple Chocolate Sauce (great for drizzling over fruit or non-dairy ice cream, and her Chocolate Mousse have all been easy and delicious. Probably a regular baker would get more out of this book but I like it for a reference for simple vegan desserts.Here's a link to the Chocolate Mousse recipe from my blog. It was truly wonderful--creamy and so delicious with fruit, even non-vegan eaters would appreciate it. http://kahakaikitchen.blogspot.com/20...",
                    "Chloe Coscarelli has done it again – made being vegan so easy and delicious!As the winner of Food Network’s Cupcake Wars and the author of Chloe’s Kitchen, Chloe has proven herself when it comes to vegan cooking, but Chloe’s Vegan Desserts is an absolute treat (pun intended). It is filled with delicious recipes that are packed with flavor. Everything from Tiramisu Pancakes to Raspberry Coffee Cake, and from Chocolate Doughnuts to Pumpkin Pie has been made vegan and simple. There are options for making recipes gluten and soy-free, but you never have to sacrifice on taste with these goodies.Chloe is realistic about baking – while everyone loves a treat, not everyone has the time to spend hours in the kitchen. With these recipes, it is easy to make Pumpkin Cinnamon Rolls and Apple Cider Doughnut Holes, and a delicious Chocolate Babka.You honestly cannot go wrong with this book – it is packed with flavors that you will crave year round, and Chloe’s approachable style which makes vegan baking so much fun! From shelfishness.blog.com",
                    "Chloe's Vegan Desserts is a different kind of vegan baking cookbook. Her finished products resemble non-vegan textures by using baking science rather than relying on simply substituting ingredients. Coscarelli is the author of Chloe's Kitchen and was the first vegan winner of Cupcake Wars.The recipes take you from breakfast treats to cookies in seven chapters: Desserts for Breakfast, Cookies and Bars, Pies, Tarts, and Cobblers, Cakes and Cupcakes, Spoon Desserts, Drink Up!, and Basics. Her two intro chapters, Sweet Pantry and Allergy-Free Baking, provide great resources for those experimenting or are new to vegan and specialty diet baking.The pictures are clear, and the recipes easy to assemble. Mostly, she shows in the book as in her appearance in Cake Wars that vegan baking is more than baking with vegan ingredients - it's baking that looks and tastes good.Note: This review was posted to my baking blog, along with an adapted version of her coconut whipped cream (made of a can of coconut milk).",
                    "Chloe's Vegan Desserts is a great vegan dessert cookbook for beginners. I was surprised by how easy the recipes were to make and how tasty/moist/just right the baked goods came out from the oven. I was impressed, given how most of the recipes did not require ingredients that went beyond the everyday pantry basics. And my pantry is by no means stocked to the fullest extent. Desserts for Breakfast, Cookies and Bars and Cakes and Cupcakes have been my go-to sections. I love a good loaf cake recipe and the raspberry swirl coffee cake is amazing. Chocolate babka? Amazing. I got great feedback when I made Yoga Cupcakes and Hot-Fudge-on-the-Bottom Cake. I fell in love with the Cinnamon Mocha Cupcakes. But the ultimate winner? Banana bread cobbler. You really do not want to share this granola cake confection. "

                    "for me: 2 to 3 stars, and I suspect for many: 4 to 5 starsI almost didn’t read this book because its title is so unappealing to me. I am not a carnivore, not even an omnivore at heart. I don’t miss meat, and I tend to like naturally vegan foods. I like Ellen, and Portia, and a few Goodreads’ friends convinced me to read it, and I’m glad that I did. I greatly admire celebrities when they use their influence for good, and this book (among other things) is a good example of that. Creating a 100% vegan cookbook that has mainstream appeal is a laudable act. The author-chef is the personal chef for DeGeneres &amp, de Rossi.However, while I found a few tempting recipes, overall for me, there is too much salt, too much oil, too many faux meat and other animal similar foods, and foods I don’t enjoy such as vegan mayo, mustard, vinegar, and the majority of the recipes require more work than I am willing to put in, at least on any kind of regular basis. There are quite a few easy to make recipes and I’m aware that I dislike many flavors others like. I am glad I read this cookbook, but I’m also glad it was a library book.This is a fabulous cookbook for cooks who don’t mind spending some time in the kitchen, who want to eat vegan but who enjoy animal based foods, for fans of Ellen DeGeneres and Portia de Rossi, and cooks who want access to chef created recipes.I appreciated that the recipes are international, with some from the U.S. south, where Ellen is from.The photos are great, with luscious looking photos of many of the recipes, helpful photos of food preparation for a few of the recipes, wonderful photos of people, including Ellen &amp, Portia and the chef author and his family, with some absolutely adorable ones of the author’s young son helping prepare food.Ellen’s short piece was good and inspiring, and the chef’s was very interesting. Portia’s nearly brought me to tears, it was very emotionally touching. Her short story alone is worth reading this book. There are some interestingly written blurbs by the chef at many of the recipes, several of them amusing. The chef seems like an especially nice guy.Most of the recipes did not appeal to me but I think they will to many others. If I could do 2 star ratings, I’d assign 2 ½ stars for myself and 4 ½ stars for others. Some recipes I can see making as is or with minor adaptations are:from Breakfasts: Buckwheat Pancakes, Quinoa and Berries Breakfast Cereal, Whole Wheat Waffles with Maple-Berry Syrup, Tofu Scramble with Springtime Vegetables and Crispy Potato Squaresfrom Appetizers and Snacks: Kale Chipsfrom Soups: Potato Leek Soup, French Onion Soup, Creamy Grilled Asparagus Soupfrom Pizza, Pasta, and Pasta Sauces: Potato Gnocchi in Sage Brown Butter, Homemade Ravioli with Tofu Burrata and Portobello Mushrooms, Wild Mushroom Tomato Sauce, Almond Pestofrom Entrées: Shiitake Lettuce Cups, Southwest Rice and Beans, Baby Bok Choy with Crispy Tofu and Sprouted Brown Ricefrom Sides: Mac ‘n Cheese, Risotto, Twice-Baked Potato, Roasted Butternut Squash and Yams with Caramelized Leeks, Grilled Polenta Cakes, Garlic and Herb Baby Red Potatoes, Creamed Spinachfrom Beverages: Agua de Melon (Melon Water)from Desserts: Peach Crisp, Mexican Wedding Cookies, Vegan La Bete Noir (the Black Beast), Chocolate Chip Cookiesfrom Condiments, Sauces, and Dressings: Cashew Cream, Blackening Spice, Pico de Gallo, Dark Red Mole Sauce, Quick Enchilada Sauce, Charred Red Onions, Orange Citrus DressingContents:Foreword by Portia de RossiIntroduction: From Carnivore to Vegan ChefThe Pantry and Some BasicsChapter 1: BreakfastChapter 2: LunchChapter 3: Appetizers and SnacksChapter 4: SoupsChapter 5: SaladsChapter 6: Pizza, Pasta, and Pasta Sauces Chapter 7: EntréesChapter 8: SidesChapter 9: BeveragesChapter 10: DessertsChapter 11: Condiments, Sauces, DressingsAfterword by Ellen DeGeneresAcknowledgmentsIndex",
                    "This cookbook is a must-have in every vegan kitchen! I haven't been this impressed by a vegan cookbook in awhile and it's rare for me (being that I'm such a picky eater) to find a cookbook where I want to make practically every recipe!It begins with a very well written foreword by Portia De Rossi, where she shares the moment she first decided to go vegan (which made me tear up because it's so amazing). Next is a great introduction by Roberto: From Carnivore to Vegan Chef, followed by The Pantry and Some Basics (a great and handy list of important ingredients to keep in your pantry). Roberto also covers a few tips on knives, brand name vegan products, why using freshly ground black pepper is best and techniques for soaking beans and preparing tofu.Now it's time for the good stuff! The book is divided into sections: Breakfast (I swear the book is worth it for this section alone!), Lunch, Appetizers and Snacks, Soups, Salads, Pizza, Pasta and Pasta Sauces, Entrees, Sides, Beverages, Desserts, Condiments-Sauces and Dressings. Awesome, right? :)Some of the highlights for me: Whole Wheat Waffles with Maple-Berry Syrup (wait until you see the picture, it's glorious!), Tofu Benedict with Chipotle Cream, Tofu Egg Salad, Tofu Crab Cakes, Tortilla Soup, Spicy Noodle Salad, Blackened Tofu Caesar Salad, Southern Fried Chick'n, Pierogi, Faux Pho, Mac n' Cheese, Grilled Polenta Cakes, Corn Pudding, Pumpkin Pie, Peach Crisp. All this deliciousness is then followed by an afterword from Ellen. Overall, this is a wonderful book that has me anxious to get into the kitchen!",
                    "Generally I'm not a fan of vegetarian or vegan cooking that merely substitutes tofu, Chick'n, and other products for meat and dairy, but I am very willing to make an exception for these recipes. To be honest, I picked up this cookbook specifically because of the title--for carnivores--because holiday cooking for the meat-happy and veggie-adverse folks in my family can be challenging. The avocado reuben sandwich is delicious, soaking tofu in kalamata olive brine to make a feta-like salty &amp, crumbly substance is actually kind of inspired, and the fruity snack balls have been a big hit as appetizers and as hiking and biking treats.",
                    "This book really is amazing. It got my father - the die hard meat and potatoes man - to try and actually LIKE vegan food. He's actually excited about it now. He may not switch over to veganism because of it - but he at least eats vegan meals with me and doesn't complain about it anymore. That's a HUGE step!",
                    "  I have tons of vegan cookbooks and bought this on a whim, not really expecting it to be anything special. It turns out that I love it. I am cooking me way through it now. The recipes are well written and provide a good selection of various types of foods from fancy to casual. And it has many great photos. ",

                    "Chloe Coscarelli always has great vegan recipes. :-) Love the idea for this book - veganizing your favourite dishes. This book has some focus on weight loss, which I'm not a fan of, to eat vegan just to lose weight. But I just skipped over that onto the recipes and they are great and easy!",
                    "So far I've made the Tomato-Basil Bisque (my husband said it was the best tomato soup he's ever had and he's a tomato soup connoisseur), the Fettuccine Alfredo (really good), Penne alla Vodka with the Best Garlic Bread in the World (this was my favorite - the garlic bread lives up to its name), the Mongolian BBQ Seitan using her seitan recipe in the back of the book (the sauce was good although I'd made something very similar on my own before out of ingredients in my fridge, so nothing revolutionary and the seitan wasn't great - on the rubbery side and didn't taste like much), and the Macaroni and Cheese, although I made the stovetop version from her blog which is identical up until the sprinkle with breadcrumbs and bake steps (good and fast but definitely not my favorite vegan macaroni and cheese recipe). I've made and enjoyed at least one other recipe from her blog too. It's no doubt she has some great recipes. She explains everything clearly so it's not difficult to follow the directions and get the same results in your kitchen. She also uses fairly normal ingredients that I'm able to get at my grocery store. The only thing she called for that I've never seen before is canned lentils. Only dried lentils 'round these parts.I didn't give the book five stars because it's light on the photos. There are no photos at all of several of the recipes which is pretty lame, in my opinion. Her (free) blog has photos and she clearly hired a food photographer for this (not-free) book so what's the excuse for not having at least one photo for each recipe? We need to know how the finished product is supposed to look! Also, the index is not great.",
                    "Chloe has a very wide variety of recipes in her book. There are dinner party-type appetizers, hearty burgers and Italian pastas, Asian and Carribbean-inspired fare and oh-so-mouthwatering desserts.While I waited for this to become available at the library I went ahead &amp, made a few dishes from Chloe's blog. These included: ~Pad Thai Noodles, 4* (so tasty, will be putting in regular rotation)~Roasted Apple, Butternut Squash &amp, Caramelized Onion Pizza, 3* (I pretty much love every pizza, but this was ho-hum, great the first night and pretty bland warming up the next day) ~Chocolate Chip Banana Cake, 5* Awesome~Mac 'n Cheese, 4* (This is in her book, only with bread crumbs and baked, I thought it was too salty)After these pretty good successes, I was looking forward to exploring all the recipes in her book. ~Mongolian BBQ Seitan, 4* Fun dish!~Shallot-Dijon Vinaigrette, 1* (All it tasted like was oil!)~Herbed Polenta Cutlets with Marsala Mushroom Ragout, 3*~Garlicky Greens, 2* (I've had much better)~Yoga Cookies, 3*So basically you get a very mixed bag. Also, she seems to rely on too much salt and oil. You could probably stand to cut way back on those in many recipes without sacrificing taste. There are plenty of recipes that I still want to try, so I'll probably be checking this one out again, but I certainly would not buy it without trying tasting more. ",
                    "Pro's- Simple recipes, both in regards to ingredients and assembly. Good for people starting to eat a plant based diet and to cook vegan.Con's- The pictures of the food are nice, but they should have included more pictures of food and less of Chloe, I mean, she isn't hard on the eyes but this is a cookbook. The design is very simplistic, and the content a little childish at times- this girl is a classically trained chef that worked at Millenium (have you seen their cookbook? pure vegan bliss)! I was hoping to see a bit more complexity and maturity in the recipes and the content.Some of the content does not belong. Putting avocado on toast does not belong in a cookbook. It belongs in your brain, under, 'simple things to do with bread'. Other vegan cookbooks offer more bang for the buck, but it makes a nice addition to my vegan cookbook collection. ***They claim healthy cooking, but I will offer the disclaimer that vegan food does not always equal healthy food. Things like coconut milk, oils, vegan butter, and nuts are all very good for you but, like all fats, in limited quantities. While some of these recipes are certainly health-ier than their non vegan counterparts, they are not all healthy.",
                    "Likes: Make ahead tips, easy to follow instructionsDislikes: Some of the recipes to me weren't recipes, Avocado on Toast to me is not a recipe. Some of the pictures throughout the book were of Chloe instead of food, I would much rather have seen more pictures of the food.Overall I think this would be a good cookbook for anyone who wants to give vegan cooking a try."

                    "The #1 New York Times bestseller answers: What if one simple change could save you from heart disease, diabetes, and cancer? For decades, that question has fascinated a small circle of impassioned doctors and researchers—and now, their life-changing research is making headlines in the hit documentary Forks Over Knives. Their answer? Eat a whole-foods, plant-based diet—it could save your life. It may overturn most of the diet advice you’ve heard—but the experts behind Forks Over Knives aren’t afraid to make waves. In his book Prevent and Reverse Heart Disease, Dr. Caldwell Esselstyn explained that eating meat, dairy, and oils injures the lining of our blood vessels, causing heart disease, heart attack, or stroke. In The China Study, Dr. Colin Campbell revealed how cancer and other diseases skyrocket when eating meat and dairy is the norm—and plummet when a traditional plant-based diet persists. And more and more experts are adding their voices to the cause: There is nothing else you can do for your health that can match the benefits of a plant-based diet. Now, as Forks Over Knives is introducing more people than ever before to the plant-based way to health, this accessible guide provides the information you need to adopt and maintain a plant-based diet. Features include:Insights from the luminaries behind the film—Dr. Neal Barnard, Dr. John McDougall, The Engine 2 Diet author Rip Esselstyn, and many othersSuccess stories from converts to plant-based eating—like San’Dera Prude, who no longer needs to medicate her diabetes, has lost weight, and feels great!The many benefits of a whole-foods, plant-based diet—for you, for animals and the environment, and for our futureA helpful primer on crafting a healthy diet rich in unprocessed fruits, vegetables, legumes, and whole grains, including tips on transitioning and essential kitchen tools125 recipes from 25 champions of plant-based dining—from Blueberry Oat Breakfast Muffins and Sunny Orange Yam Bisque to Garlic Rosemary Polenta and Raspberry-Pear Crisp—delicious, healthy, and for every meal, every day."

                    "If you've read any other vegan book in your life you won't learn anything new here. It's rehash. It's good information, but rehash to seasoned vegans nonetheless.And, I really hate to say this, but I actually think Forks Over Knives might ultimately turn more people off than create new converts. Don't get me wrong. I agree with what they are saying, and their philosophy on how to live is in line with what most of us vegans believe in. But what this book recommends is an extreme form of the lifestyle that even vegans like myself might find hard to transition into (let alone omnivores!). No oil, really? Not even a little olive oil? This book is promoting a raw vegan diet with very little wiggle room. Not that there's anything wrong with that, but a book geared towards the general public shouldn't expect people to jump right into this kind of veganism. Speaking for myself, the transition was much easier when I learned to bake vegan and create meals that reminded me of old favorites. And not worry about oil. Most of the general public finds veganism restrictive enough without all of these other no-no's thrown in!I haven't checked out all of the recipes yet (which seem to take up about 3/4 of the book) but I'm sure they're great - for people who are already vegan. Omnis, on the other hand, I doubt it. ",
                    "This book is the companion book for the film: Forks Over Knives, it works fine as a standalone book. The film is specifically mentioned in a paragraph at the end of the book and it's clear from the beginning of the book that a documentary film exists. I haven’t seen the film yet, but I do want to see it. I knew about the film long before I knew about this book.This is an excellent mish mash of various people’s stories of how they came to eat a plant based diet, which I think is very helpful for newbies. It definitely concentrates on health (no fat added, whole food based, plant eating style), but also has sections on why people would want to eat plants and avoid eating animals for animal rights/animal suffering and environmental reasons too. Then, most of the book is the last section, which is all recipes, 125 of them, also from a bunch of different people, and they come with little blurbs about them, which always makes for an enjoyable read.The recipes are all “healthy” vegan and most of them look delicious to me.The Yamadillas and Acorn Squash Soup look particularly enticing, along with the MVP (Most Valuable Pesto) Stuffed Mushrooms, the Sensational Herbed Bread, the Raise-The-Roof Sweet Potato-Vegetable Lasagna, the Wild Rice Stuffed Squash, the Creamy Noodle Casserole, and the Layered Tex-Mex Lasanga, Eggplant Pecan Pesto, Cream of Broccoli Deluxe Soup, Hearty Minestrone Soup, Oatmeal with Fruit, Cinnamon-Raisin Oatmeal, Broiled New Potato Puffs, Red Potatoes with Kale, and some desserts: Banana Ice Cream, Lime Mousse, and the Instant Chocolate Pudding. I’ll probably keep this cookbook for reference as one of my cookbooks handy in the kitchen. The recipes look easy to make (and clean up usually looks easy too, especially the ones sans food processor/blender), which is a huge plus for me.This is an excellent book (and I’ve heard an excellent movie) for new vegans or people open to a plant based diet, especially if their main motivation is their health.",
                    "Dr. Caldwell B. Esselstyn Jr. takes the credit for pioneering the movement to embrace a vegan diet of whole, plant-based foods in the mid-2000s. I rather think that the real credit should go to the Moosewood collective (especially Mollie Katzen) and its delicious Moosewood Restaurant cookbook series, the first of which, The Moosewood Cookbook: Recipes from Moosewood Restaurant, Ithaca, New York, first appeared in 1977. (In fairness, Katzen and crew did allow dairy products and eggs.)That said, let’s cut to the real point: How good is Forks Over Knives: The Plant-Based Way to Health? Well, for those late to the game, the book provides scientific evidence that a vegan lifestyle makes you slimmer and much healthier. It also provides some recipes that even meat-and-potatoes kind of men would appreciate. (Just don’t announce that it’s vegan, and they’ll just think it’s delicious stuff! And, whatever you do, don’t advertise recipe names like Joey’s Lifesaving Sweet Potato Chips, Nutrient-Rich Smoky Black Bean Soup or Hearty Dal Soup. That will just scare them off before they give the dish a chance.)While not as good as the Moosewood Restaurant recipes or my new favorite, Good and Cheap, Forks Over Knives: The Plant-Based Way to Health is definitely worth a gander. I’m glad that Amazon Kindle Daily Deal brought it to my attention."

                    " THIS IS ONE OCCASION IN WHICH THE MOVIE IS BETTER THAN THE BOOK!!! PLEASE WATCH IT!! The book is pretty good for recipes but it basically is just a summary of the movie. The movie, on the other hand, was totally mind blowing. I am a registered nurse and I see first-hand what obesity &amp, poor diet do to people.  I have been a lacto-ovo vegetarian for 15 years but started to eat seafood on occasion because of convenience. Anyway, I started to see myself suddenly gain weight &amp, thought it was just peri-menopausal. As a result, I started to eat more seafood &amp, dairy to increase my protein as a modified low carb diet. I lost a little weight but my energy level was very low. Earlier this year, I developed Shingles. I thought, How can this be? I'm a healthy person who is extremely active! I have the normal amount of stress but I don't sleep &amp, again, I attributed that to hormones. The Shingles were extremely painful &amp, after they went away, the pain remained despite any sort of medication.  I watched this movie on a whim &amp, it really made an impression on me. Who would have thought high protein was so dangerous? I always thought that maybe those high protein diets would cause renal damage, but many people I know have lost weight without their kidney function being affected but now I worry about problems they will have later in life. While thinking of the long term, I decided that for me, altering my diet is so much more preferable than to take medications &amp, then have to take more meds to alleviate the side effects. Remember, I'm a nurse. I know this to be true. I decided to try this diet for a month &amp, see how I would feel. I cut out all processed foods, all dairy, &amp, all seafood. Within a week, I was amazed at how wonderful I felt! I had tremendous amounts of energy, my clothes were getting looser, and best of all, my Shingles pain disappeared!! Incredible!! I decided to continue the diet for even longer! A month into it, I got my cholesterol checked &amp, it was the lowest it has ever been IN MY LIFE!! But the most amazing thing was that we had 3 parties over the next month &amp, I cheated by eating a small amount of processed food, a piece of cake, some chips, a brownie. And wouldn't you know it, I felt like garbage the very next day. My face was swollen, my Shingles pain came back, &amp, I was definitely more tired. And this happened on 3 different occasions, like clockwork! It seems the stuff that comes in boxes &amp, bags with all those crazy ingredients are what are so dangerous to us. Our bodies must go into some sort of inflammatory mode to figure out how to rid ourselves of this stuff. Again, it's truly amazing! One other thing is that I've been having my periods every 20 days for years (I know, to much information). It is not fun to go through that so often. Well, since I've started this diet, it went right to 27 days. We really don't realize that the food we eat has so many immediate consequences.  It is true that in this society, eating this way can be a difficult. I went to a birthday dinner for a relative at a steakhouse (I ate before I went out) and decided I would eat some broccoli so I wouldn't stand out. This broccoli was loaded with butter! I looked at the menu &amp, there was absolutely nothing on it without some sort of animal product on it. It's really awful.  The people in this movie who drastically changed their diet were on death's door but are still alive over 20 years later. If you are relatively healthy, you may be able to lower the amount of processed foods &amp, animal products that you eat a little at a time, but I'm telling you you will feel the difference. Eat things as close to their natural state as possible. Eating this way is definitely challenging &amp, you need to learn to cook a whole new way with new ingredients but you can really come up with some yummy stuff!  I really hope this catches on because people are the fattest &amp, unhealthiest they have ever been. Breaks my heart especially to see children this way. I bought the video to show all the other nurses I work with and EVERY SINGLE NURSE who has seen it was deeply impressed &amp, they are all learning to cook vegan meals &amp, getting their spouses involved. If people educated in science &amp, health practices are impressed, you should take it seriously too!",
                    "So much controversy over this book...Jones and I saw the movie on the recommendation of a friend. We thought it was worth trying, mainly because we have become aware over the years of how adulterated our food supply has become and how drastically our food choices affect how we feel. For years we have slowly been moving in this direction...away from processed crap foods, sugar, fried foods, etc and towards clean, organic foods. Our goals have been an improved quality of life and management of Jones' Type I diabetes (and hopefully avoidance of some of the life-shortening consequences of that disease).For many years, I have felt like one of the canaries in the coal mine. I have multiple food allergies and chemical sensitivities. As time has gone on and our food supply has been more and more drastically manipulated, I have had to work harder and harder to keep my diet clean and have been forced to drop more and more options from my diet in order to avoid feeling ill. After we saw the Forks Over Knives documentary, we decided that we would try this way of eating for 90 days starting January 1, 2013. We are now in week 8 and although we are still keeping an open mind and reserving the option to go back to our old way of eating, I can not imagine ever going back. Within days of taking on this challenge, we started noticing improvements to our health. Problems that Jones has had for 25+ years have improved drastically to the point of near eradication (chronic sinus infections, SERIOUS digestive problems, sleep issues). These are conditions for which he has visited multiple doctors, including specialists, time and time and time again, with no relief. He is using HALF the insulin that he used before. I am sleeping better, have had only one headache in 8 weeks, do not get ill after eating, and do not get hit with a daily tidal wave of exhaustion in late afternoon.We have both lost about 10 pounds, our skin is glowing, energy levels and mental clarity are WAY up. It's true, the book is not as good as the movie. But it is a wonderful tool if you want to give this way of life a shot. The recipes are easy and truly delicious. We eat as much as we want and are never hungry. Our bodies seem to be more satisfied because we do not crave foods the way we always did before. We also bought the Forks Over Knives cookbook and we switch back and forth daily. We will continue to monitor our health and make changes if needed, but we hope to keep eating this way permanently. We are looking forward to J's next endocrinologist visit so we can check improvements to his cholesterol levels, etc. His doctor has been pressuring him to go on statin meds for years and we're hoping to finally put that argument to rest. Neither of us is on a single medication (other than insulin for J's diabetes) and we plan to do everything in our power to keep it that way.I'm a dyed-in-the-wool skeptic. I'm a believer in Forks Over Knives, but only because I tried it and am experiencing the evidence first hand. Oh, and I put challenge in quotation marks up there in the third paragraph because it really isn't all that challenging. It's actually really easy...we're just conditioned to eat the way we eat in this country and most people think it is insane to consider giving up meat and dairy. Get over that mental hurdle and a whole new world opens up.",
                    "Bullet Review:I watched the documentary, I thought it was brilliant. I read this, I think I am brilliant.Where is the science? Where is the bibliography, the facts, more than just two scientists' opinion about this way of life? (And MacDougall - really? The dude profits off his program!) This felt like having Jehovah's Witnesses or Mormons coming to my door telling me how wonderful their life is and how if I JUST accepted their elixir, all my cures would go away. Or those people JP Sears jokes about selling essential oils that cure anything. I like the idea of moving more towards plants, less heavy on meat and dairy, but DAYUM, again, if these guys don't sound like they are selling you a bridge on Mars!As for the recipes - one of them is for oatmeal. OATMEAL PEOPLE. Sure, some of them are great, but for a companion book for the movie, a good 2/3 of the book is recipes!Lame, unless you need some new recipes to spice up your diet.Full Review:Forks Over Knives was a fascinating documentary I caught on Netflix exploring the American diet, heavy on animal protein and dairy and how it affects health. It also shows the benefits of eating more plants on that diet - weight loss, heart health, etc.Typically, the book is WAY better than the movie - but in this case, the exact opposite is true. Where the movie is packed full of science, the book is packed full of anecdotes of different people's experiences going (essentially) vegetarian/vegan and like 3 scientists who all are heavily invested in the plant-based movement anyway (McDougall for instance promotes his McDougall Program, sells food and 10-day treatment plans in Santa Clara, CA). These people are the same people who like to say Big corporations are making money off of making you fat - well, hard to not think that these people are making money off of making you thin!It's sad because the fact is, eating too much meat and dairy isn't good for you. A balanced diet is modest protein (NOTE: not necessarily meat!) and fats with hearty servings of fruits and veggies.While this program isn't as arduous as Joel Fuhrman's Eat to Live diet of 1lb of raw vegetables and 1lb of cooked, omitting all oils from your diet is probably going to drive you insane. (Really, olive oil is a naughty, naughty, bad, bad thing now?) And the recipes that make up a good 2/3rds of the book aren't the most ground-breaking - I think most people can figure out oatmeal and fruit smoothies!Unless you are in desperate need of recipes or have never heard of a plant-based diet ever, I don't think most people would find much use in this. It's supremely basic, relying way more on anecdotes and biographies for random people than science. (And yes, I do realize that an anecdote is a type of evidence - but let's not forget, it is ONE piece of evidence out of a whole series of other data points.) I love the idea of eating more plant-based, but this book did not make me more motivated to join the plant-based movement. If anything, it made me think that the plant-based movement was way more woo woo than I know it to be."

                    "This book has gotten me excited about cooking again. After a hot summer, reluctant to even enter the kitchen, cooler weather along with a re-awakened appetite has hit with a vengeance. My desire to get busy preparing warm stews, spicy curries and delicious dumplings was instantly ignited as I paged through the recipes in Terry Hope Romero’s new book, Vegan Eats World: 300 International Recipes for Savoring the Planet.The book has a hard cover and is similar in size, layout and feel to Veganomicon: The Ultimate Vegan Cookbook. The writing style and instructions are straightforward and clear. The photos are beautiful, the food is set off nicely by rustic backgrounds and I’m definitely tempted to try a few things that normally wouldn’t appeal to me just from looking at the photos. There are many things I like about Vegan Eats World. I’m happy that in some recipes, for harder to find ingredients, she gives a replacement option. There are several designations that make sorting through the over 300 recipes easier. Symbols indicate one or more of the following, quick preparation (under 45 minutes), longer cooking time (mainly inactive), cheaper ingredients, good beginner recipes, low fat, gluten free, and soy free recipes.In part one, titled Kitchen Cartography, the section describing regional ingredients was the most interesting to me. Where I live in Ontario, sumac trees grow everywhere so I was excited to learn about sumac powder and za’atar which are middle eastern spices. Other intriguing sounding ingredients I look forward to trying are Chinese Black Vinegar, Thai Golden Mountain Sauce and Gochuchang, a “sweet, spicy and tangy” Korean red chili paste. A trip to the Asian market is always a fun experience and it’s helpful to know what to pair these ingredients with.Also included in this section are commonly used ingredients in vegan cooking that you can find in most grocery or natural food stores. A primer on cooking equipment, cooking techniques, descriptions and some adorable drawings for dicing and slicing veggies and shopping lists for ethnic markets are useful sections for less experienced cooks.You will need access to ethnic markets for some ingredients. This author has already written a cookbook focused on Latin cuisine, a few are included here but this book mainly showcases recipes from Asia, Africa, India, the Middle East and the Mediterranean. A well stocked pantry will be useful if you plan on using this book extensively ( I certainly do!). I was thrilled to see a chapter called Dumplings, Breads and Pancakes. Pot-stickers are a particular favourite of mine and I’ve always wanted to take the time to make vegan versions of these plump, savoury, snacks.I began listing recipes that caught my attention but there are so many I won’t list them all. Here’s a small sampling of what you’re in store for!Seitan Coriander CutletsCilantro ChutneyCoconut Chile RelishThai Shredded Mango SaladCoconut Kale Summer Rolls with Peanut SauceNinja Carrot Ginger DressingGarlicky Potato DipCreamy Walnut Red Pepper SpreadChile Potato Rolls in Homemade Paratha BreadSweet and Savory Jackfruit Carnitas TacosGinger Tomato ChickpeasCoconut Black-Eyed Pea CurryTofu and Potato Adobo StewSpicy Saucy Soft Tofu (Ma-Po Tofu)Eggplant Shakshuka with Green Tahini SauceDeluxe Tofu Vegetable MafeGarlic Chive Seitan PotstickersShanghai Kale Dumplings in Sesame SauceAfghan Pumpkin Ravioli with Spicy Tomato SauceSpinach Coriander RotiCan you say yum?So far, I’ve managed to prepare two dishes, Savory Baked Tofu which was easy and delicious and the Flying Massaman Curry, also very good and even better the next day.This is not the book you would grab for a hurried weeknight supper unless you have a very well stocked pantry. I’d definitely recommended it for anyone interested in international cuisine, for plant based eaters who are looking to explore new flavours and people who like to entertain. I look forward to taking my time exploring Vegan Eats World for a long time to come. 4.5 Stars. Thank you to De Capo Lifelong press for providing an ARC. ",
                    "March 24, 2014I am recycling this review because I adore this cookbook. It's been a couple years since I started with it, and it is consistently fabulous: tasty, pretty, simple to follow. I have too many favorites to choose just a couple, and each time I try something it becomes a new favorite. I am amazed at its depth, now, after a couple years. There is always something new to thrill me.Make yourself Preserved Lemons, folks. What a game-changer!-------------------------Dec 15, 2012So, I am not a new vegan, nor is this my first encounter with the extraordinary skills of Ms. Romero. But this is one of the most exciting and completely Braveheart recipe collections I have ever seen. And Romero never left Queens! How is it possible?Romero reimagines cuisines of the world from a vegan viewpoint, something I had almost thought impossible. But she captures the flavor, color, and sense of the original with flair and originality and for the first time I have been able to wholeheartedly enjoy the world’s diverse bounty.I was able to enjoy Pumpkin Kibbe even though I did not have a food processor to grind the pumpkin and bulgur together. I used a 100-year-old old-fashioned hand-crank meat grinder and the result was sublime. I especially enjoyed the Yogurt Cashew sauce, and the recommended very hot harissa chile paste that accompanied the recipe. Both added immeasurably to the authentic taste.One thing I was familiar with in years gone by were Chinese BBQ Char Siu steamed “bao” and I was thrilled to be able to recreate the wondrous experience of eating them again. The recipe is flawless in terms of taste, though I can’t imagine any Chinese person using several pans to prepare the filling. The cornstarch dissolved in water can be stirred into the roasted seitan hot from the oven.I get wild cravings for good Ma-Po Tofu and Romero has included a brilliant recipe that works beautifully. I sprinkle on a few toasted Sichuan peppercorns for garnish because its distinct aroma makes the dish taste and smell authentic. I used a new-to-me tofu made from besan, or chick-pea flour. The recipe can be found in Burma: Rivers of Flavor by Naomi Duguid. Romero's Thai dishes are superb as well. The famous Tom Yum soup does not miss it's shrimp and the Grilled Seitan Noodle Salad made me feel quite as though I had just spent the day lounging seaside in the sun. A bottle of organic lime juice does wonders in making the dishes taste authentic.Romero reprised a few of the indipensable Latin dishes she introduced to us in Viva Vegan!: 200 Authentic and Fabulous Recipes for Latin Food Lovers but that book is filled with other wonders you won't want to miss. It is worth it's weight in gold for finding a way to make meat in Latin recipes totally irrelevant and it has recipes North Americans might find closer to home.Romero has done aspiring vegans a huge service by providing recipes from around the world. She has added diversity and color, flavor and interest to our menu and these dishes can be served with panache and joy to those curious onlookers to a vegan lifestyle. ",
                    "This book has many good features (such as introducing many ingredients to many new readers, gorgeous photography, having food ideas from around the world etc), but it leaves me a bit uncertain and disturbed.Some things can't be made vegan and still be called the same thing than their inspiration was. Imagine vegan thanksgiving turkey, vegan lamb, or vegan chicken something? Exactly. (Fine, call it tofu something or a TVP larb but it's not the real thing. )I would have given this 4 stars (and I hate rating cookbooks and biographies), but two three things annoyed me enough to get it to 3 instead, the abundance of seitan anywhere (while this book had also a great idea of having a lot of gluten free alternatives. Good luck finding a gluten free seitan!), the font used for the recipes - and most importantly: while you bothered to take the effort to introduce all the exotic ingredients including teff, why on earth would you give an injera recipe that doesn't use teff? Injera made without teff is crepes or blinis, please don't call it injera.",
                    "Wow. I had the opportunity to be a cookbook tester for this book when it was still in it's incomplete stage, meaning that I gave feedback to the author for each of the recipes that I tested. And I tested a lot. About 34 recipes in all to be exact. In this book, Terry has created a lush world with vegan versions of food from all over the planet. Like Latino cuisine? As with her first solo cookbook project, you'll find some great dishes. Interested in the culinary traditions of Japan, China, Korea, India, the Philippines, Ethiopia, Lebanon or the Mediterranean (and of course beyond all these limits)? Then you'll want to check out these recipes. From traditional breads, savory entrees, and fantastic soups to mind blowing desserts, sauces, and noodle dishes, there is so much to experiment with, so much to enjoy. If you like vegan food, you'll love this book."

                    "(ARC copy generously provided by NetGalley) Oh, Terry Hope Romero, what you do to me. I'm sitting here, looking through Vegan Eats World, and all I want to do is drop everything and run out to buy things like chickpea flour and pomegranate molasses and any number of international condiments so I can try every single recipe in this amazing cookbook.I began making notes on recipes I wanted to mention in my review and halfway through the book I was at 58 recipes, probably 85% of what I'd seen thus far. And those ones I didn't list were excluded simply because of the perceived challenges of getting all the ingredients. I mean, listen to these: Sweet Autumn Toasted Pita and Kale Salad, Beer-Bathed Seitan Stew and Oven Pommes Frites, French Farmhouse Asparagus Bisque, Chipotle Tofu Cemita Sandwiches, feta cheese made from cashews. Cashews! Cashews figure prominently in vegan cookbooks as vehicles for creaminess and texture, but who'd have thunk of cashews subbing for feta cheese? Genius! I just cracked open the ARC copy today so I haven't had a chance to try out any of these recipes, but they're written clearly, and Romero gives both suggestions on where to purchase hard-to-find ingredients as well as substitution ideas, making each recipe even more user-friendly.I have Veganomicon and I have Viva Vegan! both of which are Romero titles, and both of which are staples in my kitchen. Although I'm reviewing an ARC copy, there's no doubt I'll add this one to my home library as well. Meanwhile, I'm loading my digital copy onto my NOOK and am heading out within the next couple days to pick up ingredients for some of these yummy recipes. I can't wait!!",
                    "Oh.My.God!! This has become one of my all-time favorite cookbooks. My fingers are itching to actually try out the recipes. The only reason I am posting before trying the recipes is that I won this as an early birthday present from the Vegan Cookbooks group, and I wanted to post before the publication date of October 30. It arrived on the 23rd. I have been carting it around with me since then, showing it off to friends. I think the very first recipe I will try is the Ethiopian Chocolate Flourless Torte (p.340), which I hope to make soon to celebrate my past birthday. (If I don't make my own birthday cake, I don't get a homemade one-might get a store-bought one if I am lucky.) I am not one who usually likes cakes so much...they are okay with ice cream (dairy-free, of course!) I much prefer tortes and pie. And I ADORE chocolate!! I am curious about the smoky berbere spice that the Ethiopian Torte contains. Sounds delicious! I may have to eat the whole thing myself though--I don't have very many food-adventurous friends! (May not be a bad thing! ,-D )I really appreciated the way the cookbook was laid out. Contents were listed at the very beginning of the book, with recipes listed as they appear in the book. Also, at the back of the book, the author has listed recipes by icons: Beginner Cooking, Gluten Free, Lower Fat, On a Budget, Quick and Easy, Sit Back and Simmer, and Soy Free, making it easier to find a particular type of recipe. This is something that I have never seen in a cookbook before, although this is the first I have read by Ms. Romero. Also at the back of the book she listed several menu suggestions, including some specifically for parties (I may just have to host a International Super Bowl Party this year!) Others I may have to try are: Ethiopian Mesob Not to Be Missed, Pumpkin Kibbe Surprise Lunch, Homestyle Chinese Takeout Menu, Thali Up! (Mix'n'Match Indian and Sri Lankan Curries), and especially appropriate this time of year:Indian Thanksgiving. Another feature of the cookbook I really enjoyed was the Kitchen Cartography, where she goes into all the nuts and bolts of cooking: from how to cook efficiently (laying every thing out, how to chop, dice, peel garlic etc.), to what the different ingredients are, to generic shopping lists for different ethnicities, to kitchen equipment. I know how to cook, I mostly enjoy baking more, so the how-to section was helpful to me. I've never been a fan of tofu (when people find out I'm vegetarian, they often remark that they couldn't do tofu, and are surprised when I say I don't like it either!) I guess to be more accurate, I don't like the texture of fried tofu that I've gotten in Chinese and Thai restaurants. Other than that, I have nothing against tofu per se. I HAVE enjoyed seitan dishes in restaurants, and am looking forward to try to make seitan myself at home following her directions.There are very few recipes in this book that don't appeal to me. I don't like savory ingredients mixed with sweet(so I am not a fan of chutney and BBQ or anything with ketchup), and I didn't find many of those in this book. There are too many that I would probably like to list, but a sampling of the ones I most would like to try are:Spice Blends: Sichuan 5-Spice Powder, Toasted Rice Powder, Berbere Spice Blend, Spiced Buttery Oil (Niter Kebbeh)The Three Protein Amigos: Tofu, Seitan, &amp, Tempeh: Seitan Coriander Cutlets, 5-Spice Seitan, Lemon and Olive Chickpea Seitan, and I *may* be brave enough to try Savory Baked Tofu! The one time I tried tempeh, I didn't like it--I probably won't try the tempeh recipes.Pickles, Chutneys, and Saucier Sauces: Cilantro Chutney, Green Tahini Sauce, Toasted Hazelnut Crunch Dip (Dukka), Cashew Yogurt Sauce, Sour Dilly Cream, and I am especially eager to try the recipe for Cucumber Tzatziki!Salads, Spreads, and SandwichesThis section (except for the Soups section) may be my main go-to section. Some of the recipes I plan to try include: Coconut Kale Summer Rolls with Peanut Sauce, Greek Village Salad with Cashew Faux Feta (Horiatiki Salad), Bittersweet Apple and Endive Salad, Pistachio Date Quinoa Salad, Roasted Pumpkin Salad with Dukka, Garlicky Potato Dip (Skordalia), Sweet Autumn Toasted Pita and Kale Salad, Seitan Gyro Roll-UpsSoups This is the time of year I especially begin craving soups--when the weather turns chilly.Some I look forward to trying are: Zen Spinach Wonton Soup, Black Bean Soup with Roasted Poblanos (though I would leave off the recommended Pickled Red Onions), Masala Potato Soup, Like an Egyptian Lentil Soup, Sauerkraut Mushroom Soup (ShChi)Curries, Hearty Stews &amp, Beans: Pumpkin Coconut Curry, It's Easy Being Green Curry, Pumpkin Black Bean Posole StewDumplings, Breads, &amp, Pancakes: Potato Pierogi with Fried Onions, Afghan Pumpkin Ravioli with Spicy Tomato Sauce, Turkish Zucchini Pancakes (Mucver), Filo Samosas, Jamaican Curry Seitan PattiesAsian Noodles to Mediterranean Pasta: Cuury Noodle Soup with Oyster Mushrooms (Curry Laksa), Pad Kee Mao (Spicy Drunken Noodles), Takeout Stir-Fry Noodles with Mushrooms and Greens, Pad Thai with Avocado and Spicy Greens, Greek Eggplant Lasagna (Pastichio Vegani)Hearty Entrees: Gyro Roasted Seitan, This is Sparta! Spinach Pie, Moroccan Vegetable Filo Pie (Bisteeya), Ella's Buck Wild Stuffed Cabbage with Sunflower Cream Tomato Sauce, Fluffy Scrambled Chickpea Eggs with Shallots (But'echa),Jerk-Roasted Seitan StripsRobust Vegetable Entrees &amp, Sides:Roasted Eggplant Marsala, Lemon Garlic Potatoes, Yu-xiang Eggplant (Sichuan Spicy Eggplant), Luscious White Bean and Celery Root Puree Rice and Whole Grains: One-Pot Meals &amp, Supporting Roles This section includes basics of cooking rice, and some basic rice recipes. Some of the recipes that I'd like to try include: Steamed Sticky Rice (one of the basic recipes that she includes, but that I enjoy and have never tried to make), Lemony Dill Rice, White Rice and Black Beans, Island Brown Rice and Peas, Colombian Coconut Lentil RiceSweet Beginnings besides the Chocolate Torte mentioned above I'd like to try: Walnut Spice Sticky Cake, Pumpkin Churros (although I don't care much for fried food, these intrigue me!), Carrot Semolina Halva, Vanilla Coconut Sticky Rice with Mango, Italian Cashewcotta CheesecakeWhew! It might take me over a year to work my way through this! I look forward to the opportunity! Thanks again, Vegan Cookbook Group and Da Capo Press for this book!",

                    "This is my kind of book. Food fast, even though the 30 minutes or less often refers to prep time. I really appreciate the author’s attitude that recipes are guidelines and that she recommends flexibility while preparing food. I like the international flavor of the recipes. I like the introductions to each section and the blurbs at each recipe. Some good, general time saving tips are offered.I’m not fond of the frequency with which sugar is included as ingredients in the savory dishes. A glossary in the back would have been helpful. I know most “vegan” food terms by now but what are panko crumbs? Anyone? I’m sure some of you know, but I do not.

                    "Quick-Fix Vegan : Healthy Homestyle Meals in 30 Minutes or Less by Robin Robertson turns cooking vegan foods into something faster ,healthier and tastier than convenience foods using no animal products. She's also the author of Quick Fix Vegetarian.My family are not vegans, but we try to eat a vegan menu a few days every week. We've realized a lot of the reason we eat meat is because it's convenient and easy. It's a health choice for my family.So I have a lot of vegan cookbooks. My test for a good vegan cookbook is to see if my cheese loving, bacon adoring daughter likes the meals enough that she doesn't make herself a sandwich to supplement the meal.One of the big things that goes over consistently well is meals that don't have meat substitutes, the flavor and texture come from fresh ingredients without trying to simulate meat. A lot of vegan cookbooks tend to take the path of substituting vegan meat alternatives in traditional recipes.This one has lots of recipes that use good ingredients, frequently canned or frozen for convenience rather than using lots of those substitutes.The tomato tortilla soup for example. A wonderful chili inspired soup with lots of tomatoes, beans, corn, and flavor that comes from the chili powder and cumin.The Korean hot pot is a recipe I'm looking forward to trying. It does call for tofu, but also a lot of good vegetables and looks to be a cold-weather favorite.Today we've gotten just huge amounts of snow, and I adapted the recipe for stovetop fruit crisp. The recipe originally calls for peaches, a mix of strawberries and cherries was perfect for the weather. While the top didn't crisp up as much as baked crisps, it was good.There are also some recipes in here that look great for warmer weather. Chesapeake chickpea sandwiches uses chickpeas and sea veggies in place of crab for patties. The salty-tart rainbow rotini salad has dried cranberries for bursts of sweet and tart.This book doesn't have lots of color photos. It does have a lot of great recipes that are well explained, and it's going to be my go-to cookbook for our vegan meals for a while, especially for the soups and desserts. Because everything is quick to make, on nights we have a big pot of soup, I can see making a fresh dessert as well for a special treat.I received a complimentary copy of the book to review on my craft blog- Don't Eat the Paste. My reviews are always my honest opinion",
                    "This is my favorite Robin Robertson cookbook yet. We loved the Last-Minute Laksa and Mediterranean Vegetable Packets.For the record, some of the meals can't really be gotten on the table (at least, not by me) in 30 minutes, but I still give the recipes credit for being relatively streamlined. They are certainly delicious.",
                    "The virtues: the recipes have a small number of ingredients and are fairly quick to prepare (though 30 minutes from start to table is pushing it I think).Drawbacks: Not particularly flavourful. The basic ingredients show potential, but in the handful of recipes I made there just wasn't enough attention paid to seasoning. I had to add things to all the recipes I tried to make them tasty. But as a starting point the recipes at least get you going in the right direction. The Zucchini Frittata made from tofu instead of eggs was quite good (once I added spices and hot sauce!). The tofu mixture, once baked, really was quite egg like and you could do a lot of experimenting with filling. Conclusion: A good book if you're into experimentation. You would need to take these recipes as a basic starting point and dress them up significantly.",
                    "Another winner - I cook a ton from this cookbook. I find many recipes I can put together from things in the pantry or the freezer already which is great. The recipes also lend themselves readily to substitution - I've been able to work around ingredients I don't have for a simple solution. The recipes are really tasty and they ARE truly quick, which is of huge value to me. I'm slowly working through nearly all the recipes in this book - we've come around to several more than once already. "

                    "This a great basic cookbook! My only issue is whether I need this giant tome in ADDITION to Deborah Madison's Vegetarian Cooking for Everyone. There's a lot of overlap, and the answer is probably no. I prefer Deborah Madison's format and style slightly, but the books are similar in many ways. The clincher: I already own Deborah Madison's book.Still, I could totally see living out of this book, much as I already do with Deborah Madison. This is a great resource for old and new vegetarians alike, or for meat eaters who eat vegetarian sometimes (which is to say, everyone). If you like this better than Vegetarian Cooking for Everyone, I won't blame you.I have limited cookbook real estate - my cookbook corner is already precariously piled high. So even though this is a more useful tome than Patricia Well's Vegetable Harvest, I might buy the latter instead of this one, because it's less basic and more fancy, and thus fits in a slightly different niche."

                    "BEST. COOKBOOK. EVER. I could get rid of every other cookbook I have. I've had this one for ten years and refer to it often. I rarely pull out any of the other cookbooks I have. This guy is simple, honest, casual and creative. No crazy ingredients you can't find, no recipes that tie you to the kitchen for hours. Just simple recipes for real people using real food. And he offers TONS of variations on his recipes, and coaches you how to substitute other ingredients if you have to. Lots of vegan options too. LOVE this book. If my house was burning and I could bring ten items, this would be one of them!! :)",
                    "This is an amazingly comprehensive book! My two favorite things about it are: 1)The TRUE simplicity of many of the recipes. Just a handful of ingredients you have on hand and can throw together for something healthy and tasty.2) Many of the recipes can easily be converted to vegan. He even gives variations of the main recipe that include vegan choices.This book has something for everyone. It's an excellent reference manual for much more than recipes. It would be a fantastic gift for someone who doesn't know much about basic cooking techniques. The illustrations and instructions for these techniques are admirable.",
                    "This is one of the most useful cookbooks on my shelf. I use it several times a week and have not yet made anything that I didn't like. It has helped me try new foods with confidence.",
                    "Okay, I'm only through the first 100 pages of this nearly 1,000 page cookbook, and I'm sold. I think this is the Laurel's Kitchen for the 21st century, and will proudly sit on my bookshelf next to it. Bittman's writing is in an easy, conversational, been there-done that level that doesn't make you feel either lost if you've never cooked anything before or talked down to if you've been a cook (or a vegetarian) for years. Recipes are coded for Fast, Make Ahead or Vegan and each basic recipe has several variations to suit anyone's particular flavor, and most ingredients are those you are familiar with if you've spoken vegetarian before. I've only tried one recipe in the book so far (cornbread--I know, not an exclusively vegetarian cookbook food) and it turned out to be the best I've ever made before.This is a cookbook that only a fellow home chef could pick out for another. There are plenty of cookbooks that say vegetarian in the title or description, but this one lives up to it's name with good basic cookery that just happens to be vegetarian.Thanks Nancy...and I suppose Drew too, but let's be honest about who suggested giving me this as a gift...",
                    "With apologies to Mr. Bittman, I tend to enter any consideration of his recipes with a mistrustful squint in my eye. Who of us has tried to pry off a sticky towel from a mirthless lump of bread we were assured of being the ultimate no-knead bread has felt otherwise for at least a moment? You might have even been somewhat underwhelmed by the how to cook everything books you've encountered before. This book, however, is wonderful. Chock filled with useful recipes for the beginning OR advanced vegan/vegetarian, within a couple of days from the library, I ordered a copy for my house. Mr. Bittman, I promise I might even try that bready mess again sometime.",
                    "This is an interesting cookbook. Mark Bittman, who has created other cookbooks, takes a shot at a vegetarian cookbook. One nice wrinkle--he shows Vegans how they can adapt some of these recipes to their needs. He begins by noting that (Page ix) Increasingly, Americans are becoming `flexitarians,' a recently invented word that describes both vegetarians who aren't that strict and meat-eaters who are striving for a more health conscious, planet friendly diet. He follows up by noting, simply, that (Page x): A diet that is high in vegetables, fruits, whole grains, and legumes is a healthier diet than one that isn't. Some nice features aside from the recipes: a section on key ingredients that one needs in the kitchen, required equipment for cooking, various kitchen techniques (how to sharpen knives, different ways of cutting with knives, measuring, different methods of cooking (e.g., steaming, sautéing, braising, etc.). Then, on to recipes. Recipes are grouped in the following categories: salads, soups, eggs, dairy, and cheese, produce (vegetables and fruits), pasta, noodles, and dumplings, grains, legumes, tofu, veggie burgers, and other high-protein food, breads, pizzas, sandwiches, and wraps, sauces, condiments, herbs, and spices, desserts. Obviously, there are too many different categories to go into great detail in each. Following, a set of recopies that look interesting (and doable) to me. I hope to try some of these out in the near future (confession: I am not a vegetarian, but I am a flexitarian). Salads: Carrot salad with cumin. Nice look to it--carrots, orange juice, lemon juice, olive oil, pepper, and--most interesting to me--cumin. Pretty simple to make and it looks tasty. Soup: I recently made potato and leek soup using another cookbook. This one has a somewhat different recipe that looks worth trying out. One nice aspect of this cookbook well exemplified by this dish: Bittman provides alternatives variations. In this case, that includes how to make this into Vichyssoise, Vegan Vichyssoise, and Korean style potato and leek soup. Produce: Roasted or grilled asparagus. Very simple recipe, but I love asparagus, so any recipes are welcome at my home! Asparagus, olive oil (extra virgin), salt, and lemon wedges. What could be easier? Broccoli Roman style: Unlike George H. W. Bush, I love broccoli! Whether raw or cooked or done any other way! Pasta: Pasta with broccoli (my bias shows again, regarding broccoli). Legumes: Vegetarian chili con carne (depending for its power on hot chili). Burger: Spicy autumn vegetable burger. Key ingredients: Kale, cannellini, extra virgin olive oil, sweet potato, bread crumbs, cinnamon, nutmeg, pinch of cayenne). Sounds yummy to me! So, bottom line, a nice cookbook. The recipes tend to be pretty straightforward. If interested in more vegetarian eating, this would be one nice volume to explore. ",
                    "Everything? EVERYTHING!No luscious photographs, but useful illustrations of techniques. This is a reference work that assumes (quite rightly in our case) that you are prepared to make that little bit of effort and make your own tortellini, wonton skins, kombu dashi, chapatis - ooh and a recipe for dosas, luv'em, and even how to make cheese. But Bittman aims at those who are unfamiliar with basic cooking techniques too, with fine drawings that show what to do with a green pepper, or a tomato, for example. A little obvious perhaps, but invaluable when it comes to How to Deal with an Artichoke. This is the kind of cookbook that gives you confidence to experiment: the basic method is given and then suggestions for creative variations on a theme. This is perhaps what is essential for those of us who were brought up on a fairly traditional meat-and-two-veg diet, beyond dal I never had many ideas of what to do with legumes, or grains other than rice. And there is a whole section on salsas and dips and pickles to whizz up rapidly and add a bit of pizazz to the palate.I like his ethos. When writing of yoghourt: I want whole milk, I want active cultures, and I want no thickeners. (But use low-fat if you must) - he has an excellent section on bread making - What you don't want is a bread machine (too right you don't) - and takes away a lot of the mystique that surrounds yeast dough and bread making. As he says, you can produce very good bread straight away and get 90 per cent down the road to great bread in a season of bread making. The last 10 per cent is the hardest, and, except for a couple of great home bakers I know, few of us make it there. And admits that he has not. Lucky for me then, that I have a tame great bread maker here at home and sourdough permanently lurking in the fridge.There are plenty of ideas for the less ambitious or for those short of time, and there is a handy system that marks the recipes that are quick, that can be made ahead, that are vegan.The only slight disadvantage to this kind of extremely tasty home-cooked vegetarian food is that it spoils you for going out for a meal. The only kind of restaurant I've ever been to where I would really prefer the veggie choice is Indian: otherwise the non-meat alternatives are often bland and unappealing. Maybe pizza, and some pasta dishes at the Italian. We're not dogmatically vegetarian, we just avoid meat as much as possible (and much is possible). But most non-veggie restaurants here tend to just pay lip service to those who would rather not eat the flesh of dead animals, and offer a melee of over-cooked vegetables with cheese sauce from a packet over the top. Or you can have the salad, madame, we can serve it without the shredded ham. So then all that's left is tasteless iceberg and a bit of woolly tomato. But if we give in and have the meat or fish, then there's no incentive for the restaurants to improve the alternatives, is there? ",
                    "This book is useful not just for the recipes, but for the illustrations and instructions on how to chose, prepare and cook various types of vegetables. He addresses various staples of the vegetarian diet with brief introductions followed by recipes and tips. Non-vegetarians could find this book very useful, in expanding their fruit and vegetable repertoire as well as just adding to their stock recipes for common ingredients. Plus, not every recipe here is for a main dish, so many of his ideas would be useful in filling out a meatier menu.I enjoyed reading some of it straight through, skipping over ingredients I don't like and then used the handy and well-organized index to identify recipes I would cook from. Bittman shares some of personal preferences and suggestions along with page references, so when he suggests a variation on one recipe, he leads you conveniently to further instructions. I don't usually buy cookbooks, I just browse them and save the recipes I like. But this is a great blend of kitchen reference and menu-planning and I want it on my shelf permanently. It's going on my Christmas list, and it ought to go on the Worth A Try list of anyone who loves to, or is learning to cook."

                    "The best of river cottage yet, this book is a clear manifesto - to make us eat less meat and thus better meat and eat a lot more vegetables. This the book I have been waiting for as my food philosophy has evolved over the years and my reading has broadened. I will never be vegetarian but I am uncomfortable with eating meat from intense farming methods. As a result, we now only include meat in three of our meals a week, eat more fish and, essentially, make the fruit and veg from the garden and the market the centre of our meals.The recipes here and in the companion volume River Cottage Every Day are the most accurate of any of the River Cottage books and, although a lot of the dishes are what we would call winter dishes (we live in a warmer climate), there is enough selection there to make many glorious meals for the family incorporating so many flavours and textures that no one misses the meat. This book has real appeal in that, despite its uses of pulses etc, it avoids all the cliches and pitfalls of what I would call a cookbook for vegetarians. Tofu and nut cutlets anyone? Well, not here, Hugh is not simply substituting meat for some other simulacra but re-introducing vegetables to our table as the main constituent of the meal. If you really can't do without, simply use a little meat as a flavouring to the dishes herein, they'll still work and you'll be able to afford meat from animals that have been lovingly reared."

                    "Interesting vegetable cookbook that is written by a well known carnivore chef. His most famous cookbook to date being The River Cottage MEAT book (as far as I know).So even though all the recipes included are meatless, it didn't necessarily shout out vegetarian cookbook to me at first glance.What I did love about this cookbook aside from the many beautiful illustrations was the simplicity of the majority of the dishes while still sounding equally delicious and worthy of a main entree . There are more than two hundred vegetable-based recipes, including more than sixty vegan recipes with recipes such as Kale and Mushroom Lasagna, Herby, Peanutty, Noodly Salad, and Winter Stir-Fry with Chinese Five-Spice...…..  You’ll find handy weeknight one-pot meals, pure and simple raw dishes, and hearty salads as well as a chapter of meze and tapas dishes to mix and match, making this book an inspiring new source for committed vegetarians and any conscientious cook looking to expand their vegetable repertoire...…..Was delighted to pick up this kindle book for $1.99 and I know I will be trying out several of these tasty sounding recipes. ",
                    "This contains an excellent variety of vegetable dishes. I am a fan of Hugh's philosophy regarding food. It is not about becoming veggie or replacing meat products with something else. The question is why our mess revolve around a central 'meat' dish. Some of my favourite parts of a Sunday dinner are the vegetable dishes, not the meat. Why can't a beautiful cauliflower cheese take centre stage?A lot of recipes here reflect similar ones used in my house hold. We are not veggie but believe in using more locally sourced fruit, veg and meat. Ideally meat should be eaten less frequently but of higher quality than mass farmed meat. So it needs to be farmed sustainability and the animals eating what they are supposed to.. i.e. grass not g.m. soya feeds. This isn't cheap but is affordable if we make vegetables the main staple of our every day food.This book will help the novice learn the skills to help use vegetables in a more interesting manner. The recipes are very forgiving and one thing can be swapped for another. Frequently there are suggestions for variations, often based around season (cheaper to eat seasonally) to help people get going. There are good ideas to help the more experienced cook used veg more imaginatively. *edit* The book points out which are vegan and some have variations which are vegan.",
                    "Although I started out as a fan of Hughs and a enthusiast about this series and book, I have since changed my mind. I think this series is all about making money and ticking boxes and I think the TV show comes across as misguided and confusing. As a vegetarian I really dont appreciate Hugh's disrespectful treatment of dead animals and the jovial nature him and his staff treat the death of these animals. Hugh is trying to get vegetarians onside whilst still being an avid meat eater. He claims to want to show the world how wonderful vegetarian food can be and get people eating less meat but he states throughout the series that he cannot wait for however many weeks to pass so he can once again partake in the killing and eating of animals. Admittedly I have a bee in my bonnet about the whole thing and have stated my concerns on the river cottage facebook page. That being said this book is by far the best vegetarian cookbook I own. The recipes are easily altered to make them vegan and a lot of them are already vegan. The food is simple and tastes fantastic. My boyfriend and I have already used this book more than any other recipe book we own. So with gritted teeth I would recommend all of the veggies and vegans out there to buy this. I know some may not want to give him the money but I have always (until now) had quite a bit of respect for Hugh as he has always fought for better treatment of animals and shown people exactly how animals are killed for meat. If you can put your views aside I am sure you will find a book you dive into regularly and some of the dishes will become firm family favourites in your household. Soooo... buy it and dont watch the tv show because I wish I hadnt. ",

                    "About a month ago, I was having one of those days. I’d been booked for a job but my client was late delivering their material. I’d run out of coffee so I had to have tea for breakfast. Without my booked job to fill up my day I tried to do my own research but the words weren't flowing and the postmodernists were giving me the shits with their unnecessarily dense language (I do love a bit of pomo but it's so frigging hard to read sometimes). After an afternoon of unproductively staring at my computer my inner teenager emerged and I flopped on the couch, eating peanut butter from the jar and listlessly flipped through the channels, moaning at each progressively unappealing televisual choice (of course I had watched all of the DVDs I had and, although I had new ones waiting at the library to be picked up, didn't go because I was waiting for the job to arrive. Of course.) before settling the least boring of all of the boring choices, a show about cooking vegetables.However, I was pleasantly surprised. The show was the River Cottage Veg Everyday and it featured an appealing foppish gardening nerd enthusing about vegetables and his produce and cooking in an old-fashioned stove. It was really appealing! So, after eating Chinese takeaway (which was average, of course), I ordered the book that accompanies the TV series from the library and went to bed. This book is really good! Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall is not a vegetarian but thinks we eat too much meat. For him, meat should be a garnish or a side dish rather than the main event. He states:Call me power-crazed, but I'm trying to change your life here. The object of the exercise is to persuade you to eat more vegetables. Many more vegetables. And I hope to do so not by shouting from a soapbox, but through sheer temptation.And the recipes are tempting. There's a huge range of dishes here including salads, comfort foods, tapas dishes and storecupboard suppers. I was even inspired to buy asparagus, which is not something I would normally do. I made the veggie stock and am trying the asparagus risotto with chili oil tomorrow.The best thing I have made from the book so far, however, is the refried bean foldover. The topping is the refried beans, which is fine - cheap and easy and pretty tasty with the addition of fresh coriander and ground cumin. The flat breads, though, were a complete revelation. They were delicious! The dough uses a recipe that can also be topped and baked for pizzas but is rolled as thin as you can get it and then cooked in a very hot dry pan for about two minutes a side. My boyfriend didn't witness me make them and thought I'd bought them, which is a huge compliment given that my bread is usually a distant second to good store-bought bread. I can see the flatbread becoming a regular part of my everyday dinner rotation.I give this book four stars and is one of the few books that I simply must buy for myself after borrowing the library."

                    "So, I got my cookbook and took it home, and started to make the rejuvelac that night. The steps were very simple and each thing only takes a few minutes to do, but the whole process takes several days to complete. No matter. I got the fermented rejuvelac, and at first I was scared because it smelled like something rotten, even though it looked exactly like what the author described. My husband said it smelled exactly like something you would use to make cheese, but I was frightened I had gotten an invasive bacteria in my rejuvelac and it was ruined. But despite my doubt I decided to make the cheese and just...see. I forgot to soak the cashews and I had to add some of the drinkable variety of coconut milk (it's what I had on hand) to make the mixture blend, and I also forgot salt. first-time jitters. It smelled horrible when I poured it into the bowl, and I had mostly decided I wasn't going to try it, but I left it in the fridge for a couple days cause it was such a tragedy to waste the cashews. Maybe my husband would eat it. He good-naturedly picked up some wheat crackers to eat with our cheese, and when he took the cheese out of the fridge and I smelled it, it smelled exactly like cheese! I was astonished. It smelled just like I would expect cheese to smell. I was still reluctant to try it, but my husband got me a cracker with cheese -- the cheese mixture was a spreadable consistency like cream cheese -- and handed it to me. I sprinkled on some salt and put it in my mouth, still feeling positive that I probably ruined everything and now we would both die. It was so much like chevre. In fact, I think it makes a very satisfying substitute for chevre, and I can totally imagine baking up a loaf of french bread and sitting down with this cheese and sharing it with someone wonderful. So, I left out a couple of ingredients but it still came out tasting tart, a little lemony, with a creamy, creamy texture from the cashews.The yogurt was much easier to make, but I filled up the jar almost to the top and screwed the lid on when I set it on the counter, and the mixture pressurized the jar. I noticed that there was yogurt dripping down the side of the jar and I opened it over the sink, and the yogurt came burbling out. I think I lost about a fourth cup, so be smart and use two of the one quart size jars, and don't fill them up all the way.OK, now I'm off to make more cheese! Hooray!",
                    "During my transition from vegetarian to vegan, I got really involved in veganizing things. I love the appeal of taking something that normally requires dairy or eggs or meat and making a delicious vegan version. Cheesemaking was something that I had never tried when I did eat dairy, but I liked the challenge of making my own nut-based cheese. It all starts with rejuvelac, and I feel that this book misses the boat slightly on that. Yes, there is a recipe, but there is little guidance about it. Rejuvelac seems to be a very hit-or-miss thing, and when it goes wrong, it can go pretty horribly wrong. Most crucially, this book does not give direction as to when your rejuvelac is bad (and thus you shouldn't be using it!). I had a blissful first experience where the quinoa-based rejuvelac turned out perfectly, and I made a few cheeses using it. (My favorite was the brie recipe. It is also one of the easiest to make with the least chance of screwing it up.) When I tried making amaranth-based rejuvelac, it was horrible. It smelled like old vomit. My second batch of quinoa-based was not much better. If I had not known that proper rejuvelac wasn't vile, I may have just assumed this was how it was and made cheese that killed us all. I feel like a little more direction on rejuvelac is essential here because it's such a basic block.That said, some of the cheeses turned out great (the brie) and some were wastes of cashews. The air dried gouda was horrible. It never worked right, and eventually it ended up in the trash. I am sure that some of this is a problem on my end (temperature? air flow?), but there is little in this book to guide you, and even following everything down to the letter doesn't necessarily mean success. I don't know what the missing ingredient is. Luck?Sadly, cashews and other ingredients are not cheap, so my patience for trial and error is relatively low. I have mixed feelings overall on this book.",
                    "Well, I made a few of the recipes. Being gluten free, I made rejuvelac from rice. It never got lemony (tried it twice). I used it anyway to make a few cheese recipes. I had high hopes after reading reviews. Yeah, no. The sour cream from cashews, however, works well to make veggie dip. ",
                    "Many vegan cheese recipes I've made in the past have involved soaking and pureeing nuts which have resulted in a ricotta-like taste and consistency but the recipes in this book involve fermentation and aging which result in more complex flavors and textures. Upon eating the one-month aged gruyere, sps said, Whoa, I haven't had that flavor in 8 years! because it really did have the slightly sharp/sour taste of animal milk cheese. Though the whole process takes a few days, the instructions are easy to follow and the ingredients are fairly basic (except maybe for xantham gum). The cheddar wasn't very exciting and it tasted strongly of nutritional yeast but the gruyere was good enough to make me want to try more. It was creamy, tangy, and nutty. I learned making rejuvelac does not make me a hippie. "

                    "This is one of the hardest ratings I’ve ever assigned. I could have rated this from 5 to 2 stars. For me, for using it, I suspect 2 or 3 stars, for most people who have even the remotest interest in vegan cheese, I’d say 5 stars. Vegan cheeses are definitely improving, at least according to most palates. The cheeses created by this author, after a tremendous amount of work and experimentation, and passion and love, are probably amazing. I’ve never tasted any. I doubt that I’ll make many, though I’d love to try some. The author is local and does sometimes have events. I’d like to try some, though not all, of these cheeses. I like this author, a lot, as a person and as a chef. Her old vegan restaurant in my city, Now and Zen, was one of my very favorite restaurants, and I still mourn its loss, as do many of my friends, some of them omnivores.Anyway, this is an amazing book, it’s just not one that personally thrills me. I had to try for 6 ½ years to go fully vegan, and my difficulty was mostly because of craving cheese, most specifically sharp cheddar, and to a lesser extent, guyere, etc. cheeses. But after many years, I finally got over my need for any cheese. I’ve found a couple vegan cheeses I like, and occasionally eat, and I suspect the ones in this book are superior in every way to those. But, I’m not THAT interested anymore. I was intrigued by this book though, especially because of its author, and I can heartily recommend it to those interested.To see some photos of readers’ versions of these recipes, and to read some mini reviews and experiences with them, you can go to this thread http://www.goodreads.com/topic/show/1... in the Goodreads group Vegan Cooking &amp, Cookbooks group. I’ve gotten hungry for some of these cheeses just by reading and viewing the thread and its links.The author is very personable and I love her little stories about her children and life and her year of experimenting with vegan cheeses. She really, really worked at it, and from all reports I’ve heard, she succeeded. There is a short text blurb about the recipe on the top of every recipe page. Each of the full recipes (vs. just the ones for the basic cheeses) have nutritional information showing the numbers for calories, protein, fat, saturated fat, carbohydrate, sodium, calcium. Most of the recipes do look delicious, and I know this author is a fabulous cook, I’ve eaten many of her pre-vegan cheese recipes.There are some mouthwatering photos of some of the recipes and of the cheeses themselves. Some of the ingredients I find unappealing. I’m talking vegan yogurt and coconut oil, etc. ingredients that most will probably enjoy. I’m a picky eater and have a fairly long list of vegan foods I don’t like. That includes one in the cheddar cheese, the cheese I’d be most interested in trying. Ditto the guyere.One huge positive of this book is that while making many of these cheeses takes some time, most of them seem reasonably easy to make, a few really easy to make. I was surprised that most of the cheese recipes seemed doable. The full recipes, most it would help to have some experience in the kitchen.I can recommend this book to anyone who loves cheeses, especially vegans, anyone allergic to dairy, those who are lactose intolerant, and anyone avoiding animal based cheeses for any reason, and cookbook readers, especially those interested in making their own cheese.Contents:Foreword by Dixy MahyPreface: My Year of Vegan CheesesAcknowledgementsIntroductionChapter 1: Artisan and Aged CheesesChapter 2: Air-Dried CheesesChapter 3: Meltable CheesesChapter 4: Almost-Instant CheesesChapter 5: Other Dairy AlternativesChapter 6: Cheese Sauces and FondueChapter 7: First Courses and Small PlatesChapter 8: Entrées and Accompaniments Chapter 9: Sweet Cheese Dishes and DessertsGlossarySuppliersIndex About the AuthorI feel really, really guilty giving this book only 3 stars, even though I could have also given it 2, instead of 5 or at least 4 stars.

                    "Artisan Vegan Cheese takes a really revolutionary approach to vegan cheeses. Most of the recipes start with a culture and you actually ferment your cashew/ soy yogurt to produce a cheese.4 stars for the idea of the book and interesting reading.3 stars for how my cheeses came out.I made 4 different cheeses from the book using quinoa rejuvelac (easy!), a normal blender and agar powder:-Basic Cashew CheeseNot impressed. A fine spread but not worth the effort. -Smoked ProvoloneThis had a wonderful taste while it was hot. It never firmed up for me, but I still like the taste as a spread. It doesn't taste like cheese to me, but yummy. -BrieGreat texture, firmer than regular brie. I didn't use refined coconut oil (I had Trader Joe's coconut oil on hand), so it tastes like coconut but a nice smooth texture. A winner if I make it with refined coconut oil next time. Very rich.-Air-Dried CamembertMine tastes like a tart version of the above brie but with a less smooth and firm texture but still sliceable. Doesn't taste like cheese to me but a good, savory flavor. ",
                    "What an incredible adventure this book has been. For those who don't know, Miyoko is creator of Miyoko's Creamy - which is pretty much the gold standard in vegan cheese. That should be reason alone to check this out - and there's a lot to be learned here.Prior to diving into this cookbook, I'd never sprouted anything, never cultured anything, and definitely never made cheese - vegan or otherwise. It really opened my eyes to so many new culinary techniques and possibilities. If you do some google searching, you'll see there are plenty of recipes out there that seek to approximate cheese using a variety of thickeners, binders, flavorings, etc. And then there is another category that are actually cultured much like traditional cheese would be. Miyoko offers a little of both in her cookbook, but in my opinion - the real standouts are of the cultured variety.She's a big proponent of using something called Rejuvelac as the primary culturing agent. It's a liquid that you make from sprouted grains - which was a new experience from me. She says that you can use any grain to make the Rejuvelac, but I'd highly recommend wheat berries. I tried it with rice the first time and it didn't go so well. I'd also recommend a sprouting lid for a mason jar.My favorite cheeses from this book were the softer, spreadable ones - such as her Sharp Cheddar (pg 14). They're similar to the amazing Miyokos cheeses you might find at Whole Foods. I found the hard cheese recipes just weren't setting all that well for me. But as part of my vegan cheese exploration - I came across the incredible resources they have available at Cashewbert. And I did actually make some vegan Camembert - following a process very similar to traditional cheese making. It produces a vegan cheese with a true rind, and tastes very reminiscent of Brie or Camembert. Admittedly, I had some cheese connoisseur friends from Wisconsin try it, and it wasn't enough to make them converts. So maybe it's not fair to compare apples to apples, but as a vegan, I feel like this is about as close as you can get to the flavor complexity of traditional cheese. The Cashewbert is amazing with some jam and sourdough crackers.Bottom line - this book definitely requires an open mind and a sense of adventure. But if you have that, you'll amazed at all you can discover. And next thing you know, you have a whole new set of tricks in the kitchen. You won't just be making cheese - you'll be sprouting greens, making your own sauerkraut and culturing your own yogurt!"

                    "A bestselling author’s groundbreaking eating plan that challenges the notion that starch is unhealthyFrom Atkins to Dukan, the fear-mongering about carbs over the past few decades has reached a fever pitch; the mere mention of a starch-heavy food is enough to trigger a cavalcade of shame and longing.In The Starch Solution, bestselling diet doctor and board-certified internist John A. McDougall, MD, and his kitchen-savvy wife, Mary, turn the notion that starch is bad for you on its head. The Starch Solution is based on a simple swap: fueling your body primarily with carbohydrates rather than proteins and fats. This will help you lose weight and prevent a variety of ills.Fad diets come and go, but Dr. McDougall has been a proponent of the plant-based diet for decades, and his medical credibility is unassailable. He is one of the mainstay experts cited in the bestselling and now seminal China Study—called the “Grand Prix of epidemiology” by the New York Times. But what The China Study lacks is a plan.Dr. McDougall grounds The Starch Solution in rigorous scientific fact and research, giving readers easy tools to implement these changes into their lifestyle with a 7-Day Quick Start Plan and 100 delicious recipes. This book includes testimonials from among the hundreds Dr. McDougall has received, including people who have lost more than 125 pounds in mere months as well as patients who have conquered lifethreatening illnesses such as diabetes and cardiac ailments."

                    "One of my colleagues recommended this book, as following the diet has helped her child with an autoimmune condition. Although I'm glad it helped her child, this is not for me. A couple of things I didn't like about the writing: first, McDougall cites confounding lifestyle factors when a study disagrees with his philosophy, but he completely ignores them when it it convenient to do so, second, he claims absolute, incontrovertible evidence of causation (good and bad) in studies that show only correlation. I'm sticking with Walter Willett and his more moderate, This is what we have evidence for, and it might mean thus-and-such, so our best guess it that ________ is the way to go, until research proves or disproves... approach. McDougall's absolute certainty that he is right about everything makes me itch, I'd rather take my dietary advice from a guy who will tell me what he is reasonably sure of while admitting that we still have tons to learn.",

                    "It's about time I've read a book by Dr. McDougall. I've been hearing about him and seeing random tidbits from him here and there ever since I went vegan five years ago. This book just might be a life-changer for me. Even though I have never bought into low-carb diets and would always defend healthy carbs in whole grains, beans, fruits, and vegetables, I still held onto some carb-phobia, thinking I needed more fat and more protein to be healthy and satisfied. Now once and for all, I am convinced by the scientific evidence in this book, Dr. McDougall's decades of experience with his own/his patients' diets, and my own recent experimentation with my diet that a healthy high carb/starch diet will not make you fat, will not give you diabetes, and is, indeed, satisfying. That last part about it being satisfying is a huge deal for someone like me to say. I'm a lifelong food addict and have been overweight or obese (mostly obese) since I was 8 years old. I am rarely satisfied, I either go hungry after a meal if I eat a normal sized portion, or I stuff myself to discomfort. There is almost never middle ground, but I've noticed that eating starches gets me to that nice, physically, and most importantly for me, psychologically satisfied middle ground.A low-fat mostly whole foods plant-based diet with no calorie counting has worked for me in the past, but I wasn't satisfied often enough, so I went back to old habits even though I had lost 20 pounds. I realize now I wasn't satisfied because I was avoiding eating rice or potatoes or other high starch foods with my meals, and I was skipping out on fruit almost entirely. The only reason I was avoiding these things was because of some pseudo-science metabolic type diet book and just the general carb-phobia in our culture.I am glad Dr. McDougall included a chapter called The Fat Vegan. I can't stand when some writers mislead people when they say stuff like, If you go vegan, I promise you will lose weight. or Fat vegans are extremely rare. Yeah, right! Maybe I lost like 2 pounds when I went vegan, but I then quickly gained it back plus about another 20 when I figured out where to buy all the fatty vegan products (nondairy sour cream, cream cheese, cheese, butter, cookies, etc.) and how to eat for comfort just like I used to with nonvegan food. It's about time that writers start making the distinction between a low fat plant-based diet that can help you lose weight and a vegan diet done solely for ethical reasons (which can include chips, vegan cookies, cakes, pie, ice cream, french fries, tater tots, dark chocolate, and the list goes on).",
                    "Most important: do not just skip to the recipes in this book! As good as they are, I believe it's important to read and understand the detailed information on the basic building blocks of nutrition and the even more essential information on the health benefits and dangers of individual food types.I bought and read the first McDougall book many years ago, in the 1980s. At that time I read it straight through and followed the plan for a while. Unfortunately I slid away from the basics and my health suffered as a result. Although I was a lacto-ovo vegetarian since the end of 1982 and have been a vegan since the middle of 2007, and although I have read a great many articles on veganism and tried to maintain a reasonably healthy version of a vegan plan, I found when I read this book that I had forgotten some elements and that likely McDougall knows even more now than he did then. For example:* When he says starches he really means starches. Potatoes, rice, bread, pasta, legumes, among others. These types of foods need to take over at least half of your plate. Non-starchy vegetables take up another segment and fruit the rest. The evidence is in the book in the form of several studies over many years. * Isolated soy protein is as bad for you as animal protein. This I didn't know. I love my Gardein cutlets and Tofurky sausages but from here on these items have got to be for special occasions only. Foods made from isolated soy protein or, for that matter, isolated wheat protein, have significant impacts on the development of cancers and other serious diseases. The name of the game here is protein. Do not overdo it. It's dangerous.* Fish oils do not protect us from heart disease. They do provide us with dangerous levels of mercury. This is something I did know, but it's good to see it stated here, with evidence.* Supplements are not only not necessary (except possibly B12 and, in rare instances, small amounts of Vitamin D) but can be dangerous. When these nutrients are separated from the rest of the whole food they come from they cause our systems to react to the concentrated form and this reaction can be lethal. Don't be fooled into thinking can't hurt, might help because it's more likely that they can hurt.* Calcium! Interestingly, those who consume less calcium make better use of it. Those who consume large amounts do not benefit from the extra. We know this is true of the calcium in milk products, but it's important to realize it's also true of calcium supplements. Get your calcium from vegetables.There is a great deal more to read and absorb. For those who are new to a plant-based diet McDougall offers answers you can offer to your concerned meat-eating friends. Knowledge is power and it's also stress-reducing. Now, to the recipes. In the early McDougall books the recipes were very simple and I had the impression that the majority of them called for canned tomatoes or sauce. Understandable, given how useful and low-fat these foods are. Now, however, Mary McDougall has developed far more interesting and sophisticated recipes that continue to be easy to understand and prepare, and that call for familiar ingredients for most of us. I am excited to try them, and have committed myself to starting over, armed with a wealth of knowledge and enthusiasm. I hope you join me.",
                    "This book contains a lifestyle diet. It is very well written, complete yet not technical, with references to peer-reviewed articles. This is basically the same diet as recommended by The China Study, The Engine 2 Diet: The Texas Firefighter's 28-Day Save-Your-Life Plan that Lowers Cholesterol and Burns Away the Pounds, and Prevent and Reverse Heart Disease. While modern medicine is excellent for curing contagious diseases, it fails miserably against the so-called chronic diseases of the affluent. Dr. McDougall's approach is very much anti-medical establishment. A nutrition system that helps people avoid expensive medical treatments, and really cures or reduces chronic diseases is not in the health industry's economic interest. But Dr. McDougall has been treating patients for many years, and his nutrition guidelines really work. They worked wonderfully for me, so I highly recommend this book.",
                    "Solid health advice from a medical doctor with decades of experience using a starch-centered, low-fat vegan diet to help people improve their health. Not a lot of new information for me since I've read most of the author's previous books and monthly newsletter, but I do enjoy McDougall's writing style, and the fact that he backs up his recommendations with references in published, peer-reviewed medical journals. Mary McDougall's recipes are great too.",
                    "Yes! I was already doing most of the things Dr. McDougall recommends in this book, but how satisfying to read all the science behind why it is good for me and why I can continue to eat rice, potatoes, and pasta with veggies and salsa as much as I want, whenever I want."

                    "This is a fantastic cookbook with lots of interesting recipes for vegans, vegetarians, and even their carnivorous counterparts. I was looking for a good vegetarian crockpot cookbook because my other one is a bit bland. I was immediately sold on this one for a handful of reasons: Hester actually makes use of fake meat in her recipes, which adds some nice variety, the collection has a broad range of unique recipes (not just the regular stews and soups, but baked goods in a crock pot?! + lots of Indian-inspired dishes), all the recipes are broken down into what needs to be done the night before and what's done day of, and lastly, there is just an abundance of practical tips. Hester finally sold me on pre-slow cooking and freezing beans for later use, for instance. She also has a stupendous recipe for chickeny bouillon that I've stocked up on and used in all sorts of things (non slow cooker recipes included). When I get ambitious, I plan to follow her instructions for making my own fake chicken and beef. Highly recommended!",
                    "Finally inspired to buy a slow cooker to make cooking huge batches of beans easier, I had to get a cookbook to go alongside. The layout of the recipes is helpful, telling you if you need a smaller cooker or to double or triple a recipe if you only have a larger one. She also includes simple steps (like sauteing) that need to be done the night before.I haven't made very much yet, but there are a ton of recipes that look good. So far I've made:~Dry Beans from Scratch 5*~Split Pea &amp, Lentil Soup 4*~Creamy Potato Soup 2*, not a lot of flavor, but it was due to my broth~Pumpkin &amp, White Bean Lasagna 5*, this is off-the-charts deliciousness!~Spinach Artichoke Dip 4*, this was a chunky dip, a bit odd texture-wise for me, but the leftovers were scrumptious tossed with penne and topped off with cauliflower ricotta.",
                    "This book inspired me to buy a crockpot and I haven't turned back. It is probably not for a person who is new to being vegan or vegetarian--or looking for specific brand recommendations and step-by-step but as someone who has been vegetarian for 5 years and has never used a cookbook I had no problem making the recipes. Everything I have made has been super tasty, including the granola. I've also been inspired to make my own staples like cooking and freezing beans, sauce, etc. from scratch. I haven't tried any of the recipes that use fake meat. This book has changed the way I think about cooking and is a perfect companion to Wildly Affordable Organic. ",
                    "The three things I've made so far tasted really good but I had to make several educated guesses. This book skimps on the directions, which I feel is pretty unacceptable for a cookbook. Also, most cookbooks with recipes that call for ethnic or health food store ingredients give specific details guiding the reader on exactly what to buy, often listing particular brands and suggesting stores that carry the items. This book just says soy chorizo and throw it in the slow cooker. Do I mince it, crumble it, what am I supposed to do here?",
                    "We recently upgraded our slow cookers to a model that has three different sizes that can be hooked together or used separately. We’ve had some great successes using the slow cookers on the super busy swim team/soccer practice days and for entertaining large groups. I am not vegan, but enjoyed some of these recipes so much I now make the vegan version instead-- and the kids still like it. I also enjoyed using these recipes as sides in one of the smaller slow cookers to feel like I had a little more to put on the table for my four hungry guys. The Faux Mash Potatoes, Chock-Full of Veggies Cornbread, and the Subtly Spicy Peanut Coconut Fondue are among my favs in this book. For readers interested in slow cooking I would also recommend the America’s Test Kitchen Slow Cooker Revolution book that has some really great technique advice that can improve your success with any slow cooker recipe! – Alexis S.",
                    "A Little DisappointingThere are a few recipes from this book that have made it into our meal plans, however, I had hoped for more. A lot of the recipes call for meat replacements and ingredients that are not available at my normal local grocery store. I had really hoped for more recipes using fresh ingredients.Overall, I am glad that I read it. However, I wish that I had checked it out from the library instead of purchasing it."

                    "It's not easy finding good tasting recipes for vegan crockpot cooking. I've tried most come out mushy, lacking any distinguishable flavor. I looked through all the recipes, there is a good variety. I tried a couple recipes, Baigan Bharta (eggplant curry) and the Atomic Pecan Loaf, both were good and still held some flavor even after such long cooking time. Both could have been made quickly without using a crockpot. I also tried a couple that not one person out of five liked, Sage Walnut Pesto Squash, and Scrambled Tofu with Peppers. These tasted bland over cooked and had off textures. I found the ingredients easy to find but I live in a major metropolitan area, and can get to a specialty store easily. I did like the way the author set up a night before time table of prep work but why use a crockpot for such quick cooking dishes ? I cook and have made many of these dishes not using a crockpot. I don't see any time saving use for a crockpot for most of them, it actually takes away from the dish by over cooking. If you are dying to use your crockpot perhaps this is the book for you. The pictures are beautiful, the set up of the recipes wonderful, the spices are there, I might use this in the future minus the slow cooker.",
                    "My friend, Tracey, loaned me this. Oh, I think I am in for a real treat! I am looking forward to trying out some of these recipes this weekend. It is hot out. I love a slow cooker and not heating up the house. Mojito PINTO beans. pg.69. Yes, please! Lime, rum, mint all come together to create a bold flavor in these beans. It's what's for dinner!!!!! I have rum here already..of course! I have fresh mint in the garden. I have limes in the fridge!! I am getting hungry!I seriously think this is one of the best cookbooks I have right now. I have loved everything I have made so far. It is hot, hot, hot in Alabama here in August/September. I won't turn on the oven. I love my crockpot! This is my friend's book, but, I will be getting my own copy later this month. YUM!",
                    "So, I don’t have a slow cooker and might never get one. My building’s electricity is such that I wouldn’t trust leaving it plugged in when I wasn’t home. A friend gave me a pressure cooker years ago and so far it’s gone unused. I think the same thing might happen to its opposite, although this book sure makes it tempting to get and use a slow cooker. Why am I giving this book 5 stars when most dishes list at least one ingredient I don’t like and there is not a photo for every recipe, and I don’t have a slow cooker? (not yet, anyway) Because it’s a fabulous addition to the genre of vegan cooking and a wonderful book for cooks who do have slow cookers. I love the layout and organization, the author’s instructions and tips. The cooking directions are clear and yet causal, and I loved them. I appreciate that when applicable recipes are listed as soy free and/or gluten free, and so many of the recipes are both. I like that the author is frugally minded. The photos that are there are mouthwatering, and for me amazing that they were cooked in a slow cooker. And she frequently mentions whole grains as an option. I’m big on whole grains, not just for health but I find the taste and texture more satisfying than that of refined grain flours/foods.And then there are the recipes in the staples and the breads sections. Those are the ones that make it extremely temping to get a slow cooker. They might convince me to get one when my budget allows for it.Some of the staples recipes that have me longing for a slow cooker are dry beans from scratch, preserve-the-harvest tomatoes, beyond easy baked potatoes, any-occasion roasted garlic, fall harvest fruit butter, and perfect pumpkin purée. Some of the breads equally tempting are chock-full of veggies cornbread, foolproof focaccia, whole-wheat pumpkin gingerbread, crusty rosemary breakfast bread, wholesome chocolate chip banana bread.A smattering of other recipes that caught my eye (and most of the soups and stews would be perfect for me without the frequently included chicken flavored vegan bouillon) are Italian eggplant casserole with cashew-tofu ricotta, creamy butternut squash risotto, fantastic faux mashed potatoes, creamy scalloped potatoes, big pot of oatmeal, be-my-Valentine chocolate oatmeal, have-it-your way brownies, and berrylicious biscuit-topped fruit cobbler. The photo for that last one completely sold me.I can understand why the author has multiple slow cookers. It’s easy to make an entire meal of many dishes in these handy cookers.I love the quote from John Robbins at the beginning of the book. That man is the reason I went vegan when I did.I’m glad I own this one. Even without a slow cooker the recipes give me ideas for many things I can make. And the recipes that have one or two or three ingredients I don’t like (I guess I am a picky eater), well, they’re easy to tweak. I also suspect I’d want to add more seasoning to many dishes, and spicy and hot peppers to some, and the author even specifically mentions how and when to check for seasoning strength preferences.Contents:Introduction: Slow Cooker LoveChapter 1: Slow Cooker BasicsChapter 2: Staples You’ll Want to Know: Make Your Own Bouillon, Seitan, Sauces, and MoreChapter 3: Simmering Soups That Cook While You’re AwayChapter 4: Steamy Stews and Curries That Save the DayChapter 5: Casseroles (and Loaves) You Wish Your Mother Had MadeChapter 6: Easy-to-Make Pasta and Grain-DishesChapter 7: Mouthwatering Meatless MainsChapter 8: Super-Easy Side DishesChapter 9: Sandwich, Tortilla, and Taco FillingsChapter 10: Beautiful Breads Not From Your OvenChapter 11: Party Snacks That Cook While You’re Getting ReadyChapter 12: Breakfasts Worth Waking Up ForChapter 13: Decadent Desserts and Delightful DrinksAcknowledgmentsAbout the AuthorIndex"

                    "In the foreword to the cookbook, T. Colin Campbell, author of The China Study (and the father of cookbook author LeAnne Campbell), acknowledges that for adults used to the typical American diet, switching to a plant-based, no-added-fat diet can be challenging. For those who have chosen to make the lifestyle change, however, The China Study Cookbook is an invaluable guide to preparing tasty, nutritious meals that fully meet the requirements of the diet espoused by the Campbells.Before introducing the recipes, the book has some tips on food preparation, a Q&amp,A topic about raising children on a plant-based diet, and describes the seven categories of plants (plus mushrooms) that will be used in the recipes.The recipes include a wide variety of dishes, including breads and muffins, breakfast dishes, appetizers and salads, soups, sandwiches, entrées, side dishes, and desserts. In general, ingredients include whole grain flours, non-dairy milk, no refined sugar, egg replacers, no added fats, unprocessed complex carbohydrates, and plant foods that are as close to their original state as possible. The primary sweetener that's used is Sucanat - a product that's essentially pure dried sugar cane juice. Non-dairy milk includes rice, soy, or almond milk. Egg replacers are made from ground flaxseed meal mixed with water. Vegetables are typically cooked by baking, steaming, or sautéing in vegetable broth. Recipes are designed to minimize the amounts of fat, sugar, and salt. All recipes are accompanied by full-page color photographs. At first, I thought that the lack of nutritional information (calories, fiber, fat, carbohydrates, protein, etc.) was an unfortunate omission, but the author explained that nutrient contents in different samples of the same food are highly variable and that it's more important for the consumer to focus on the overall wholesomeness of a dish than the nutrient numbers.It's an impressive cookbook. The recipes look surprisingly tasty, considering the radical differences from traditional cooking. The lack of meat is perhaps the biggest difference, but the recipes use high-protein meat substitutes such as tofu. The author encourages personal experimentation to get the taste you prefer. This morning, my wife and I tried one of the recipes, Breakfast Home-Fry Hash, adjusting the recipe slightly, based on the ingredients we had on hand and our own tastes, and it was delicious. We're looking forward to trying more recipes from the book. At our age, I don't know if we're up to the challenge of going completely over to a plant-based diet, but if we were younger or had young children, we would be seriously considering it.A review copy of the book was provided by the publisher.",
                    "This cookbook focuses on plant-based whole food recipes. After reading it I decided to move it to my to-buy list because many of the flair and ingredient combinations are right in my personal flavor-palate. As with the gluten-free cookbooks I own, I am not an adherent to the lifestyle but just an enthusiastic cook (and eater) who finds some of the recipes and techniques interesting. Will I convert to using flax seeds and water as an egg substitute in baked goods permanently? Probably not! Will I give recipes that call for such substitutions (or for xanthan gum or non-dairy milks) a try? Sure!"

                    "Having read ‘The China Study’ in the past, I knew this cookbook would be filled with pertinent information on the effects of a plant based diet, and many recipes to easily incorporate into everyday meals. I was not disappointed.The recipes are indeed fairly simple, if not down right easy. No odd ingredient lists, and the meals are suitable for family fare. I do tweak many of the recipes to suit a low carb lifestyle (I’m diabetic, this is a must), so it should be noted that plant based does not equal low carb. One should be confident in the kitchen and/or willing to experiment in order to suit a lower carb intake, otherwise this book, while full of excellent health info, may prove otherwise a disappointment.",
                    "In decades past The China Study revealed that eating a diet with no animal products may help one avoid many of the diseases of affluent countries. Its author T. Colin Campbell has a daughter, LeAnne Campbell who has cooked vegan for over twenty years now, following the discoveries of the team her father described, and she even brought up two boys with the diet. She shares her recipes in this China Study Cookbook. I have been cooking from this book for several weeks now, covering most of the dishes, and my experience with the book has been a pleasant one.The book opens with a lengthy overview of what a China Study diet is and its benefits, followed by advice on how to get one’s kids to eat well. The recipes themselves, around 120 of them, cover salads, sandwiches, main dishes, and deserts. Campbell also describes how to make your own vegan mayonnaise, which can then accompany the sandwiches in the book. As none of the dishes call for very hot spices, and only one Indian masala dish really explodes with flavour, some readers may find the recipes a little bland. However, as someone with a very poor, meat-based diet up to buying this book, the fresh vegetables and make-your-own sauces (e.g. lemon, soy, and mustard) alone provided enjoyable new tastes.It is worth making clear that this book is based on the China Study diet, not on any other positions of how to eat healthy. Thus, many of the dishes use grains (usually whole-grain rice) and soy, in spite of contrary opinions that such ingredients are worth avoiding. Also, in a somewhat expected turn, since e.g. olive oil is vegan and well-regarded, Campbell recommends against adding oils to dishes (with the sole exception of tahina). While some might worry that a vegan diet is only for the wealthy, I found I actually saved money after sticking to this cookbook while at home, as before I had been spending so much money every day on fast food. You can work around some of the book’s more expensive ingredients if you want (nutritional yeast, Sucanat), and even when recipes call for fancy stuff, they often use so little of the product that it lasts you a long time.I am based in Romania and encountered this book in its Romanian translation Studiul china: carte de bucate. Readers outside the United States will find that the book is, as perhaps can only be expected, based on what’s available in American supermarkets. Thus there are recipes for some items (e.g. black-eyed peas) that can be hard to find in some countries. Furthermore, while several recipes use the maple syrup so popular in North America (and which can usually be found in the EU as well), the author doesn’t consider other syrups that might be cheaper in some markets.Downsides? The photos are not always helpful. Sometimes they don’t clearly depict how certain ingredients should turn out in the end. Also, this is a vegan cookbook that calls for whole-grain rice, yet one of the photos shows a treat smothered in ice cream, and the rice dishes look like they were made from white rice. The time given for how long it takes to prepare each recipe is also way too optimistic. My wife loves to cook and is proficient in the kitchen, and we divide up the tasks, but many of the recipes take twice as long as Campbell suggests. Still, there are relatively minor complaints, and I think many readers would enjoy using this cookbook. I know that I’m feeling a lot more energetic after eating this diet.",
                    "This cookbook was written to be a companion to The China Study by T. Colin Campbell. LeAnne Campbell, the author of this cookbook, is his daughter. Dr. Campbell really sums up this book in his forward: I am prejudiced and I might as well say so up front. The author of this book is my daughter, LeAnne Campbell Disla. But prejudiced or not, I know her style of cooking, her recipes (I’ve tried many), her commitment to good nutrition and, as a very busy professional, her ability to prepare quick nutritious meals.I can judge whether I'm going to like a cookbook in the first thirty seconds or so of flipping through it. It's been a long time since I've browsed a cookbook and wanted to try several recipes—but that's what happened with this one. Plant-based/vegan cookbooks tend to be a little out there: ingredients are hard to find, recipes just sound weird, too much judgmental commentary, mile-long ingredient list. But this one is just right. Most of the recipes are something I would eat, and very few call for ingredients I don't already have on hand or couldn't get at my grocery store. What's more, many of them are very quick and simple to prepare. (Caveat: I have not actually tried any of these recipes yet. But I will soon!)I like that the author doesn't pay attention to minute details, like what kind of tortillas you buy (or admonish you to make your own). Things like this tend to derail me when I'm trying something new, and I appreciate that she doesn't make a big deal of it. The one weak point of this book is the photography. I love that there are photographs for almost every recipe, but they are blurry and out of focus. "

                    "Copied from my amazon review: I borrowed this book from the library. The author clearly is a vegan since all dairy products were omitted and dismissed as unhealthy. I can accept that being vegan is someone's culinary point of view, but she never stated that outright anywhere in her book, and I feel she should have because her outright dismissal of dairy was off putting to me. Then I started researching how to get all the superfood additives and ingredients the author uses. Low and behold, all of these specialty ingredients can be purchased here on amazon from the Navitas Naturals company that the author works for according to the little bio on the back cover. So this book is really a subtle and slick way of promoting this company's products, not how to make a healthy and tasty smoothie with readily available foods. Personally, I refuse to spend $60/lb or more for a single ingredient, even if that ingredient would make many smoothies. It's not practical. $31.99 for 8 oz of acai berry powder, really? How about 6 1/2 pints of fresh, locally grown raspberries or blueberries instead? So the book is a disappointment. Glad I only borrowed it and didn't buy it.",
                    "This is the height of gustatory snobbery! Are you a wealthy, lactose intolerant vegan living in New York City? This book may be for you!On the other hand, if you're a middle-class, milk-loving resident of rural Montana whose budget has no room for weekly purchases of Thai coconuts ( Morris sniffs and condescends to mention there are other, oh-so-inferior types out there.), then I'd suggest you spend your money elsewhere.Nearly every recipe in this book calls for specialty items such as camu powder, goji berries, and lucuma fruit. And Morris-the-Milk-Hater will go so far as to pair cauliflower with chocolate to get creaminess. *rolls eyes* She also pretends that tea is non-acidic and better for you than any animal product. Thus, if you think it odd that some of us don't actually keep a supply of dried mulberries and coconut water on hand, and if you think that peanut butter is only fit for the smoothies you make your German Shepherd in order to get him to eat kale, then this book is probably a good choice for you. However, if you rather prefer mixed fruit and yogurt smoothies over a combination of apples and broccoli with dates, if you cannot afford to buy dozens of ingredients that cost over $10.00 a pound, or if you live in a place where a pomegranate is a bit exotic and nobody at the local grocery store gives a hoot in heck what maca powder is, then you should probably not bother with this book.Personally, I received it as a gift, and I did find it made for very amusing reading, hence I gave it two stars instead of one."

                    " I couldn't help but glance at some other reviews as I prepared to write mine. I thought hey, maybe in my little podunk town in Maryland, we're just not hip enough to have specialty stores where one must go to find the ingredients required for pretty much ALL of these smoothie recipes. Maybe it's just me?Turns out, it's not. Sadly, I bought this book new from Amazon, thinking it would give me excellent ideas for diversifying my smoothies. Alas, unless you are filthy rich and can afford (much less pronounce) all of the exotic, hard-to-find ingredients that these recipes call for, you're in for a disappointment. The Oh She Glows or Detox: 100 Recipes cookbooks have much better, easier, practical smoothie recipes.

                    "Love SUPERFOOD SMOOTHIES! I have the entire collection of Julie Morris books and this one is my favorite. I have tried many of the recipes and enjoy all of them. I have bookmarked many pages. Great to use with my Vitamix. I often need to substitute items due to being a vegan and my serious food allergies, however, a fabulous selection. I have purchased and tried many new items and ingredients, due to this great book. The hardcover is beautiful with high res images and easy to follow instructions and recipes. If you love smoothies and healthy living, this is the book. I also recommend Julie Morris's collection: (The Superfood Smoothies, and these three: Superfood Juices, Superfood Soups, and Superfood Snacks are the same size. Superfood Kitchen is larger. I am pretty picky about cookbooks (photography and quality recipes). These books have it all!",
                    "We love smoothies at our house, so when my husband brought me this book (free from the library's free book swap section) I was happy to have a source for new recipes. Unfortunately, absolutely none of the recipes would work for our family. Why? Every single one calls for expensive purchased superfoods which are apparently sold by the author's company. She never says she works for the company, but other reviewers did the detective work to find that out and it was a bit of an aha moment for me. I couldn't for the life of me figure out why every single recipe had to call for a superfood like a tablespoon of dried mulberries (and she warns not to leave any ingredients out!). Now I happen to be lucky and our family forages mulberries every summer, but the author points out that most people cannot find them locally and will need to purchase them online. For a ton of money. Why???? I love mulberries and they do have some great benefits (I didn't know about the anti-aging component, which is awesome), but if I didn't have local access I'd just use another ingredient. Come on now.She also points out that one single serving of each smoothie will cost nearly $5 with the ingredients that she calls for, but she says that's a great price because it can easily be a meal substitute. WTH? Just no. You can be healthy and frugal. Smoothies and good health are not just for the super-rich. For that matter, you can forage quite a few of the ingredients for free (mulberries, black raspberries, purslane, nettles, blueberries, clover, wild plums, watercress, highbush cranberries...). Maybe that should be my next foraging book.... ,) ",
                    "It was cool and all (actually found some really neat ideas for interesting smoothies) but sort of a shame that what this really is, at the end of the day, this book, it's a ploy to get you to buy certain products from a certain merchandiser. Ignore the fact that the real title of the book is secretly Superfood Smoothies: 100 Delicious, Energizing &amp, Nutrient-dense Recipes: Sponsored by Navitas Naturals.Definitely check it out (literally*), but don't be afraid to substitute ~60% of the ingredients for each recipe. You're gonna sort of have to. (*Don't buy the book, absolutely get it from the library).(It's like if I was commissioned to write a book on training to run a half marathon, and I was being paid by Nike to write the book, and in the contract, Nike's stipulations included that for each chapter, I must mention or end with recommended Nike active-wear, as part of the training. This is that book. Except replace half marathon with smoothies and Nike with Navitas Naturals and no mention (except for a thank you in the acknowledgments) of the fact that Navitas Naturals is trying to get you to buy their products).#tricky"

                    "Hollywood celebrities are doing it. Corporate moguls are doing it. But what about those of us living in the real world—and on a real budget? Author and holistic health practitioner Victoria Moran started eating only plants nearly thirty years ago, raised her daughter, Adair, vegan from birth, and maintains a sixty-pound weight loss. In Main Street Vegan, Moran offers a complete guide to making this dietary and lifestyle shift with an emphasis on practical “baby steps,” proving that you don’t have to have a personal chef or lifestyle coach on speed dial to experience the physical and spiritual benefits of being a vegan. This book provides practical advice and inspiration for everyone—from Main Street to Wall Street, and everywhere between. “Finally, a book that isn't preaching to the vegan choir, but to the people in the pews—and the ones who can’t fit in those pews. This is a book for the Main Street majority who aren’t vegans. Once you read this, you'll know it's possible to get healthy and enjoy doing it—even if you live in Paramus or Peoria.”—Michael Moore “A great read for vegans and aspiring vegans.”—Russell Simmons “Yet another divine gift from Victoria Moran. Main Street Vegan covers it all—inspiration, information, and out of this world recipes. This book is a gem.\"—Rory Freedman, co-author Skinny Bitch “Main Street Vegan is exactly the guide you need to make changing the menu effortless. Victoria Moran covers every aspect of plant-based eating and cruelty-free living, with everything you need to make healthy changes stick.” —Neal Barnard, MD, president, Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine, and NY Times bestselling author of 21-Day Weight Loss Kickstart “A great book for anyone who's curious about veganism. It shows that not all vegans are weirdos like me.”—Moby"

                    "Main Street Vegan is a thoroughly accessible guide to becoming a vegan – or a vegetarian, or even just cutting more meat out of your life. With a non-preachy tone and a realistic perspective on modern life with a left-of-norm diet, Victoria Moran educates, inspires, and provides a supportive starting point for all readers.Full disclosure: I was a vegetarian from birth until age 28. For a time in college, I lived with a vegan who I found insufferable because of her dietary choices. Despite being a very strict lacto-ovo-vegetarian, I never, EVER considered going vegan. Then, when I was 28, I decided to try eating meat to see what I was missing – I had no particular religious, moral, or ethical reasons for being vegetarian, and “habit” didn’t seem like a good enough reason. I found a few meat dishes I liked okay, but mainly I appreciated the utter convenience of being able to order anything off of any given menu.But it didn’t stick. Within two years of becoming omnivorous, I was back to being mainly vegetarian because, I don’t know, it just seems right to me. And now, thanks to Main Street Vegan, I’m considering going all the way – all the way to egg-free, diary-free, leather-free naturalness.We’ll see. The lure of eating meat for me was the convenience – turkey sandwiches were a revelation to me in terms of the ease of packing a lunch for work. Making my own “cheese” from cashew nuts is pretty much the opposite direction of that. Still, I find that many vegan meals work themselves into my meal preparation, and I generally like all of them. Why not experiment with that a little bit? The recipes in Main Street Vegan sound delicious and are an easy place to start.Moran covers a lot more ground than just diet – she thoughtfully covers ethical situations ranging from honey to zoos to cleaning products to cosmetics to pest control within the home. Her sections on travel and dining out are considerate and well-reasoned. In general, the entire book is an exceedingly well-thought-out series of essays on one person’s life choices – laid out in such a reasonable way that it’s hard not to be convinced after just a few pages.While this isn’t a decision I’m making lightly, I’m definitely mulling it over – and I’ll be turning back to Main Street Vegan frequently as I consider my choices."

                    "Wow! I cannot rate this book with fewer than 5 stars, even though there were some things that bothered me, big time. I’ll get those out of the way first. I don’t like that for eating disorders the only advice dispensed is to participate in OA, a 12 step program. I’m really sick of not having alternatives mentioned. I loved how the first author talked about her own earlier years’ struggle with food and eating, but her way is not the only way. I also don’t like the hedges on honey and veganism. And then there is the whole you'll lose weight as a vegan claim, though she does make clear that's if you eat the healthy stuff and don't overeat. There are a few other such things.But overall, I agree with these (mother-daughter) authors about everything they say.I came to this book skeptical in the sense that I thought because I’m an experienced and long time vegan, I wouldn’t take that much from it. But I loved it.I appreciate how this could be a life changing book for many people now, the way Diet for a New America was for me in 1988, over 24 years ago. I am in awe of how many issues are addressed. In fact, with books such as this, I usually include their contents in my review. Here, there are 6 dense pages of contents, too long to share, and so much content within each section. I love the messages given here, the philosophy espoused. I like her take on how to be vegan or how to move in that direction. I admire her priorities. I love how Victoria is a good mother and loved learning about Adair and enjoyed Adair’s contributions to this book. I love the mother-daughter angle, their history and now when both are adults. Every time I thought of something that should be included, I eventually came across it as I continued reading. I love that recipes are included and think they are good ones for a vegan primer. This (first) author is a health food, primarily raw, vegan, but she, of course, is vegan for the animals, and the environment and world hunger are mentioned too, all reasons to be vegan are at least touched on. I adore quotes so I really liked that each chapter begins with a fabulous quote. The book’s dedication is one of the best ever: “To the animals I’ve known by name and to all those who have no names.” So powerful!I read this book with new vegans and the vegan interested in mind, to see if I would recommend it to them. I do, heartily, and I also recommend it to experienced vegans such as myself, especially activists, but also just as one more supportive book.This is an entertaining read. It’s fun to read, and at times I laughed and smiled, and at times I felt sad. I experienced the gamut of emotions. Much to my surprise, if I was in book buying mode, I’d purchase this book. Mine is a library copy. It’s a wonderful book, an all in one re content, and very accessible, very friendly, I don’t know a better way to describe it. I liked it so much more than I’d anticipated. Because of the 12 step content I thought I was going to give it only 4 stars, but I just can’t downgrade for that. Many will like that and for those such as me who don’t, I trust that we’re smart enough to ignore the few things here that don’t work for us because most of what’s included is exceptionally useful. Throughout the book and in the back of the book, there is a lot of good resource material.I had many things reinforced for me and I learned some things too. The next time I get my B12 tested I’ll do the MMA urine test instead of a blood test.I think that this book will be most appreciated by new vegans, the vegan interested, experienced vegans, readers who know vegans, in that order, and by parents and other mentors in all those categories, and definitely by vegan activists too. I surely hope so.Great addition to the genre!",
                    "The best book ever!Vegans are cool and plant-based dining is hot.If you're only going to read one book this year - pick up Main Street Vegan. It will change your life. It is so much more than a book about being a vegan, it is a book about being a compassionate healthy person - the very best you can be. I actually cried reading this book. I almost never do it, and for a non-fiction book to affect me that way. I am so inspired by Victoria Moran and I will definitively pick up her back list. Much of Main Street Vegan is light reading and light of heart, about great food, looking good, and feeling fantastic, but parts of it may be tough going, especially if you're reading for the first time about what the animals go though.This book cover everything from the animals, the ethics, the compassion, the love, the food, the clothes, the honey, the circus, the make-up, the wine, the kids and includes a lot of delicious recipes. I read this because I was curious about going vegan - now I am sure that I'm ready for the transition. It covers everything I worry about: going to restaurants, travel abroad and dealing with non-supportive surroundings. The main message is that everything you do is great - even if it is to start with meatless Monday. The idea is to do this, either all at once or in stages, in a way that's comfortable and fun, improves your health, makes sense in your actual life, and lasts forever.The book is written for new vegans, but I imagine that I will go back to this wonderful book many times and I am sure it is a great inspiration, reminder and boost also for long time vegans. There are so many amazing parts - I am glad I got the kindle edition so I could make (a lot) of highlights! However, I am off to buying the hardcover edition as well - I must have it on my book shelves. I cannot emphasize enough how much I loved this book. I want to give it to everyone I know but I will take Victoria's advice and don't push it onto people. I would recommend it to everyone, except maybe if you absolutely want to be able to eat you meaty junk food without thinking about it. 5++ stars!The bottom line is: This is not difficult, it is just new. New and wonderful.",
                    "Main Street Vegan is my new handbook. Kinda like the Handbook for the Recently Deceased in Beetlejuice. I feel like if I leave my house without a copy I will instantly be swallowed whole by a giant sandworm. Seeing that I had to return my copy to the library today, I'm a little worried for the trip home...Seriously though, I loved this book and will be buying a copy for myself. The chapters were short and to the point, and I feel like the author covered all of the burning questions that a vegan newbie like myself might ask. There's also more resources in the appendices than you could shake a stalk of celery at. The unprocessed cherry on top of the non-dairy ice cream is the recipe at the end of each chapter from either the author, her daughter or a well-known veganite (probably not a real word but it sounds cool). ",
                    "Quite a good book on the topic. Only frustrating thing was that the author is Christian and it also got a little too esoteric, as well as almost jumping off the deep end vis a vis mobile phone radiation and using plants to cleanse your home........That said based on probabilities it seems better to go vegan. This book has great advice on how to do it, why to do it, and what you can expect. It's broken down into very digestible parts (excuse the pun) that are super easy to read and comprehend. Will need to do further research but yes, this is a good overview of the lifestyle.",
                    "An absolute must-read (and eventually own) for anyone merely flirting with the idea of trying out a part-time vegan diet, all the way to someone wishing to adopt a complete vegan lifestyle. Friendly, witty and never preachy, Ms. Moran addresses virtually every question you might have or will have posed to you, a cornucopia of inspiring information on health and nutrition, ethics and the environment, cruelty-free living and shopping, and much more! This is not a cookbook, though each chapter ends with one of the author's favorite recipes. --Kate D.",
                    "really interesting, informative read. ",
                    "This book was interesting and informative, but there were some brief flashes of crazy. I was happy to read all about how to navigate he real world with a vegan diet and lifestyle, but when the author entertained the idea that cats could eat a vegan diet when given the proper supplements I had to take a pause (paws). Just no. I may refer to this book for my own information, but when I need help with my kitties, I’ll go to a licensed vet. "

I love that she explains things so thoroughly and oftentimes shares short anecdotes of where she learned how to make a particular recipe. I would highly recommend this to absolutely anyone wanting to learn how to cook Indian food, meateaters included (please don't be scared off by the fact that it is a vegetarian cookbook!)

                    "If you could only have one cookbook, this is the one I would choose. It's easily my favorite, and without a doubt the definitive resource on Indian food for vegetarians. Since I am a vegetarian, I don't miss the meat dishes, but even before I gave up meat I loved the breadth of cuisine covered in this weighty tome. I received a copy as a gift when a naturopath insisted I had a gluten sensitivity - I didn't, but there was a few months where bread was off the menu, and it was all the Vaisnava festival flatbread recipes (they don't use wheat then) that my friend thought would be helpful. By the time I had made all the flatbread recipes I was completely in love with the clear, direct instructions, and the commentary on everything from temple cooking to pomegranates. It's the only book I've ever seen with a recipe for curry of young, tender loofah squashes - which works equally well for zucchini if you don't happen to have loofahs on hand. You really do have to read this cookbook. It doesn't have a photograph in it, but the recipes and descriptions of the food and where the recipe came from will give your imagination a clearer picture of the cuisine than a photograph ever will. It is truly a work of love, and of genius.",

The multitudinous recipes are complemented by discussion of the cultural relevance of various foods and food practices and a useful guide to Indian food tools and techniques. Novices to this cuisine (like myself) diving into this book will probably find a need to stock up on some specialized equipment, but that's not critical for each recipe. Used in-depth, this book constitutes a thorough introduction to cooking as a whole, and the resources list is still useful.",

                    "Eating the Moosewood Restaurant way every day has never been easier.Whole grains. Fresh fruits and vegetables. Lean, nutrient-rich fish. We all know the virtues of a well-balanced diet—of choosing foods that nourish our bodies and respect the environment—but as the world around us gets busier and more complicated, we also know how difficult it can be to prepare a wholesome, satisfying supper. With an emphasis on healthful natural foods, Moosewood Restaurant has operated successfully for more than thirty years and has been acclaimed as a driving force in the world of creative vegetarian cuisine. Now the Moosewood Collective goes back to basics with Moosewood Restaurant Simple Suppers to deliver fresh, imaginative, and quickly prepared dishes for the weeknight table that are also delicious and reliable.Shortcut Chili. Creamy Lemon Pasta. Warm French Lentil Salad. Pine Nut–Crusted Fish. Mocha Sorbet. From soups and pastas made with just a few pantry essentials to crisp salads, stir-fries, sandwiches, and desserts, these easy-to-prepare recipes are brilliant as is. However, the folks at Moosewood realize that flexibility is the cornerstone of weeknight cooking, so you’ll find clever ingredient substitutions, alternative cooking methods, and serving suggestions alongside the recipes in Simple Suppers—it all depends on what’s in the fridge and what sounds appetizing at the moment. Make extra Fresh Tomato and Mozzarella Salad on Monday and toss leftovers with hot pasta for Tuesday’s supper. No onions for Black Beans with Pickled Red Onions? Try the beans over rice with Quick Avocado and Corn Salsa instead. The 175-plus recipes in Moosewood Restaurant Simple Suppers are as flexible as they are flavorful—the perfect go-to for a quick, healthy meal any day of the week, any time of year.We crave simple food. We want cooking at home to be a small pleasure—relaxed enough that we can enjoy the process as well as the results. When we mentioned to friends that we were thinking of doing a book of recipes for simple suppers, inevitably they exclaimed, “That’s the one I need” or “Write that book for me.” The idea of simple suppers strikes a chord within us all. We hope this cookbook will help make suppertime a welcome, peaceful time of your day. —from the Introduction"

                    "This is a great cookbook with some real winners, but also some so-so recipes, and a few ridiculous recipes, like corn on the cob or fresh tomato salad, which is chopped tomatoes with basil and fresh mozzarella tossed with olive oil. I make that all the time in the summer and never considered it a recipe. I guess they aren't kidding when they titled this simple!Recipes we tried:Broccoli and Tomato SaladMy daughter made this for her school lunch, and raved about it. I neither made it nor ate it! It's basically steamed broccoli and fresh tomatoes tossed with a simple balsamic &amp, olive oil dressing. Sounds like this is a make again recipe.Sour cream lemon dressingLily made this for her lunch and said it was too sour, she added extra plain yogurt to improve it.Pasta with Greens &amp, RicottaThis was my Mother's Day dinner and it was fantastic! Lily said it was very simple to make too, the 25 minutes time seems accurate. Says serves 4-6 and we got 5 servings. We will definitely make this again. For dessert, we had Chocolate Ricotta Pudding (we were unintentionally All About Ricotta.)Chocolate Ricotta PuddingThis was amazing, and (once we got the blender to spin against the cooling, gardening chocolate) very easy. We will definitely make this again.Sesame Tofu with SpinachI thought this was fantastic!!! I will definitely make this again ... on a night when I'm only cooking for myself because I was the only one who liked it. (Recipe says this will please even the tofu-phobic and that turns out to be false. Daughter #2 wouldn't even try it. Her loss, my gain, more leftovers for me!!!) Recipe calls for 10oz of baby spinach but Wegmans sells 8 oz bags, so I threw in a few chopped baby bok choy, this was excellent.Creamy lemon pasta  This was good, but too oily - next time make with half and half instead of heavy cream. We added half a bag of baby spinach and a bag of baby arugula. It needed the greens.Bean and cheese quesadillas Extremely simple and not impressive. I've never baked quesadillas before, and I won't do it again. We used black beans instead of refrigerator beans, because refried beans are gross. I wasn't crazy about the salsa cooked IN the quesadilla either.Pasta with Olives PiquantI thought this was fantastic!!. My kids weren't so crazy about it. I used basil instead of parsley because Lily doesn't like parsley, and topped with plenty of Parmesan. It would be even better with some pine nuts.Whole Grain Pasta with Greens and Tomatoes Boring name but a good meal! I was the only one who really liked it, though. We used endive, I would make this again, and it might be interesting to try with different greens.Shrimp Curry with Snow PeasThis was fantastic! I am learning that I really like recipes with coconut milk (which is a surprise, because I don't like coconut). I also realize now that I forgot to add the basil - oops!! It was a little watery, not sure how to fix that (maybe use less coconut milk?). Served over rice, we got four servings, just like the book says. We will definitely make this again, we all loved it.Poached Huevos Rancheros Meh. It was okay. It was really simple, though! The two of us ate it all, so 2 servings is accurate. We weren't quite sure HOW to eat it though ... roll it up like a burrito? cut it in pieces and eat with a fork? I ended up folding it in thirds like an enchilada and slicing it up.Lemony Green BeansExtremely simple. Basically just toss cooked green beans with lemon juice and olive oil. (And it was too much lemon juice.) This would be a nice way to prepare vegetables if you like your vegetables with lemon. Which I do not. We served this with Sesame Broccoli and (gasp!) grilled sausage. The confirmed vegetarian in our family had a (homemade) veggie burger.Sesame BroccoliExtremely simple. Basically just toss cooked broccoli with dark sesame oil, salt, and red pepper flakes. I added some sesame seeds, too. I'll probably make this again (I mean, it's so simple, why wouldn't I??)Chipotle Potato SaladBasically, potato salad made with the chipotle mayo recipe in this book, which is mayo + canned chipotles in adobo sauce + lemon juice (and it was kind of annoying that these recipes were not on the same page). This was very good, and pretty easy, a nice twist on the classic potato salad. I even liked the chopped red bell pepper in it, and I don't usually like peppers. It would be good with some corn added, too. We will probably make this again.Green Fried RiceWhen I looked at this recipe, it did NOT look very good! I mean, fried rice with eggs, soy sauce, and chili paste, sure! But with bok choy and spinach and corn??? I was skeptical. Those things didn't belong in my fried rice. But my daughter (who doesn't like eggs) chose this recipe, and she made it for us, she said it was pretty easy, and all three of us loved it! We will definitely make this again. It says serves 4 and that's how many servings we got.Lemony Couscous with ChickpeasThis (like the green fried rice) is featured in the main dish grains section, but I think this recipe would be better as a side dish, maybe at a potluck. Or it needs to be revamped, add some zucchini and grape tomatoes, perhaps. Something. It was good, but I didn't want a whole plate full of just this.Asian Braised Fish with GreensThis was good but not amazing. We had this on udon noodles. Next time I make it I'll cut the amount of fish in half, because I don't like fish leftovers, and we can't eat 1.5 lbs of fish in one setting!! I should have thought of that before.Saucy Hungarian Eggplant with BulghurWow this was so good!! And surprisingly fast to make! I will definitely make this again. In fact, I think this recipe sold me on buying the book. Dear Library, I can return your copy!",
                    "Fun to browse, and the recipes I've tried so far have done what they've said on the tin - flexible, tasty, and not too time-consuming. A keeper!",
                    "This is very usable book. I have worked my way through almost 70 of the recipes and all have been fairly easy to prepare and satisfying to my family. Our favorites include Creamy Lemon Pasta, Jop Chai, Caesar Salad with Tofu Croutons, Spinach-Cheese Burritos, and the super-delicious Cilantro Lime Dressing.",
                    "This book is ok. I appreciate that the recipes are simple and usually result in a minimal amount of clean-up afterward, however I think that in some cases adding another pot or pan to the clean-up could have resulted in a better recipe.A few of the recipes I made were awesome, I made them multiple times and they were great every single time. A few recipes were abject failures, either by my own fault or because the recipe was just a flop.The Good:Asparagus avgolemono (pg 130)This soup is so good! Especially served with toasted rye or pumpernickel bread. Mmm. The lemon juice adds a nice tang to it. I found it to be a bit much when the soup was served fresh but thought that it became milder after a few days. It's good either way, though, and this is a simple recipe that just works. It has a complex combination of flavors, but uses only a few ingredients and is very simple to prepare. I used dried dill instead of fresh, and I think it came out wonderfully.Broccolini cheddar melt (pg 138)I misread the name as Broccoli originally and so bought broccoli to make these sandwiches. Broccoli works fine but I guess if you can find this Broccolini creation in your supermarket, go for it. These sandwiches are really simple, filling, and tasty. I made this recipe a few times and it's a keeper. Really simple but delicious and hearty.Vegetarian reuben (pg 143)This probably sounds like a complete abomination, but let me tell you...it's good. And really simple. It's essentially coleslaw, tomato, and swiss cheese on toasted rye or pumpernickel bread. I hate coleslaw, but loved these sandwiches. I made up a full batch of the cabbage/dressing recipe and kept it in the fridge to make sandwiches over the course of 3 or 4 days. It kept pretty well and made for easy prep. I think it's the sloppiness of these sandwiches that's so reminiscent of a real reuben, not necessarily the flavor...but regardless...it's really good.The Bad:Pasta with artichoke hearts and feta (pg 29)This recipe sounded absolutely delicious and I couldn't wait to make it. Now I have a giant bowl of leftover pasta in my fridge and I have a sinking feeling that most of it is going to end up in the trash. There are a few reasons for this. One pound of pasta is just way too much in comparison to the amounts of the other ingredients. The pasta to other-stuff ratio is just...off. Second of all, the recipe instructs you to add a cup of hot pasta-water to the feta and whisk until smooth. I found that achieving a smooth consistency was quite simply impossible. I'd much rather have made an extra dish to clean by using a small sauce pan over low heat on the stove instead of mixing it in a bowl--it probably would have worked better. Third, there just seems to be something missing. Some other vegetable or spice or...something. It's just a whole lot of pasta (too much pasta), artichoke hearts, and some cheese basically. It needed something else.Green and white bean gratin (pg 57)This recipe was probably a failure because of my own errors, not necessarily by any failure of the recipe itself. It came out pretty horribly, and again, I have a feeling the leftovers are not going to be eaten by anyone. First of all...am I the only one who has no idea what the heck white beans are? I stupidly bought a few cans of beans that were literally white, but upon further research on the internet later discovered that white beans are not necessarily WHITE beans. So there was my first problem. I'd have appreciated a note somewhere in the recipe listing the types of beans that would be suitable. Second of all, I don't own a blender so that part of the instructions kind of got thrown out the window and I mashed the beans with a fork instead. It worked alright but after baking, the results were just not good (although it smelled great, which gave me hope...false hope).Red bean, potato and arugula soup (pg 124)This soup was easy to prepare and serving it over arugula was kind of novel and made me feel fancy and sophisticated. This was another recipe that I felt was just too simple, however. The actual soup is basically composed of 2 main ingredients, red beans and potatoes. It gets old after about 4 bites. The lemon juice also adds a tangy-ness that I didn't think was great for this particular soup, especially if served with parmesan or romano cheese as recommended--it's just a little too much considering the very subtle earthy flavors of the beans and potatoes. Not that great, but at least the scant leftovers will likely be consumed rather than trashed.Overall, I think this book has some good recipes to offer, and most of them are simple to prepare and require minimal clean-up. Sometimes I just think that simplicity came at the expense of flavor.",
                    "There were a few recipes in here I will actually try. There's lots and lots of vegetarian/vegan options for those who need them. My husband and I are pretty plain eaters, besides his affection for all things Mexican food, we have a pretty basic palette. That being said, quite a few of these simple recipes had ingredients we would never purchase (what the heck is a Keiffer lime leaf?) so this book wasn't ideal for us. However, for those who eat more broadly across international cuisines, this book would be a great tool for exploration. ",

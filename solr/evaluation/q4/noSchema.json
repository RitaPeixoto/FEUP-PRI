                    "Lord and Lady Smythe.Just your average, everyday, boring members of the ton.With the same average, everyday, boring problems.Except for the part where they're each (unbeknownst to the other) spies for the British government, who end up vying for the same contract in order to win the prized spot on the intelligence team.Which leads to all kinds of surprises for both parties.So yes. This is a cliche, silly, over the top, Regency (is this Regency?) version of Mr. &amp, Mrs. Smith. Complete with the meet-cute fight scene - during which Mr. Smythe learns what the term fight like a girl really means. Turns out, there's a lot of pent-up sexual frustration between these two. Whodathunkit?Of course, for contrived reasons, they decide to work together despite their trust issues. And (after a rocky start) end up working everything out, catching the bad guy, and falling in love.Duh!Alright. If you're looking for a historically accurate romance, look elsewhere. This is just fluff with some fertility &amp, misscarriage issues thrown in for good measure. But this was just what I happened to be looking for, so none of it bothered me at all. In fact, I had so much fun reading this I've already got the rest of the books in this series on hold already.Not too shabby.",

                    "Well, when I saw the premise of this book months ago I was really excited about it. A Regency Mr and Mrs Smith? Sign me up! Now, did Ms Galen deliver a smart, snappy, sexy adventure? Yes, yes and yes!Lord Adrian Smythe is devastated when he is told he is to retire from his spy life in the Barbican group. After all, he has just delivered one of their most sought after criminals but he grudgingly accepts his new life--that of being a true husband and leading a normal, boring life. When just a few days into his 'retirement' he receives a missive from his former boss, Adrian is thrilled and relieved. But the surprise he receives upon arriving at the meeting throws his entire life into a tailspin.Lady Sophia Smythe has perfected her life as a mousy, quiet lady while the entire time living her own double life as a spy in the Barbican group, following in the footsteps of her father and brother. She is furious when her last capture is intercepted by a mystery man and she looses the credit for the capture. And then to add insult to injury, she is told her services are no longer needed. She loathes the idea of being just a wife and when she also receives a missive for a mysterious midnight meeting, Sophia is quite relieved. She arrives early and when she hears someone coming, she attacks. She quickly realizes the man is also quite skilled in fighting and she is floored when she realizes who the man is. Her husband, Adrian. Naturally, as these two discover just who the other truly is, sparks fly, tempers explode and the need to outsmart the other is all too clear. Together, Sophia and Adrian are presented with one more task, to find a murderer of the prime ministers brother and why. But there is one small catch...only one will be permitted back into the Barbican group. This forces the two to constantly be on their toes, always trying to be one step ahead of the other but they gradually realize that working together might not be so bad. This was truly a delightful romance adventure full of some of the funniest dialogue between a hero and heroine that I have enjoyed in awhile but somehow still, the story was sexy and moving at the same time. Adrian and Sophia married out of duty but have never truly disliked each other, they just have not really know the other and they have had to overcome a truly heartbreaking situation that leads them to be more at odds with each other. I loved watching Adrian protect Sophia whenever something came up in their search for the murderer that affected her on this personal level, very swoonworthy :) Sophia tucks this show of emotions inside her to examine more closely later. Also during their search, Sophia is finally able to present herself as her true self and it helps take some of the blinders off of Adrian and leads to some very hot scenes! Once again, Adrian is beyond understanding in this area and when he finally confesses his true feelings to Sophia, sighworthy! My only small complaint about this book is there was no epilogue! I really felt like it needed one as a few threads were left dangling but maybe will we see this adventurous couple again in the future someday? I hope so because I feel like they have more stories to tell! If you are looking for a fact paced, sexy, smart adventure with a feisty, bold heroine and a hero who wants to protect her at all costs, many of them on a deeper level as the heroine is totally capable of taking care of herself physically, grab the newest from Shana Galen! You won't be disappointed! 5 starsI won an arc of Lord and Lady Spy from Ms Galen off of Twitter. Thanks!",
                    "This book was such a disappointment to me. The plot could have been really wonderful--I would love to read a good book about a couple driven apart by multiple miscarriages and her unwillingness to put herself through that again. I'm sure that was something that happened a lot (and still does) and should have created a powerful emotional plot without any farfetched story line. And while a bit too cute, the idea of a husband and wife discovering they were both being spies for the same group without realizing it could have been fun.But she didn't think it through at all. Why would a woman who was trying to look like a mindless society woman, feel the need to dress unattractively? if she felt that need, why would she then dress seductively to go to a midnight spying assignment? And would a husband and wife who are both stunned by realizing what their spouse has been up to immediately move to fighting about who was better and competing? wouldn't there have been a stage or two inbetween?These don't count as spoilers--they all probalby arose in the first 20 or 30 pages. The book just gets worse and worse from there. ",
                    "Adrian Galloway, Lord Smythe, and Sophia, Lady Smythe have been married for five years. Their marriage has been one of convenience between two titled families. Since the first day as husband and wife they've been working for the government. As spies. Without the other's knowledge. Adrian, agent Wolf and Sophia, agent Saint. With Bonaparte's surrender their services as spies for the Foreign Office are no longer needed. But when the prime minister, Lord Liverpool's half-brother is murdered, he asks the two newly-retired agents to take the case and bring the murderer to justice.Based obviously on the movie Mr and Mrs Smith this is nonetheless an entertaining and well-written historical romance. The premise of two spies married to one another in 1815 without the other's knowledge of their clandestine activities is a little over-the-top. But the execcution is clever, the story completely enjoyable and the romance delicious.There is plenty of sparkling and snarky repartee between Mr and Mrs Smythe. This is balanced out with some emotional depth in their growing romantic awareness and their dealing with the loss of their unborn babies through miscarriages. It's also quite a steamy little read as Adrian and Sophia fall in love for the first time.Of all the sub-genres of romance that I read I'd have to say historical romance is the one with an almost oversupply of talent and titles. Far too many new monthly releases that I'd like to read and can't. So I can understand why a talented author like Shana Galen is not as well-known. Which is a shame since she is a gifted writer of historical romance.Lord and Lady Spy is a really excellent romance and historical mystery by a very talented author and a highly recommended read.",
                    "This has taken me over a week to read, which perhaps speaks volumes. It was all a bit of a chore. Not enough to hold my attention, not bad enough for me to give up without knowing what was going to happen. This book is not aimed at me. I much prefer my romances true to the time in which they are set with a nicely developed couple at their centre and minimum dramaz. This was not like that how did it end up on my 'Want To Read' shelf? she wonders. Two Regency spies with secret identities who use the word 'operative' and are given a mission by the Prime Minister (not a fake one, but everyone's favourite 19th century PM, except Melbourne and Disraeli, Lord Liverpool). I did much historical pearl clutching whilst reading this book. But, I get that Galen's main aim is not historical accuracy (the book is called Lord and Lady Spy and is a direct and unashamed lift of the terrible film Mr and Mrs Smith) so I'm willing to shelve some of my complaints on that score. The story ticked along fine and was reasonably paced. The action scenes were quite good. What's a little unforgivable for me is the poor romance at the centre. I felt nothing for Adrian and Sophia. It all seemed to be based on insta-lust, there was no brilliant character interaction and as a consequence the sex was pretty disappointing too. All in all, this was a very mediocre experience for me, 2.5 stars. ",
                    "*Spoilers / Content Warning*...DNF 30% - It's not you, book. It's me.This book is a fun and seemingly fluffy Historical Romance Spy novel greatly inspired by the movie Mr. and Mrs. Smith. A core internal conflict centers on the couple attempting to cope with past miscarriages and present childlessness.There's a particularly impactful scene in which the heroine, Sophia, interacts with a visibly pregnant acquaintance. Just seeing the pregnant friend viscerally triggers her grief, pain, and jealousy and it's an intense moment. Very well crafted and it hits hard.At about a third of the way through the book I feel that even though the novel feels a little tonally disjointed at times, there's enough good here that I would return to read the book in the future. It's just not the book I need to be reading right now."

                    "Hmmmm a short and sweet average book with a smitten H who hasn't quite understood his level of smittenness and an in love h who walked away from him and her rich daddy because money ain't all that she wants to be loved. These 2 are sweet they had a cute romance that just involved a night of kissing and it's ruined him for all other women, he is just clueless as to why. They meet up 3 years later when she's a nanny for a princess (who has a child out of wedlock) and hop into bed together resulting in pregnancy, because as far more experienced reviewers than myself state in the HP rule book, If virgins have sex outside of the marriage bed then they are gonna end up with a bun in the oven. You think she would have learnt from her employer and used protection but nope! She'd done a flit on him during the night and left him to do a walk of shame through a palace - which he has no shame about - but it makes a change.Anyway she has to get in touch with him to tell him her news and he jumps at the opportunity to get her back - all without love avowals. Of course the lack of communication means everything goes Pete Tong and the royal wedding is off until they both admit their love on the wedding day that wasn't.Still - hope we see them again in the series with babies!",
                    "Maisey Yates cannot write a bad book in my opinion. Even with this novella which is a kind of prequel to the Santina Crown series and obviously written within a brief - she makes this an enjoyable read. It is nowhere near as good as other books she's written but it certainly is not bad. I truly do not understand those 1 star reviews! I know we can't all like the same stuff but I've read some absolute tosh in my time which I might give 1 star to on here (since I have never worked out how to do a zero or minus ranking), but Maisey Yates writing is so superior that it would never cross my mind just to give her one star. Still, chacun à son goût!! ",

                    "Sometimes it can be quite illuminating when you read the reviews for a book you've already finished reading. Especially the ones who give poor reviews. I can't help but wonder what they were expecting. Too short...yes it's a novella. Not enough character development...did I mention it was a novella? Too many tropes. Tropes...I thought that was to do with you know, a play on words, but now I find it is a sort of upmarket cliche. So there were cliche's in the story. Can you say series romance really really slowly. (Ok I'm giggling here. This is so much fun.) But seriously guys what were you expecting. This is a prequel for a gaggle of series romance stories. Cliche's will inevitably abound. But I happen to like cliche's when they are attached to a rather cute love story with a hot guy and a quirky heroine with a bit of personality. In fact I read this stuff because I like to know what I'm getting. Sure I'll give points for originality of plot lines or a nice varigation on the theme but a short story or novella doesn't leave a lot of room for playing. I want my men hot and my heroine's lovable and I like to know that whatever twists and turns I'm guaranteed a Happily Ever After. Now that's the biggest cliche of them all. And in case you are wondering, yes I love this story, every darned cliche/trope just made it the ideal comfort read. Almost as good as chocolate, but not quite, which is why it only got four stars.",
                    "For a freebie it goes up in value for me when there is no cliffhanger and it hasn't got one so yay. It is well written short novella, which means a quick read. You are not going to get earth shattering depths to the story but it did keep me entertained. More of a story than a sex scene so another bonus for me. Predictable yes but sometimes that's all you have time for so another bonus for me today. It's a good enough love story for me. Worth the read if you want that comfort reading material. ",
                    "Well, that was abrupt. You've got your patented Harlequin heroine who falls in love with a rich and broody man. You've got your sheik who knows how to do the heroine every which way til Sunday but doesn't know how to love. *Blink* Ooh, the story is done.",

                    "Novella length. Angelina Carpenter was set to marry Sheikh Taj Ahmad when she realized that she was a bargaining piece in a business merger and that Taj didn't really love her, even though she loved him. So she escaped, abandoned all connections and discovered her independence as a nanny for the Santina family. But she encounters Taj at a party and the attraction takes hold and they wind up in bed. And she ends up pregnant. She does the right thing and tells him, knowing that for the sake of his honor and reputation, she'll have to marry him and give up her independence forever. But in doing so, she'll tie herself to a man she never stopped loving and who claims he'll never be able to love her.So this was short and moved pretty quickly. It's fairly standard fare for the genre, with the one night stand pregnancy and having to do the marriage of convenience and the hero who believes he's incapable of love or whatever. But what really stood out here was how, all those reactions I always think should happen, actually do happen in this story. For example, when the hero sees the heroine for the first time, he asks, You traded your life, your future, as my queen to be a nanny? She shoots back with, No. I traded being your queen for some self-respect. Nice. I also liked how she was able to turn the tables on him, calling their one night together capitalizing on an opportunity when all she was to him earlier was an opportunity. It seems to even out the balance, as I do get so tired of those heroes who always seem to be able to claim superiority over the heroine or who at least get the best of them in verbal arguments (usually because the heroine is so lust-addled that her brain has turned to goo.) Instead, when the hero attempts the seduction routine and the heroine says no, he does the your body would suggest otherwise and she comes back with My body isn't running the show. My mind is. Correct answer Angelina, nice job! No lust-addled goo for brains here. This story was by no means perfect and was still fairly cliche in a lot of ways, but just by virtue of some of these responses from a strong, self-respecting heroine, this earns its stars. Also - major kudos for a hero who managed to stay celibate during a 3 year separation from the heroine! Wow! And he didn't even realize he loved her yet."

Up against forces she can barely grasp and a powerful research facility, Hallie is helped by the local Deputy, Boyd Davies, who has his own secrets.There is so much to like about this fantasy. The plot and the setting in contemporary South Dakota were really exceptional. Combining a fantasy and magic with a mystery in the rural plains of South Dakota were wonderfully creative. The lightning, storms and fires were atmospheric, written with a fertile imagination.It's a shame that the characterisation of the heroine grated so much. The heroine's personality could at best be described as prickly. Also moody, angry and crass would do. A tough, independent heroine is good but you don’t want her to come off as so hard-boiled as to be unlikable.The hero, Boyd is described as thin, more bone than flesh and pretty and looking so, so young which I find a little unappealing in a male lead. He is earnest and all spit and polish, a neat-freak. Since this is about every thing opposite to what I find attractive in a man, I found it difficult to regard him as hero material. His personality though, was appealing and won me over somewhat. Without at least some investment in the main characters, the book as a whole fell short, regardless of how thoroughly enjoyable the actual plot was. The writing was a little difficult to follow at times and there were some odd phrases.Though the plot was resolved, Hallie still has some unfinished business with ghosts. The relationship between Hallie and Boyd was very romance-lite, which may be developed further in the next book. I'll reiterate that there was a lot to enjoy in Wide Open. The setting and the plot may make this an enjoyable read if you can put up with an unlikable heroine.Steam: 1.5",
                    "There were aspects of this book that I liked, like how tough, uncompromising and at times unrelational the heroine, Hallie could be and how that all made sense given where she had come from. He back-story was one of the few really thought out parts of a story that read as written in a hurried way.For starters, while it passed the Bechdel test (a named female at times conversed with a named female not about men) it almost seemed to be trying to hurriedly get that qualification over with so it could return to the real point of the story which was quite a tedious romance with a baby-faced (but in fact the correct cliche bit older than the heroine) boy scout mensch. Boyd was too good to be true and a bit sickening, he kept turning up all the time and Hallie's irritation with him was (surprise, surprise) tinged with desire...but at least he never crossed boundaries or forced himself on her.The actual physical reality of the romance in the story was fairly light, reverse cliche (she suddenly out of nowhere grabs him) and even that main story was underdeveloped as was the paranormal aspect of the story. The ghosts were excellent and had more going for them than most of the living characters but the bad guy's vague connection to a naughty granny seemed like lazy vagueness rather than the intriguing enigma we were possible meant to take it as.The ending left an awful lot to be desired.If you like romance and don,t mind a paranormal element then this at least has a genuinely strong heroine and a genuinely respectful while capable hero. It's a light and easy read, a good plot which is only frustrating in what seemed like unrealised potential, in how much better the same concept could have been with a slight departure from the determined political neutrality of the book and the light fluffiness that made the grit and toughness unconvincing within the story.I didn't hate it, I would consider giving this author another chance to mildly entertain me.

                    "Deborah Coates debut novel Wide Open is written with a spare elegant style, uncomplicated, purposeful prose much like her protagonist Hallie Michaels. Its a story about the intersection of life and death, power and sacrifice, self realization and stubbornness. Its a modern fantasy, a mystery and a ghost story. Its very good.Hallie has returned to South Dakota on a 10 day leave from her army posting in Afghanistan because her sister Dell has died in what seems to be a one person car accident. Knowing the woman, Hallie does not accept the official version and starts investigating. It soon becomes clear that there are odd doings at a local wind turbine research facility run by a man Dell and Hallie knew in high school, Martin Weber and invested in by Pete, a local bad boy.Meanwhile, Hallie has to come to grips with the odd circumstances of her own life. While in Afghanistan, just a few short weeks ago, her Humvee was blown up and Hallie was dead for several minutes. Since then, she can see ghosts. They ride with her, and although they do not talk they give her clues. We soon find that if Hallie solves the mystery of the ghost's presence in her life, it will leave.As Hallie counts down the days to her return to active duty, she starts to understand her new found abilities and soon comes under increasing pressure from Pete and Martin Weber. Weber has harnessed the power of lighting and weather to do his bidding but the source of his power is old fashioned dark magic and unwilling sacrifices and its up to Hallie and her new found and barely learned powers and her increasing ability to tap into the ghosts to stop him.",
                    "Hallie Michaels, a soldier in Afghanistan, is sent home to Prairie City, South Dakota, for ten days of compassionate leave when her sister Dell dies in a car accident. Rumor has it Dell committed suicide, but Hallie doesn’t buy it. And since her own recent brush with death in the war, Hallie can see ghosts, including Dell’s. Hallie is determined to find out why Dell really died and enable her sister to find peace — and she’s only got ten days to do it.Hallie is a fantastic protagonist: sympathetic yet flawed, honorable but full of jagged edges. She is thrust back into the civilian world at the beginning of Wide Open and finds that she’s just not used to it anymore. Her temper burns a little too hot. She is annoyed when friends do things that would be foolish in the war zone, such as when her friend Brett moves too slowly. She’s not sure she remembers, anymore, how to navigate the rituals of small-town small talk. Deborah Coates uses lots of little touches like this to bring Hallie to life in three dimensions.Prairie City is as complex as the woman returning to it. I had a few reservations going into Wide Open, I was worried it would turn out to be one of the “cute quaint small town” books where a heroine returns to her hometown and realizes that it’s perfect and all other ways of life are miserable by comparison. That’s simply not a genre that does much for me. But that’s not what Coates does. Prairie City has its good points and its flaws, like any real place, it’s this balance that makes it feel like a real place. There’s a lot of human warmth in Prairie City (though it’s often hidden under a layer of stoicism), the place has a desolate beauty, and it’s easy to see why someone could love living there. At the same time, it can be oppressive. It’s a place where everyone has history with everyone else, and all the baggage that comes with that, and you don’t get the friendliest of reactions if you question the company that’s bringing in the jobs.As for the paranormal elements, Hallie soon learns that her ghosts aren’t the only weirdness in town. Dell’s death is connected to a sinister figure who’s using the supernatural for his own ends. The extent of the villain’s powers is sometimes hazy, which can be both good and bad. Sometimes I found myself wondering why he wasn’t doing anything worse to stop Hallie than what he was actually doing (which, granted, was pretty bad already). But at other times he’d turn out to have more power than I thought, which made for great scares, there’s one in particular that made me say “Oh, holy crap” aloud because it was something much bigger than I’d thought he was capable of. And an explanation does emerge, later, for why Hallie is not attacked more directly by these powers.One more thing about the ghosts: there’s one ghost in Wide Open who has nothing to do with the mystery of Dell’s death, but who is intimately involved in my very favorite scene of the book. It brought me to tears. It concerns one of Hallie’s fellow soldiers, who died in Afghanistan and left behind a grieving fiancée. The scene where Hallie deals with his plight is simply wonderful.There’s a touch of romance in Wide Open, but it does not overwhelm the other aspects of the plot. Hallie’s suitor is another layered character, his love of order stems from a deep-seated fear of chaos. Both characters are prickly and so it’s a slow courtship, but a realistic one devoid of “insta-love” annoyances.Wide Open’s plot is self-contained and is satisfactorily wrapped up by the end, but the very last scene opens the door for further stories. Deborah Coates has impressed me with this first novel, and I will definitely be on the lookout for more.",
                    "As it happens -- just so this is all out in the open and everything -- Deb and I have the same agent, and I’ve met Deb a couple of times, and hey! She’s a dog person! She actually owns a GERMAN PINSCHER. You know nobody just stumbles into owning a German Pinscher. You have to be a real dog person to even know they exist. Naturally I wanted to love her book!Whew! Because I did. WIDE OPEN’s being marketed as an urban fantasy — well, contemporary, because it sure isn’t urban — or a paranormal, and of course that’s no surprise because paranormal is so hot hot hot right now, but this one really isn’t very paranormal-ish. The romance is not central enough and it’s not woman-with-psychic-powers-meets-super-hottie anyway. Instead, the main character, Hallie, is recently bereaved (her sister has just died), grieving, angry, and pretty well hair-triggered — I liked her very much. And the romantic lead? He gets called “The Boy Deputy” by everyone in town because he’s so baby-faced. (Hilarious!)And my favorite secondary character? Hallie’s father. Talk about the strong silent type, emphasis on the silent. I mean, here’s a line I just loved:. . . while women organized the kitchen or the laundry or feed for the horses and men walked across the fields, looking for her father so they could lean against fences and never say a word.Isn’t that great? I love the relationship between Hallie and her dad — I really look forward to seeing that subtle relationship develop in the next book (this one’s self contained but there will be at least two more).And the setting! I’m SUCH a sucker for setting! South Dakota! Who sets a book in Big Sky country? I mean, other than westerns, and they’re not contemporary. LOVED the setting. Deb caught it just so well, it’s a real You Are There setting. Excellent dialogue, too, which I really admire. Deb really captured the clumsy stumbling dialogue that really happens in charged, intense situations. Like here, where Hallie calls a dead man’s fiancee to tell her about his death, and the fiancee says:“He was the only guy I ever dated,” she said. “Because I’m not — No one ever — I’m not pretty,” she stated flatly. “It was a blind date that first time. My cousin fixed us up. And it was so embarrassing and kind of awful, but he was sweet about it, you know? I didn’t thnk he’d call, but he did — the next day even. And I liked him. I — he was the best guy. But I never knew, I couldn’t ask him, because why? Why would he go out with me? I don’t understand.”I just loved that scene. It’s not an important scene, but it works really really well. And that’s typical.So the identity of the bad guy is obvious and the bad guy himself is pretty ho-hum, for me anyway, but it’s the rest of the story which makes this book.So I wouldn’t recommend this one to my mother, because one cuss word and she’s done with a book, you have no idea, but if that doesn’t bother you the way it does her, then hey! Ghosts, South Dakota, excellent characters, great dialogue, good solid writing — if that sounds like you, you might keep an eye out for this one.",
                    "You may also read my review here: http://www.mybookishways.com/2012/03/...I love discovering new authors, and I especially love it when I discover one that will go on my autobuy. You know the feeling I’m talking about, where in the first few pages you know you’re really gonna like a book? That’s how I felt with Wide Open. Wide Open is Hallie Michaels’ story, and right away, you know you’re in for something unique. It begins when Hallie returns to South Dakota from Afghanistan to attend her sister Dell’s funeral. To hear the town tell it, Dell committed suicide, but Hallie knows better, and is determined to get to the bottom of it. With the help of her childhood friend, and Boyd, a sheriff’s deputy that has the same suspicions as Hallie, she’ll have to navigate some unusual, and possibly life threatening territory to find out the truth of her sister’s death. And there’s a storm coming…Right away, the author plops you right down into the near stifling atmosphere of (rather stormy) small town South Dakota, and doesn’t let up on you. Hallie is a little more than normal, since she “died” in Afghanistan, was revived, and can now see ghosts on a near constant basis. One of them is Dell. The author manages to make the ghosts creepy and haunting without making them scary, and they’re not malicious, but they do want something of Hallie. She’s got 10 days to figure out what happened to her sister, and as it turns out, other women in the area that have gone missing. It may have something to do with Uku-Weber, and it’s founder Martin Weber, but Hallie’s not quite sure what. The company seemingly gets raves from the community, with its creation of new jobs and research into harnessing wind energy, but there’s something more diabolical going on, something involving magic, and possibly murder.There are plenty of supernatural components in Wide Open for readers of fantasy, but the real magic lies in the characters. Hallie is moody and brittle much of the time, but we see her soften over the course of the novel, especially when it comes to Boyd. He’s determined to help Hallie, and she’s determined to push him away, and the almost-romance is actually kind of sweet (and it leaves plenty of good stuff for a next novel, maybe? Hopefully?) The writer’s staccato writing style served the story well, and her grasp on small town life is fascinating, plus there’s murder, magic, fire, and ghosts. How can you go wrong with that? Wide Open was a quick read for me, but that’s because I really didn’t want to put it down for long, and is a great debut fantasy. I have my fingers crossed for more Hallie and Boyd, but I’d be happy with anything from Deborah Coates. I urge you to give this one a try!",
                    "When I was invited to participate in the blog tour for Deborah Coates’ debut WIDE OPEN, I didn’t know what to expect. I hadn’t heard much (anything) about this book before I received the synopsis in my email. Well, it called to me and told me, “Read this book!” The plot, the setting, the ideas – the synopsis is really good in so many ways. I heartily accepted Tor’s offer and received my copy of WIDE OPEN and dove in.WIDE OPEN is the story of young soldier Hallie, a South Dakota native who has come home on bereavement leave after the death of her sister Dell. The police think Dell committed suicide, but Hallie disagrees. The fact that she sees her sister’s ghost – among others – just makes her that much more desperate to investigate what really happened to her sister. What she finds out is something that involves ancient powers, disappearances, and a company with sinister intentions. Along with sheriff’s deputy Boyd, Hallie ends up being the only person who can stop things before they hurt more people.I admit, I am somewhat conflicted about this story. I think the biggest problem I had was with the main character, Hallie. She was almost insufferable. Not only is she rude and brash to the people in her life, but she keeps everyone – including the reader – away, keeping her arms crossed and her mind closed. Likewise, I think the characterization in the story was somewhat off, comprising multiple characters that seemed only like a semblance of a person. Even Boyd seemed slightly off. But Hallie was by far the worst character, and the one that almost prevented me from getting into the story.But the story… The plot is great, the setting is amazing, and the author’s vivid description of the South Dakota prairies is thrilling. I might want to vacation there now! Mount Rushmore, that place they mentioned in Jurassic Park… Even though there were some clunky sentences that could use refinement (trust me, Deborah Coates has a great future ahead of her with her writing style), the book’s prose was tight and clean. The contemporary setting with family drama mixed with mystery and fantastical elements was such a wonderful change from the explicitly paranormal or explicitly contemporary. Being used to having one or the other, never both, I really enjoyed the way Coates’ mixed them into a compelling story.Once you get past a slow build and unraveling of the story, the ending is thrilling and worth the wait. WIDE OPEN is not a novel for everyone, but if you can get into the story and past the prickly character, this is definitely a novel full of intrigue and excitement that you’ll want to pick up.VERDICT: Although beleaguered by a nasty protagonist, WIDE OPEN is a book with great writing, unique setting, and wonderful details. Check this one out!",
                    "Hmmm. So this is one of those books that I was enjoying well enough one day, but when I picked it up the next, it no longer worked for me.I liked some of it. I liked the premise of the series. I liked the genuine good guy love interest. But I got tired of all the awkward dialogue. It's deliberately awkward, but I got tired of all the stumbling over words and failing to say important things.And while I liked that the supernatural premise of the series isn't quite explained, I didn't like that plot remained fairly unexplained, too. I wanted more concrete details."

The plot was different enough that it wasn’t a complete copy but too much duo for my taste. Disappointing really, but still somewhat enjoyable. While it was repetitive it was still a nice read through murder the best in the series. Luke’s mistakes were cliche to me and I wish that the author hasn’t made them what they were but that may just be me.The writing was a little weak and some parts could have been reworked to be stronger in all it was a timid book.

I don't really expect much of this series other than to entertain, give me some sighable romantic moments and perhaps teach a few thought-worthy christian principles. The first two delivered as promised. However, the resolution in Return was just a little too quick and pat for me. Towards the end of the book every conversation was one that the characters had already had at least two or three times before. And I really couldn't get past a particularly annoying product placement reference. Were Kingsbury and Smalley getting some travel perks from priceline.com?

                    "One reason I don't read serial novels (or watch the show Lost) is that as they progress, the plots become increasingly convoluted in order to keep the reader engaged in the story and turning the pages. So I'm not going to read the other two books in this series because the events and circumstances that take place in this family are looking less like every-day life. Where the first book began with one uncomplicated yet heartbreaking plot twist, this book leaves off with a number of inexplicable open ends. And despite their flaws, the characters are still too perfect--especially the men (Ryan Taylor, Landon Blake). They are like fairy-tale princes. They are always there to say the right thing, never use irony or sarcasm, and even remember to put coasters down under their water glasses. Kingsbury's prose becomes a little lazy by this book, too. She relies too heavily upon cliches and dead phrases such as a piece of her heart was missing, his thoughts swirled around him like a whirlwind, etc. I feel a bit like that kid in the Princess Bride (Woah, woah, woah--is this a kissing book?) because of all the descriptions of Landon's kisses and how filled they are with passion, longing, tenderness, love, trust. Blegh. Stop now, please. So why give it four stars? Because it is a page-turner, and I appreciate what Kingsbury is trying to do. She wants to show God's faithfulness in peoples' lives. I would have preferred a single novel, however, a smaller story that revolved around a few people and showed them with greater depth instead of a large web of characters whose lives intersect in increasingly ridiculous ways.

                    "From the New York Times bestselling author of On Mystic Lake comes a powerful novel of love, loss, and the magic of friendship. . . .In the turbulent summer of 1974, Kate Mularkey has accepted her place at the bottom of the eighth-grade social food chain. Then, to her amazement, the “coolest girl in the world” moves in across the street and wants to be her friend. Tully Hart seems to have it all---beauty, brains, ambition. On the surface they are as opposite as two people can be: Kate, doomed to be forever uncool, with a loving family who mortifies her at every turn. Tully, steeped in glamour and mystery, but with a secret that is destroying her. They make a pact to be best friends forever; by summer’s end they’ve become TullyandKate. Inseparable.So begins Kristin Hannah’s magnificent new novel. Spanning more than three decades and playing out across the ever-changing face of the Pacific Northwest, Firefly Lane is the poignant, powerful story of two women and the friendship that becomes the bulkhead of their lives.From the beginning, Tully is desperate to prove her worth to the world. Abandoned by her mother at an early age, she longs to be loved unconditionally. In the glittering, big-hair era of the eighties, she looks to men to fill the void in her soul. But in the buttoned-down nineties, it is television news that captivates her. She will follow her own blind ambition to New York and around the globe, finding fame and success . . . and loneliness. Kate knows early on that her life will be nothing special. Throughout college, she pretends to be driven by a need for success, but all she really wants is to fall in love and have children and live an ordinary life. In her own quiet way, Kate is as driven as Tully. What she doesn’t know is how being a wife and mother will change her . . . how she’ll lose sight of who she once was, and what she once wanted. And how much she’ll envy her famous best friend. . . .For thirty years, Tully and Kate buoy each other through life, weathering the storms of friendship---jealousy, anger, hurt, resentment. They think they’ve survived it all until a single act of betrayal tears them apart . . . and puts their courage and friendship to the ultimate test.Firefly Lane is for anyone who ever drank Boone’s Farm apple wine while listening to Abba or Fleetwood Mac. More than a coming-of-age novel, it’s the story of a generation of women who were both blessed and cursed by choices. It’s about promises and secrets and betrayals. And ultimately, about the one person who really, truly knows you---and knows what has the power to hurt you . . . and heal you. Firefly Lane is a story you’ll never forget . . . one you’ll want to pass on to your best friend."

                    "This book was such a disappointment. The characters were completely one dimensional and not at all interesting. The storyline was filled with cliches from every bad Lifetime movie. About three quarters of the way through, I somehow knew how it would end (because it was the one cliche that hadn't been hit yet). The book itself is primarily dialouge and not good one at that. Avoid."

                    "Oh.My.God. This book deserves more than five stars, in fact, it deserves every single star in the sky. This book was phenomenal. It tugged at my heart strings in the best of ways. I laughed and I cried.. Oh, how I cried.  You will need a box of tissues, handy! This book is about friendship. Although, in my opinion, the word “friendship” doesn’t seem like a big enough word to encapsulate their relationship. They were simply: TullyandKate. Best friends forever. This book began in the 1970’s and went straight through the Millenium. The reader was able to see both Tully and Kate come of age. Kate had everything Tully wanted: a family. And Tully, had everything Kate wanted: she was drop dead gorgeous and popular. While Tully wanted a family and Kate wanted to have Tully’s charm and good looks, as a duo, they were enough. They completed each other. They made each other whole In my opinion, what makes a book great is character development. I like to go on a journey with the characters, I like to see them grow, come into their own. Kristen Hannah gave that to me, and more. I also value characters that I can relate to. When I was in high school, I could easily see Kate and Tully walking arm-in-arm down the hallway. In college, I could visualize them walking across my campus. This book made my heart sing and it made my heart ache.. and yet at the end, I wanted more. I’m going to go out on a limb and say that this is one of the best books I’ve ever read. Thankfully, there is a sequel. Thank you Ms. Hannah!",
                    "Speechless.. Wow...I loved this so much. ❤️ Kristin Hannah give me my heart back. She tore it out, shattered it into a million pieces and then stomped on it. Yet I can't wait to come back for more with Fly Away! What did I love about this book? Every single thing. I loved how the author captured that time in young adulthood when your BFF is your whole world. Where you do everything together and practically are one. This feeling was so real that I imagined myself as the third wheel with Tully and Kate biking down Firefly Lane way after curfew. You could just smell the air and the grass and it was so real.Ahhhh...that music! All the songs that the chapters were titled after...I loved it! It was like a trip down memory lane. I found myself humming along as I flipped the pages. Every song I would say to myself, wow I forgot about that one but I loved it! You know how a song can take you back? Yes well it did!This was my first book by this author. Her writing style literally blew me away. I now understand what all the hype is about. I can't wait to continue on with this story with Fly Away. Thank you Susan for doing a buddy read with me! It was such a great book to chat with someone about.",
                    "This was the first Kristen Hannah book I read and it's about two girls who become friends in middle school in the 70's and it follows them through their lives. I really enjoyed the writing, I think Hannah is really good at telling stories because I kept wanting to read on. The characters were all complex and made the book feel real. The ending was not that great though and I can agree that some of the plot was derivative but I don't think there's anything wrong with using things in your book that have been done if you do them well, which I think Hannah does.",
                    "Read years ago when the book was released!Read Stephanie's review...it's beautiful!!!I was deeply moved - surprised I liked it so much ---mailed it to my sister. She loved it just as much.I immediately read one more book, by Kristen Hannah...but when it didn't 'wow' me..I didn't continuing reading more of Hannah's books - but FIREFLY...has a very authentic feeling to it - not pushed - not overly schmaltzy.Sincerely touching!Read Stephanie's great review!!!"

                    "This is the first Regina Scott story I’ve read. It’s also the first Love Inspired novel I’ve read in a very long time! It was wonderful! I’ve been reading Regency romance lately and was searching my shelves when it dawned on me that I have a TON of Love Inspired Regency novels that I haven’t read!! I’m so glad I came across this gem of an author! I can’t wait to read the rest of the series as well as other series by her! This story is set in Spring 1805, England. Three young Rogues who think they are their uncle’s heirs to the Barony descend upon their young, newly discovered cousin eager to find proof that SHE is a fraud and couldn’t possibly be the rival heir to the estate. As they become acquainted with their adorable and mischievous 16 year old cousin and her enchanting governess, what ensues is mystery, intrigue, danger, secrets, and surprisingly also romance! I enjoyed this story very much!",
                    "So, I ended up liking this one a lot more than I thought I would. It was a fun regency with a mystery woven in. I had accidently started the second book first, but soon realized that this is one series you would want to read in order. I think each book focuses on a different couple, but there is an overlapping story and mystery throughout the series. I liked our main characters Jerome and Adele, I thought they had a nice relationship. I think I liked that even though Adele had some hard times in her past, she stayed true to herself. I would have liked a little more information about her past relationship, but maybe that will come out in other books. I guess I wanted a confrontation of some kind with the man who had wronged her. I thought that she had a good relationship with Jerome, although  in the real world I think falling in love and marrying within a week is WAY too soon. But, in the fiction world and the time period I found it believable.  I though the Christian elements were pretty mild, didn’t seem overly preachy. But, all the praying and stuff was in italics and I usually skipped over the preachy stuff anyway. I thought it was a fun start to a new series. I look forward to reading the rest of the books. Content: Clean. Reading Order:Book One: The Rogue’s ReformBook Two: The Captain’s CourtshipBook Three: The Rakes RedemptionBook Four: The Heiress Homecoming ",
                    "This was a well written book, with many secrets that are difficult to figure out. This had a lot more plot then other regency romances I have read lately and it was very refreshing. There is a Christian theme to the book, but it is in no way preachy. I really enjoyed getting to know these characters and will continue to read about them in the next two books. Very clean.",
                    " I was sent an advance copy of this book in exchange for my review. This review will be unbiased.Jerome Everard has worked his whole life to ensure that his legacy, his Uncle Arthur's estate, should prosper while Uncle Arthur was content to float through life enjoying himself with London pleasures. Now Uncle Arthur is dead and his solicitor reveals shocking news: Jerome is not the heir after all! Uncle Arthur has a secret daughter and the title and the estate pass to her from her father. Jerome will only inherit a minor estate and only after his cousin has a successful season with three offers of marriage and her governess's approval. Jerome heads off to Cumberland accompanied by his dashing brother Richard and his roguish cousin Vaughn to charm the governess into revealing the truth and expose their so-called cousin as a fraud. Jerome expects to find a scheming jade and her greedy governess, but instead he finds a young lady badly in need of comfort and a remarkable woman who stands as her friend. Adele Walcott, Samantha Everard's governess, is 27 and had her share of difficulties. She has been managing the Everard estate for the last ten years and she is determined to protect her cousin from the rogues who appear unannounced on her doorstep. Yet, as she watches Jerome go about estate business she starts to admire the serious, dedicated young man. The more Jerome gets to know his lively young cousin and her remarkable friend, he begins to feel protective towards the ladies and perhaps even something more for the lovely Adele. Adele once loved and lost and felt the light go out of her life. She has found a new Light to guide her yet she still remains cynical. As Jerome and Adele become close, someone seeks to separate them and will stop at nothing to achieve their aims. Adele must decide who to believe in and trust in her Lord to guide her and show her the way to truth and happiness. Before I share my opinion, I must begin by saying this book is the most Christian of all three of Regina Scott's Love Inspired books so far. It is not as easy to gloss over the Bible passages and prayers in this novel as it is in the other two. If you don't believe in Adele's God, then you probably won't want to read this book. If you do want to read this book, read on. As usual Regina Scott excels at creating a wholly original story in a genre in which many authors borrow plots from Jane Austen, Georgette Heyer and each other and toss in cliche after cliche. The characters are well-developed and are kept from becoming stock characters by Regina's excellent characterizations. Jerome is a nice hero but a bit too serious. He's on a mission which could be interpreted as caddish but he has good reasons for it and he grows and changes throughout the story. Adele is the weak link. She's a typical redoubtable spinster, capable of handling everything that comes her way calmly. Yet she's also more well-drawn than many Regency novel heroines. She has doubts and fears yet she isn't afraid to trust her heart. She could use a bit more of a temper to make her a bit more human but I quite like her, aside from her reliance on God to guide her way. I quite like Vaughn and I expect I shall entirely lose my heart to him once he has his own story. I also really liked Samantha who at times seems spoiled and childish but also has backbone and a good sense of humor. I look forward to seeing her grow up. The plot was interesting enough to keep me reading but dragged on a bit in the last third of the novel. My only major criticisms are that the mystery of Samantha's mother is easy to figure out and the romance happens a bit too quickly for me to believe. Finally, my biggest complaint is that since this book is the first in a series, the big mystery is yet to be resolved and I hate waiting!!! Overall, it's a good book but not as good as Regina Scott's older non-Inspirational books, but that's my personal opinion and I would recommend that those who like the Regency genre and don't mind Inspirational Regencies give this one a try.",
                    "Was my review helpful? If so, please click yes on Amazon. Thanks!The Rogue's Reform, book one in Regina Scott's The Everard Legacy, was such an interesting, enjoyable, and (at times) humorous read.As I read The Rogue's Reform I found myself really liking the characters. My favorites were: Jerome, Adele, Vaughn, and Adele's mother.I didn't really expect there to be a little mystery/suspense in The Rogue's Reform, but there was! There was even attempted murder, which (in my opinion) added a little who-done-it to the story, making it even more of a great read!A few things are left unanswered at the end of The Rogue's Reform making me want to read the next book in Regina's series, The Captain's Courtship, which released this month. Plus, I've grown to really like the characters and want to see what happens next in their lives.Overall, I really enjoyed The Rogue's Reform and recommend it if you like historical reads with romance. It's great.*I received this book from the author for my honest review. I was not required to give a positive review, only my honest opinion - which I've done. All thoughts and opinions expressed are my own.*",
                    "This was a different sort of book for me, while I have read many historical romances and several modern books in the Love Inspired series, this is the first one I have read in the Regency period with religious overtones. It works! The author did not use religion to disrupt the plot, it felt very natural. I will be on the lookout for other books in this series. ",
                    "Entertaining. Some mystery and a cliffhanger and some unlikely scenarios. I'll continue reading the series to see what happens.",
                    "Meh. I started out liking it but it was sort of a chore to make it to the end of this book. Scott’s style in this book is similar to Lawana Blackwell’s but I just couldn’t connect with the characters."

At all. I was reading, reading and reading and turning the pages I had a feeling of deja vu: it was always the same words, the same situations, rehearsal, rehearsal, rehearsal, shoe factory, wedding, wedding, wedding... And then I have found myself to skip, first passages and then the whole pages and didn't feel that I miss on something. I have expected so much. The idea itself was really interesting and I hoped the quest will be soooo exciting. Unfortunately, what I go is just cliche, ideas that I could think about with my little brain and not a lot of imagination. I have hoped for fireworks and unexpected situations but unfortunately didn't get anything. Was it really searching? Looking for this guy? I guess it book could have half of the pages that it has.It would be 1 star but the end was teeny tiny better as the whole book itself.I am really sorry that this book didn't work for me. Really.",

As I continued to read, it felt like I was just turning the pages and nothing good was happening. I didn't enjoy the read because it was just so boring until the last 10 pages where basically everything good happened. So I was so disappointed. I just kept telling everyone, this is the worst book ever. Her journey throughout is touching and cute, but nothing special. So I don't recommend this unless you like to be bored."

                    "This Regency won a year 2000 RITA award. It had wit and serious issues too. Our story featured rake Beecham (called Bryce) &amp,earl's sister Lady Jemima. Both appeared on the scene after a murder on Bryce's land. Jemima comforted ayoung, flighty actress who witnessed the murder. Bryce displayed sarcasm &amp, innuendo in his exchanges w/ Jem. Jem intrigued Bryce who found her spirited, intelligent and attractive (IE tall and 'nicely rounded.') He chided her about her age. She rebuffed his hallow flattery about her beauty. Jemima devoted her life to her selfish brother, popularpoet, Terrance, Lord Troy. She overheard Troy describe her to Bryce She's never any trouble. Follows where I lead, just like a faithful hound (25% mark). Bryce regretted some of his past unseemly behavior. Slowly, he tired of his rake status and struggled with how to change? Should he change? The author treated readers to snappy and clever dialogue. Ms Butler explored the circumstances &amp, context of the murder. Jem made some unfounded conclusions before the end, which made me deduct 1 star. I enjoyed this couple's journey to love.",
                    "Bryce is the crowning hero of the book, and its central character, in spite of the greater scenes with Jemina. His story is well flushed out, and one can see how he came to fall in love. Unfortunately, Jemina is not so smart in my book and didn't trust the hero to boot, after all he's done for her, but she does commit herself to a noble act which nicely redeems her in the end. In any case, the mystery is decent, though somewhat rushed at the end. I so loved how the most notorious libertine's stories have been explained - his wish to go into the Church, how his scandalous exploits weren't exactly of his doing, and most of all his irrefutable honor in the face of great adversity. Bravo to Bryce!",
                    "A- / 4.5 stars rounded up.Read for the 2021 TBR Challenge prompt for January - Comfort Read.I generally think of a comfort read as something I’ve already read, but because I try to choose my TBR Challenge reads from books I haven’t read, I decided to go for one by an author whose work I’ve enjoyed and want to read more of.xa0 Nancy Butler’s The Rake’s Retreat got my 2021 TBR Challenge off to a great start, it makes excellent use of the trope of the-rake-who-falls-hard-for-a -spinster-ish-heroine, and it contains some of the best verbal sparring I’ve ever come across.xa0 The romance is wonderful, the chemistry between the leads is off the charts and their relationship is superbly written, with lots of insight, tenderness and mutual understanding on display amid the banter and the delicious sexual tension.The Rake’s Retreat opens when seventeen-year-old travelling player Lovelace Wellesley, leading lady of Wellesley’s Wandering Minstrels, witnesses a murder in the Kentish countryside.xa0 Unfortunately for her, the murderer sees her, and she flees in fear of her life – but in the way of all heroines-in-perilxa0 - she falls and turns her ankle.xa0 Fortunately for her, she is rescued by the local landowner, Beecham Bryce, who is obviously sceptical of her story of murder, but who decides to accompany her to the (supposed) scene of the crime so that, if nothing else, he can convince her that she is in no danger.Lady Jemima Vale is visiting Kent with her brother Lord Troy, London’s premier playwright, and is spending the afternoon sketching while she waits for him to return to the inn at which they are staying.xa0 Her solitude is interrupted when she is approached by a starkly attractive gentleman who asks if she’s seen anyone in the woods.xa0 Oddly unsettled by the stranger, whose easy grace, aura of danger and sudden, surprisingly engaging smile do odd things to her knees, Jemima replies that she has not seen anyone - and he explains that his young companion claims to have witnessed a murder in the woods just half an hour before. xa0He looks around for a while and finds nothing – but when Jemima gets to her feet shortly afterwards, he notices the blood-stains on her dress and realises she must have been sitting in the very spot the murder took place.xa0 Lovelace may well be in danger after all, and Jemima is all for going back to the inn and returning her to her family – but the Minstrels have departed, mistakenly believing Lovelace to have been asleep in one of their carts.xa0 Bryce suggests she should stay at his home while he arranges for someone to find her parents, but Jemima is horrified at the suggestion, leave a lovely young woman alone with a notorious rake?xa0 Unthinkable!xa0 Bryce - who has taken quite a shine to the tall, long-limbed brunette who challenges him at every turn and responds to his flirtatious teasing with a haughtily raised brow and a sharp retort – sees his chance, and suggests that Jemima should avail herself of his hospitality as well… to act as chaperone to Lovelace of course.Over the next few days, Bryce and Jemima find themselves spending a lot of time together, sometimes in easy companionship, sometimes shooting verbal arrows at each other, both of them clearly having the other’s measure, both of them at something of a crossroads in life.xa0 Jemima is firmly on the shelf and approaching her thirtieth birthday, she is starting to take stock of her life – most of which she has spent at her brother’s beck and call – and realising that she’s missed out on having a life of her own.xa0 The artistic and literary salons she hosts in London may have provided intellectual stimulation, but she has neglected her emotional life and longs for something different.xa0 Bryce is a swoonworthy hero, witty, sexy and insightful, he’s a man of intelligence and compassion hiding behind a mask of ennui and innuendo, and has returned to the family home in Kent in order to take care of it while his father – with whom he doesn’t get on - xa0is on a six-month long visit to warmer climes for his health.xa0 Bryce is a womaniser and a libertine and makes no apologies for it, but he’s also quick to see and understand Jemima’s frustrations and to encourage her to step out from her brother’s shadow.xa0 He sees Jemima for who she truly is, and he falls hard, although he does end up torn between wanting her and wanting what (he thinks) is best for her, which means his behaviour is sometimes a little hurtful as he tries to push her away ‘for her own good.’But there is never any doubt in the reader’s mind that they’re perfect for one another.xa0 The author shows over and over again, through their words and actions, through the sparkling dialogue and verbal sparring, that they’re a match in wit and intellect, and that they belong together.The mystery is interesting, although it’s fairly easy to guess where it’s going, but it’s nicely done all the same, and Lovelace makes for an engaging secondary character who, while she starts off being rather self-obsessed and a bit whiny, exhibits substantial character growth throughout the story.xa0 There’s another character who provides considerable insight into Bryce’s character, showing him to be a deeply caring, loving person (and who has an important part to play in the story) but I can’t reveal more without spoilers.When AAR reviewed this title back in 1999, it was awarded DIK status, and I’d say it’s worn pretty well and still deserves that grade (A-).xa0 It’s not a straight A because I wasn’t wild about the way Jemima so easily distrusted Bryce towards the end, and some behaviour that veered a bit too close to TSTL territory – but those are minor irritants when set against all the things this book does so incredibly well, which is pretty much everything else.The Rake’s Retreat is a fabulous, witty and charming romance that has definitely stood the test of time. I highly recommend it.",
                    "Nice read with interesting plot and writing.Up to about 70% book was a 5 star read, last 30% was rushed, unbelievable and cliched.Hero is very interesting and has good growth, he grows from a reprobate to proper hero. Heroine was wonderful in the beginning but grows to be a foolish lady towards end.After the way hero behaved and trusted heroine, when it came for her to trust him she failed miserably and proved hero’s sentiments about live is true. That part felt to be too much melodrama and not in synch with heroine’s character.Final mystery was solved but in a rushed manner and the way heroine trusted villain also than hero was meh 😑 I didn’t like the ending, felt heroine should have apologized for her reckless and stupid behavior. This reminded of Venetia and Frederick, but both of them are magnificent compared to this. Though compared to recent wallpaper historical this is a wonderful read. ",
                    "This book had it all: spys, traitors, actors, poets, forgers, rakes, missing brothers and instalust. Lots of instalust. On the one hand I liked Jemima, though it did seem like she was taken advantage of. As far as Bryce goes, I really didn't know what to make of him. I can't like it because it is too steamy, but it had its moments.",

Save yourself from the drama, prissiness and cheesiness of it all.Why must good plots suffer from weak characters and bad dialogue? I'm not going to describe anything else about this book. Just trust me on this one.It's a DNF delight. Yet...I actually read this. Grr. ",
                    "This story was written by two authors whose work I always check out when there's new story, so the both of them together was a must read for me.Patrick and his two roommates and best friends Ronnie and Oliver are living hand to mouth and things are only getting worse.This story has a lot of the cliches you would expect in a May-December romance, set with a porn studio backdrop, Patrick,is a twink, young and relatively inexperienced sexually, he was kicked out by his father for being gay and he is trying to keep himself and his friends off the street. Vance Cullain is rich and successful in business, he has never lacked for men wanting to warm his bed, but as soon as he sees Patrick at the audition for one of his porn films, he knows this boy is to be his and he won't share him with anyone else, on or off screen.Despite getting both POVs Patrick's personality and insecurities came through more than Vance's do, we learn of Patrick's anxiety and his need for meds on occasion, but that wasn't really explored or mentioned again, I know he feels responsible for his friends and wants to go back to school and become an architect. All I really got from Vance was that his niece is a brat and has him totally under her thumb and he runs an adult film company. There is a bad guy who tries to drive a wedge between the lovebirds, and a in my opinion very annoying niece of Vance named Becca who has no real redeeming qualities, even if others might see her differently.The misunderstanding and its resolution was a little weak, but this story is more of a light, fluffy, insta-lust Cinderfella type story with a hot toppy older guy and his cute younger boyfriend.It made for a fast entertaining read.I think the friends will also get their story, and I look forward to reading about them.",
                    "If you're looking for a somewhat cute, not too deep, often cheesy story about a porn company owner instantly falling for one of his auditioners, then this one is for you.Patrick has just about hit rock bottom trying to keep he and his friends/roommates, Robbie and Oliver, afloat. Oliver had been in a bad car accident where he lost his boyfriend, is still dealing with the aftermath of his own injuries and has a mountain of healthcare bills to pay. Patrick and Robbie have been taking care of him but their money has run out. Patrick decides to try out for porn, but the owner, Vince, decides he is exactly his type and calls the audition off in order to keep Patrick for himself. Here is where it starts to get a little cheesy. They hit it off, and Vince offers Patrick a job as his PA. All is well until Vince's other PA makes trouble.Needless to say, this was aN easy read you don't have to get too involved in or think much about. The writing is smooth, and the story moves along quickly. I'm looking forward to reading about sweet Oliver's story next.",
                    "This story has a good potential to be great, but it doesn't live up its expectations. Things are quite fine until they MCs start dating. There's not much feelings in the story that it simply works mechanically. The bare bone is there, but that's it.It still is difficult for me to accept the reason he does porn is because his close friend is sick. I know they're supposed to be like brothers, but it's still a bit stretch to me.",
                    "The cover of this book is ghastly and does the story no justice. The story is actually quiet comforting and sweet. It isnt about two men who do porn, so it isnt a kind of 'Pretty Woman' story, rather it is about two men who find love in an unexpected place. A nice short read by two authors who are great at writing story series.",

She also doesn't hesitate to dust off every ridiculous romance novel cliche she can get her hands on.The worst part of this book for me, though, was how Ms. Haeger seems to go out of her way to deliberately introduce factual errors into her books that pull even a moderately knowledgeable reader right out of the story. I know, I know: it's horrifically unfair for me to expect that the writer would expend the immense energies required to type Catherine of Aragon into Google Image Search before describing her appearance in minute detail. Ridiculous that I expected her to double-check Mary Tudor's actual date of birth in one of those nasty encyclopedias. How awful I must I be to have noticed that the protagonist's mother is still alive well after her funeral takes place. And can you believe my sheer effrontery in wanting the year 1509 to occur only once?Feh.",

                    "The Secret Bride / 978-0-451-22313-5Here's an excerpt from the opening pages of Secret Bride. To set the stage, children Mary and Henry have just learned that their brother Arthur is dead. Relative adult (at age 18) Charles Brandon has made an inappropriate smirk as to the likelihood of the widow Katherine being pregnant: ---Oh come now, Charles remarked, seeing Mary's expression. We only hope to put a bit of a brave face on a horrid tragedy. And how difficult for you is that? she asked tautly, sounding much older than her years. Now your dearest friend will next be king. Arthur barely knew you, and what he knew he did not much like. But my brother Henry adores you. It seems to me great fortune for you in the tragedy of another. Mary! Henry charged. I understand you are upset - we all are. But you really must apologize for such words.  I will not, she stubbornly declared, tipping up her chin with a defiance like his own, which ran so thickly through her blood that she could not have tamed it. Charles is arrogant and selfish and I do not like him. Yet I do. And it is I whose command you shall be made to follow soon enough. You can command my compliance, Henry, but never my heart! ---I feel that this passage neatly sums up all the problems with this book and with Haeger's writing. As such:1. Haeger's characters all sound the same. Read that passage again. Can you tell that Mary is 8 years old? Can you tell that Charles Brandon is 18 years old? Can you see a difference between Mary a princess of the blood, and Brandon a disenfranchised orphan dependent upon the goodwill of the royal family? Is there a difference in speech between Henry the favored price and new heir, and Mary a marriage pawn and relatively powerless princess? Put another way, if Haeger removed all names and pronouns from the passage, could you tell who was speaking which part? I cannot. 2. Haeger's characters do not sound human. Arthur barely knew you, and what he knew he did not much like. It's important to talk like this when providing plot exposition to an invisible reader hovering over the room, but in an actual conversation it would not be necessary to reiterate a well-known fact among the conversation participants that Arthur and Charles were strangers and did not much care for each other. In Haeger's narrative, everyone speaks as if there's a 21st century observer looking over their shoulder. 3. Haeger's characters do not act within the narrative. Arthur, older brother of Mary and Henry, has just died. These young children have been reminded suddenly and sharply of their own mortality. Furthermore, Henry is now heir to the throne, with all the responsibilities, tutoring, and un-fun stuff that being an heir entails. Their world has forever been changed: divided between Before-Arthur's-Death and After-Arthur's-Death. Instead of reacting realistically to these sudden, jarring, terrifying changes, the children are posturing and silly, with Mary raising her chin in youthful defiance, sounding older than her eight years, and carefully hashing out the bounds of Henry's regal power over her heart and actions. There are no tears, no shocked silence, no rages against the heartless god that allowed a brother to die and a royal bloodline to be threatened, nothing that we would expect of actual humans. Why should there be? There's a narrative to get on with!4. Haeger's characters have read novel's dust jacket description. There's really no other explanation for this dialogue than that. Why does Mary defiantly insist that Henry can't control her heart? He hasn't suggested that he even wants to! He's told her to behave herself to Brandon regardless of her feelings in the matter, her rejoinder that her heart is still her own is irrelevant and begs a response of, Yeah, that's why I didn't order you to LIKE him. The only context in which this conversation makes sense is if it is read as a wink-and-a-nod to the reader - Remember the premise of this book? Mary is going to follow her own heart! The heart that Henry can't control! This removal from the narrative is distracting and simply awful writing. We see this repeatedly in Charles Brandon's suicidally rude treatment of Mary: an orphan dependent upon the good graces of King Henry does not openly mock his daughter, especially in a barely established court that is deeply paranoid about being seen as legitimate. However, Charles Brandon the Character realizes that he's in a romance novel and that the romance will be more interesting if Mary hates him in a sexual tension sort of way. I could go on and on, but the bottom line is that the book is just terrible. These literary sins occur on every page and the narrative is distractingly bad. In the end, I couldn't resell the book fast enough.~ Ana Mardoll",
                    "Okay so this had to be a DNF even before page 100. I started over with The Tudors on netflix and was so in the mood for a Tudor history book and decided to start this one and tbh I was BORED beyond compare, the writing wasn't cutting it, it was overly descriptive and focused more on that, the characters were flat and bland, and yet I LOVE LOVE LOOOOVE Henry VIII court for some reason! so lasting less than 100 pages for the first time ever, and despite not finishing a book, I decided to just call it quits and honestly proud of myself that I just did a DNF haha. I seriously have a hard time not DNF'ing and need to get in that habit and know that it's 100% okay to quit a book I'm not enjoying and I DEFINITELY wasn't enjoying this. And I'm so disappointed and it sucks. *crying internally* plus i can see why it didn't get many good reviews! ",
                    "Even imagining that Mary and Charles looked like Gabrielle Anwar and Henry Cavill from The Tudors doesn't make this book work. The writing's just plain bad. Their actual story is fascinating, it's one of those romances that really needs to be tackled by a good writer. Someone good also needs to tackle the story of Henry VIII and Mary's sister Margaret, who married into Scotland and got a divorce when her own brother couldn't, but I digress. ",
                    "Diane Haeger’s The Secret Bride is a novel about the romance between Mary Tudor, the younger sister of Henry VIII, and Charles Brandon, a handsome and ambitious young courtier who, since childhood, had been the young King’s companion and close friend - inasmuch as Henry actually was capable of friendship.The novel is full of rich detail about the social life of the Tudor court during the days when Henry was young, still deeply attached to his wife Katherine of Aragon, and ambitious to make England a major player on the European political stage. The young Mary, betrothed since childhood to the Prince of Castile, is exploring life as fully as she can while she waits to be taken off and finally married to a strange man in a foreign country. Brandon is the ambitious darling of the court. Married several times, into money and families of rank, he hopes to become a power in the country, rising above his commoner roots into the ranks of nobility. But slowly, even knowing that the odds are vast that they can never be together, Brandon and Mary nonetheless fall in love. Politics eventually pits and end to the betrothal with the prince of Castile, but Henry almost immediately arranges a marriage between Mary and the sick and aging King of France, Louis XII. Mary begs of Henry a promise - that if she marries Louis without complaint, when she is a widow, she will be allowed to remarry as she pleases. Henry agrees - but though she believes him, the reader knows full well he says it only to get her to go without causing a fuss he’ll have to deal with. In addition to portraying the love story between Mary and Brandon, the novel gives us a close look at how Henry himself changes from a generous young boy to a ruthless and selfish king. The disappointments of his marriage with Katherine, the long series of miscarriages and stillbirths, are seen as part of the process that sours Henry, along with the machinations of the powerful courtiers around him - Buckingham, Norfolk, Wolsey - making him suspicious, determined to have what he wants and capable of lying to himself and others to achieve it. But through the politics of the English and French courts, and Henry’s anger, Mary and Brandon’s love finally wins out, and though their life together lacks both the wealth and position she was raised to and he coveted for much of his life, the novel suggests, as does history, that they were happy.

                    "Funny characters and a hell of a lot of Texas twang could only take this book so far before it fizzled out.Rating: 3.5It's a romance cliche to end a novel with a wedding. Carolyn Brown dumps that cliche on its head and starts her book with Jasmine King and Ace Riley getting married in a Las Vegas chapel.They're doing it because Ace has just found out about a stipulation in his grandfather's will that says he needs to be married for a year or his ranch will go to a hated cousin. Jasmine, Ace's best friend, has had a disastrous break up and, since she's not planning on getting back in that saddle for at least a year, proposes to Ace thinking that no one in their small town has to know.Except that their wedding ends up making the national news. And the dreaded cousin starts making problems for them. And they have to live together at the ranch and make their marriage look convincing to the bunch of cowboys that live there, too.I'll admit, I'm a sucker for modern marriage-of-convenience stories. Married for a will or a business deal? Eh, depends on how it's done. I was able to suspend my disbelief long enough to get into this story - also long enough to really start caring for Jazzy and Ace as characters.But once they move in together, the conflict mellows out and there's still more than half the book left. They're married, they're living together, they're best friends who are attracted to each other, they're having sex...what's keeping them from actually being together?Not a whole lot. There are a few misunderstandings, some of which are inadequately explained. There's a hell of a lot of interaction with all their friends and family (too much for my taste - there are so many secondary characters that this small town felt overpopulated, and I felt like I was having new names tossed at me every few sentences).I wanted something much more dynamic after the quirkiness of the opening. But I was disappointed."

                    "My Review:A cowboy romance set in the wilds of Texas...one of my favorite things and this book did not disappoint. It was entertaining and fun and just the perfect read as a light, contemporary romance. It helped a lot that I know the part of Texas pretty well where the book was set. When we were dating, my husband (then boyfriend) lived in Altus, Okla and I lived in Lubbock, Tx. One of us drove through this section of Texas pretty much every weekend, so it was fun to go back and visit it through the reading of this book.This is my first Carolyn Brown book I've read, although it is number 4 in this series. As such, there were a LOT of characters in this book, and I will admit, I got completely lost trying to keep track of who was who. But I loved both Ace and Jasmine so much, it honestly didn't matter about all the others. I LOVED these two characters. They've been best friends for over a year and it shows through in their relationship/marriage. There isn't the normal conflict that you find in romance novels with all the doubts and stress...even though neither one is really very sure about the marriage when their feelings start to develop. They maintained an honesty between them that I really liked.The great thing about this book is that you get the best of small-town life in Texas. Ace has his ranch which is a working ranch with fully functioning bunkhouse, ranch hands, and even a few sexy brothers on hand over the summer to help out. Jasmine owns the local restaurant in town so you get glimpses of town life and the traffic through her little cafe. In the midst of all that there are the families and a holiday thrown in which rounds out the small-town feel of it all. If you like cozy, contemporary romances, this is a fun one.I liked the way the story was set up. The marriage was Jasmine's idea entirely after Ace finds out he has one week left on a two year deadline to get married (that he didn't know about) to get to keep his ranch he inherited from his grandfather. They plan to get married, turn the marriage license to the lawyer, and then quietly get divorced a year later without ever telling anyone else they got married. That plan is blown away when they are the 5000th couple to get married in this particular Las Vegas chapel and they make the national news. Surprise! Suddenly they find themselves in the middle of a real marriage. Like I said, what really made this work for me was the fact that they are good friends. When the dynamic between them starts to change, they talk about it, like they've always talked about everything. It's really well-done!There were a couple of little things that bothered me about the book: too many characters and I got lost, but that is easily remedied by reading the rest in this series (on my wish list as we speak.) There were also moments when the phrasing used was just so over-the-top hokey, but for the most part, I could just ignore that. ,o) It was a fun book to read and I will definitely be picking up some more Carolyn Brown books soon....",
                    "Reviewed By~DesereReview Copy Provided By~NetgalleyOne Hot Cowboy wedding is exactly what this book was! From the very, very and I do mean very hot Ace to the delicious Southern talk right down to the blazing passion between Ace and Jasmine, I adored every second of this book. It has the makings for a really good romantic chick flick. We have the delicious cowboy, the woman who saves him, the family and secrets that threaten to tear them apart and that big old wonderful feeling called true love in the most unexpected places with unexpected people. This book is just one of many in a series called Spikes and Spurs and Carolyn Brown has most definitely done just that, she spiked my interest with the title and spurred me to not stop reading till I got the end. The book was incredible, full of the usual passion and lust that we all expect from handsome cowboys but also that adorable Texas thing called I take care of my own but admitting to loving them I'll have to really think about it . I fell in love with Ace and Jasmine from page one, the way their friendship was full of fun and full of flirtation but without the added heat (that is until they got to the you may kiss the bride part), Ace has some of the funniest lines I have ever heard and Jasmine is a real tough cookie, she does not take slack from anyone not even mean Mr. I want the ranch Cole. The author incorporated various songs into the book which was first for me but so much fun, not only does she let the characters see the truth in the lyrics of the songs she also uses it to add spice to certain scenes which really did make for some very interesting and new fun reading. Some cowboy books have passion, action, love and drama but what the author has done is added a lot of fun new little sayings and scenarios that really had me laughing out loud. The real Texas language used is a real hoot to those that have like myself never really heard it before, I have fallen in love with Texas for sure! This author is a keeper, we need more Carolyn go forth and write!! ",
                    "Love, love, love!!!!!!! Loved it!It was fun!It was sexy!It was playful!But the ending... Disappointing. Honestly, I thought it was going to end differently. It was fun, fun, fun... oh. That's it?",
                    "This TWO-FER review posted on Guilty PleasuresAmanda's ThoughtsWelcome back to Ringgold, Texas! Where the men are true blue cowboys and the girls are smart and sassy and boy are there enough of them to go around. I’ve just finished reading One Hot Cowboy Wedding and I thoroughly enjoyed it. This is the latest release in Carolyn Brown’s Spikes and Spurs series and the story of Jasmine King and Ace Riley. Jasmine is the owner and cook of the Chicken Fry Diner and her best friend Ace Riley, a well-known player if there ever was one, and rancher. Ace needs to get married within a week’s time and stay married for a year, in order to fulfill his grandfather’s will or else it will be rescinded and given to his cousin Cole. Ever being the true blue friend Jasmine proposes that they do get married for him to keep the ranch and they do it as a marriage of convenience and as a secret. Once the papers are filed and the one year time’s up they would simply get a quickie divorce and all will be good. They fly to Vegas and get married at a wedding chapel but what happens in Vegas doesn’t always stay in Vegas. It turns out that Ace and Jasmine’s secret wedding is the 500th wedding for the chapel and it got spotlighted nationally on the evening news! So much for keeping this marriage a secret! Of course everyone back in Texas sees it and now they have to play the part of a married couple in order to keep the ranch all nice and legal for Ace. That’s when the trouble begins.I love the way Carolyn Brown writes with heavy on similes and contemporary western songs to draw you a picture in your mind for her characters. Sometimes I find myself going to my iPod and listening to the songs she mentions to put me in the same mood as the characters. She writes very likeable characters and ones you want to cheer for to get a little bit of happiness after they’ve been done wrong. Jasmine had no intention of getting romantically involved again after what her longtime ex-boyfriend two timed her. Ace himself had a barbed wire tattoo on his left bicep and let it be known he’ll never let a woman into his heart because it won’t get passed his tattoo. Jasmine and Ace may have done things a little backwards by getting married first and then start to date and fall in love, but it is their journey there that is fun to watch. They have some tender moments, hot sex and kisses that drive them both crazy. You see them both a little vulnerable and they grow a little too, which makes their getting together a little sweeter. What is an added bonus in her books is she brings other characters from her earlier books. You hear about what they are up to and they add their two cents to Jasmine and Ace’s love story. You can read One Hot Cowboy Wedding as a stand-alone because you get enough info about past relationships and the other characters from other books, so you shouldn’t feel lost as you read it. One Hot Cowboy Wedding is a definite recommendation to read for a light romance read. And if you haven’t read Carolyn Brown before you should check out her other series, both the Lucky series and the Honkytonk series, which are both fun series to read. Gennie's Thoughts:I really enjoy Carolyn Brown’s books and One Hot Cowboy Wedding is no exception. This is the fourth book in her Spikes and Spurs series and features playboy Ace Riley and business woman turned café owner Jasmine King. Jasmine and Ace become good friends over eighteen months mainly because Jasmine isn’t bowled over by Ace’s good looks and cowboy charm. One day Ace finds out that all he thought was his will be taken away if he doesn’t get married in a week. Jasmine being the good friend that she is volunteers and they go to Vegas to seal the deal because everybody know what happens in Vegas STAYS in Vegas, right?!?Well in this case no, it doesn’t because Ace and Jasmine happen to be a human interest story about the 5,000th marriage in a wedding chapel. As soon as the story airs back in small town Texas, Ace and Jasmine are forced face the music. The funny thing is that they have a wonderful friendship, but after their first kiss, the sparks fly and both are worried about losing their best friend in all this wedding mess.There are some twists and turns, but this story is mainly about figuring out who you are and how your family and friends can help you along or become a stumbling block. What I like most about Ms. Brown’s work is that she is an author from my neck of the woods and every time I read her books, I find another saying that I have heard most of my life, but never see in other books. For example, in this book it was “praise the Lord and pass the biscuits!” The supporting characters in this book and this whole series are great and I hope that we will see more of Lucy and her new beau in the next story!If you like hot cowboys, good old-fashioned wisdom, family, close friends and some good sex scenes, you will love this book and Carolyn Brown’s work!",
                    "What happen in Vegas, was supposed to stay in Vegas.Without saying a word to friends and family, Ace and Jasmine goes to Las Vegas to get married. Are they in love ? No, they're just friend, but when Jasmine learn that her pal have one week left to find a wife or he lose his ranch to a cousin (thanks to his grandpa's will), she propose to him. They only have to stay married one year and the plan is to divorce after that. But you can bet your ass that fate have a say in it. They're supposed to return to Texas right after the ceremonial and never tell a soul about their fake union, but they win a local contest which include honeymoon suit and limousine. So when their win/wedding makes the news, their phones can't stop ringing as family and friends can't believe what they heard.A kiss seal the deal and make them discover an attraction for their friend they never felt before. Ace is known in town as a player. Not as in a guy who lie and breaks heart, but as the kind of guy who have a little black book to record all the names of the women he dates. Jasmine was the girl he talk to about his women's trouble, going daily to the café she own. Jazzy have already been burned by love and a ladie's man is certainly the last man she would choose otherwise for a husband. But she's a fixer and always help people. Back in Ringgold, living together was not part of the plan for Ace and Jasmine, but once again destiny interfere and being in close quarter with their new spouse will not be the smooth ride they thought it would be. There's something so sweet, so soothing in Carolyn Brown's stories, but it never lack sparks and excitement. I always wondered if Texan really talk like that (I guess some do and some don't) but no matter the answer, I like reading her turns of phrases and the playful banter between the protagonists. The fun in reading romance with a womanizer is to see how hard the man fall in love and become perfect boyfriend who only see the heroine from now on. Ace may be a Casanova, but that doesn't mean he's not romantic or don't believe in love. I liked that Ace encouraged the heroine to be herself and speak her mind. It's sweet that when they talked about the other people living with them they called them the kids. I thought there was more sex scenes in this one than her other books, but like she usually do, they never last long anyway. It's just enough to tease us with it :p I was happy to see Wil and Pearl again. Them especially because their romance was the first Carolyn Brown's book I read and it was love at first read for me. My father's girlfriend kind of judge me because I only read stories with a happy ending and implied that I should broaden my horizon (don't waste your breath, you'll never make me change my mind about this). She doesn't understand that for my mental peace I need to read about good people and read about things we don't hear about anymore in real life. Yes, it's not always realistic and that's exactly why I read it and love it so much. And that's exactly why Carolyn Brown is one of my favorite author. She write about people who won't never lie or betray you, who doesn't know bad intention in the first place. She write about happily ever after, not the fairy tales kind, but the kind where you confront the trials together and it only makes your couple stronger and you laugh and have fun with your sweetheart in between those moments. It's about helping your neighbors when bad luck and hard knocks happen and give someone the shirt off your back. It's about loving your family (family is not just sibling but friends too), even when they get on your nerves and try to make decision for you. Sorry about the personal venting, I guess her comments pissed me off more than I thought. To finish things off on a high note, here's some quotes I especially liked.Most of the time he came into the café in his scuffed work boots, faded jeans, and shirts with the sleeves cut out, the barbed wire tat around his arm was a constant reminder that he never intended to let a woman anywhere near his heart. A motel bed or her bed,yes, but never his heart or his bedroom.-Those are two places I'm saving for the love of my life if I ever meet her.-That can be remedied anytime you want a taste of the real thing, so you don't have to pretend. That sounds like the beginnings of a good country song. Think I should call Josh Turner and see if he wants to write the rest of it? -Darling, I'm not just a romantic at heart. I'm a romantic all over my body, he said with a wicked gleam in his eyes."

                    "At first, I was hesitant in reading it since it was in Filipino(tagalog). Yes, I admit it. Even though I’m a Filipino, I hate reading tagalog/filipino stories since I feel like it can make me go crazy because of those difficult words to understand. But I was wrong. This novel type story was easy to read and to be understood. Once I started from the prologue then chapter one, that’s it! Chapter one captured my attention and kept me going on in reading the story.The story comprises of 50 chapters. And was written by Bianca Bernardo or better known as SGwannabe.In my opinion, the story is really really good! To be short, it’s about a girl who acted as a “fake girlfriend” to a boy so that the boy would get his ex-girlfriend back. And eventually, the girl and boy fell in love to each other. You may think that it’s a simple and the usual story but it’s not! It was full of tension with some really amusing twists in the story and every page makes me just keeps on reading every word and every sentence. And then whenever I stop because I need to sleep already, my mind just keeps like imagining and seems that it wants me to continue reading the story. Okay, might sound weird. But that’s how I feel whenever I stop reading it. The story brought the old high school self in me once again. The old self where all I want to do is talk to my classmates and have those kilig moments. Some lines from the story: “Can I like you from afar?” - Athena “Kahit na ipagtabuyan mo ko, kahit na mag sawa ka sakin, kahit na iwanan mo ko, ikaw at ikaw parin ang mamahalin ko” - Kenji  “Simula ngayon, dalawa tayong lalaban. Kung pagod ka na, ako ang lalaban para sayo. Wag kang matatakot. Hindi kita iiwan. Kahit anong mangyari, nasa tabi mo lang ako.” - Kenji “I’ll wait for you. Hihintayin kita hanggang sa magsawa ako kakahintay sayo. Hanggang sa mapagod ako. Hanggang sa mawalan ako ng lakas.. kakahintay sayo.”- AthenaBetter read the story yourself so that you can understand me! As an early warning, it would make you feel those butterflies in your stomach, make you laugh and cry all at the same time! Babbling Truths",

                    "Cliche. Mainstream. Korean. Bothering words: Pati Hinde Emoticons: ^__^Punctuations: ???? !!!!!! Too much CAPITALIZATIONMy friends liked it. I don't know but this isn't my thing.I stopped reading sometime in Chapter 15...I'm not sure. Basta more than 10 but less than 20. Na turn off ako, di ko kinaya. xDEh kasi naman masyadong predictable ang mga nangyayari. I don't know about the others but its like that for me. Gusto ko lang muna sabihin na kaya ko 'to nasasabi kasi the stories I've read, published and not published, are MUCH better than this one. Organize, descriptive and original.Kung nakapagbasa na kayo ng english na story sa wattpad with at least a hundred thousand reads, maiintindihan nyo 'ko.Yung mga tipo ng story na kahit di icapitalize at lagyan ng sandamakmak na exclamation and question marks ng author yung gusto nyang iemphasize, naeemphasize pa din sa utak ng readers kasi magaling yung pagkakadescribe. Yung hindi puro dialog lang. Cliche yung story ng SDTG nung umpisa. The characters are too mainstream. May mala F4 na barkada yung bidang lalaki, may bestfriend si girl tapos si bidang girl ay si typical teleserye girl pero medyo mas malala yung pagka OA nya dito. Yung tipo ng istoryang mapapa Ay napanood/ alam ko na 'to eh.Nakakadisappoint din para sakin yung mga stories na ang may gawa eh Pilipino pero yung characters nya may mga halfbreeds. (Tulad nitong SDTG) Tapos masyado pang ieemphasize sa story.(Mga dialog na korean, expressions etc) Don't get me wrong though.  I have nothing against Koreans.  It's just that colonialism is a turn off for me. May sarili naman tayong kultura ah...isipin nyo, yung mga koreans ba ganito din ka-fond sa mga pinoy? Na gagawa ng stories then ang mga bida half pinoy? Tapos marunong magtagalog.. lol. kung meron man, di ko maimagine. Problema kasi saten, masyado nating minamahal ang culture ng iba. Okay. Tama na. Hypocrite na 'ko. Kasi fond din naman ako sa British and some American ways. Yun nga lang di naman sobra.Going back. Basta eto.Kung hindi exprienced sa pagbabasa ng published books yung makakabasa nito, malaki talaga yung chance na magustuhan nila 'to at sabihing this is the best story ever. omg! but for those who have read the wattpad stories of XxSkater2Girl16xX, modernongmariaclara, and witcheverwriter o yung nakabasa na ng mga best selling books, international man yan o local, tulad ko, di masyadong maaapreciate 'to.I've read the ending, though. (Yeah I skipped from Chap 15 to the end) This year ko lang binasa yung ending. Kasi kapag tinatanong ako ng friends ko kung nabasa ko daw ba yung SDTG, sinasabi ko di ko tinapos tapos pinipilit nila akong basahin yung ending kasi nakakaiyak daw. So yeah binasa ko. Ang masasabi ko lang...Okay given, sweet, kasi nga sinunod ni Kenji yung gusto ni Athena, this story proved that love can make you do stupid things, magiging selfless ka. Naalala ko nga dito yung kantang too much love can kill you PERO kahit ganun, ang selfish pa din ni Athena. (Buti sinabi sa story na alam nyang selfish sya) Since may twist naman pala sa huli, I give it a two. :)",

                    "(some re-editing has been done)I was a bit hesitant to read this book, but a good friend of mine recommended this, so I gave it a shot. After reading for almost four hours straight (five actually- if you count the hour I fell asleep in the midst of reading), I closed the book and placed it in my bag- eager to return it to my friend the next day.First of all, he's not even what you call a gangster. She dated a delinquent/troublemaker highschool boy who's only famous for his good looks-- if I'm not mistaken.The story depicts a typical highschool love story with predictable plot, one-dimensional characters and cliched sugar coated dialogs. With pages less than 150, it was quite difficult for me to pinpoint any distinction of this from any other teen lit romance books that I've read (some regrettably). As far as I can tell, this is just one of those stories you can read on a Precious Heart Romance best-selling pocketbook series, but in English language.PLOT:It has a resemblance and a mixture of two Korean films titled 100 days with Mr. Arrogant and He was Cool.The story was bland, unoriginal and basically just watching a movie in a fast-forward mode. Everything moves fast with little emotions. Perhaps the writing was entitled or in a hurry to meet only a limit of 150 pages. There were times when I scratched my head literally not in confusion, but in disappointment.First off, the prologue threw me off. It almost sounded like Twilight but instead of a vampire, it's a gangster. I ONCE FELL IN LOVE with a gangster. Everything between us happened so fast, and our relationship took me completely by surprise.If ever I happened to read that kind of prologue, I would return it in the shelf without hesitation or second glance. I mean seriously, let's think more of a unique introduction. Haven't we always came across those kind of lines in other romance teen books, in movies, dramas or even in songs?Most importantly, the book clearly isn't familiar with Show, don't Tell. This is very vital and crucial technique especially in terms of writing fiction that obviously the book has failed to provide us. But then again, what can we expect from such a few-paged book?If you wanna know more about Show Don't tell..Probably my hatest parts:page 127The part where Kenji and Abigail were talking. And Kenji was all like ...Yeah sure you can die anytime. And Abigail says Forget it Kenji... You won't see me again. Ever.Kenji walked away cursing, leaving her. That was probably an awful way to end a relationship with someone especially your ex who is dying. I know Abigail is the least favorite here, but Kenji's still arrogant personality threw me off a bit here. I thought he changed. Still he's an undeveloped character.and page 50After they went to Kenji's house with soaked clothes from the rain...From Athena's POV:I rushed to his side. Kenji was all wrapped in a blanket and shaking violently.I was quite shocked here. How do you shake violently? Is it with eyes going white? Anyways, when I read the part violently I already imagined him in a convulsion state. How do you show violently at that part? And to think it was just a high fever... but that was fast. Usually it would take about half a day for a person to have a fever after getting soaked in wet clothes and cold rain. You don't happened to have a fever in a snap of a finger.*sighs*CHARACTERS:The characters were not interesting. You have this bad boy falls in love with the new girl in school and blah, blah, blah. You get the picture. It's mostly a copy-pasted characters from Kdramas such as Boys over Flowers and some American chick flicks.Athena Dizon- A flat character. Aside from not really letting us know her perspective in life, it lacked realism specifically when it comes to her emotions. Most are just rants. Sure, there were phrases such as I cried... I blinked back my tears, but emotions aren't only based on actions. They are also revealed internally- on her thoughts, opinions, realizations and feelings. That's why there was no connection between Athena and I, because her thoughts were limited. It was hard reading her which shouldn't be (if she's Bella Swan, that is lol) because First person are the most intimate with readers since both parties know what the character is feeling throughout the story. Also, Athena (which should be, again) is not very observant to the things around her and how her life goes. Also, she has illness, but how could I feel sympathy at her when the author doesn't clearly know how to feel what it's like to be dying. I mean, I'm not saying I have a cancer and I'm dying or that you should really experience something to write about it, no... but chest pain has already beaten to death already in the book. I was like all, Okay, she's sick. Whatever. The descriptions were basic and insufficient. Can't the book SHOW more of how it's like to be dying? I'd probably switch reading to A walk to remember.Kenjie de los Reyes- A Gary Sue character. Perfect in a way he's popular, handsome, good athlete --- Goo Jun Pyo, is that you? He has flaws okay, but not something important, not important in bringing up the story. He doesn't have weakness as well (at page 30, where in he got in a brawl with a guy and afterwards, he had no any scratch or bruise at all... how is that even impossible?). It still bothers me why he didn't explain throughout the story the reason why he and Abigail broke up in the first place. And the reason why he took a job as a waiter. O_o His dialog came off as unnatural because it wasn't casual as it could be (when he's shown as a bad boy), kind of childish to say the least. His POV and his tone/voice were similar to Athena's except that the pronouns changed, and it's manlier. I don't know but it seems that his type of character are overused by other writers as well on Wattpad. Why people love bad boys, huh? As for the other characters...I couldn't care less about them, especially when it comes to Lucas and Abigail-- the stereotypes. Lucas portrays the good guy- gentleman and loyal who was in a relationship with Abigail-- the mean ex girlfriend of Kenji (who's still quite possessive of him). They were undeveloped and were just cut-out cutboards with small roles with no depth. They didn't help develop the story at all. I'm especially disappointed with Sara, Athena's bestfriend, she doesn't act like one. For example, you don't tell your friend to be in a fake relationship with someone just to get a revenge, because you're probably sure she will get hurt at the end. But as for her, she supported the idea. Voila!...The ending was quite unexpected, sounds like Romeo and Juliet. The same scenario just as on their production play where the two major cast was played... but of course, by them. The ending was probably targeted to audiences who are fond of tragic love ending. But, I didn't buy it.*sighs*I gave this book two stars since (the good side is) this would help indeed expand more contemporary Filipino fiction. It would also help encourage younger generation to appreciate our local writers. ^^ But then again, quality-wise of this book, needs more improvement and proof-reading. ^^I don't want to be rude since this is actually my first review in this site. So if ever I am (which I think I am), pardon me. Everything's solely based on my views and opinions.If you like the book or not... and If you agree or not on this review, it just all depends on you. The reader. :)When all's been said and done, this book is a Wattpad sensation and it should remain just as it is.P.S To that friend of mine, I'm sorry. It's just not my cup of tea. &lt,3P.P.S I posted first my SDTG review under the name Munchy Sushi but had to close the account. You can actually see it under Newest, but guys, don't bother looking at it. So I created this new account (Sea Sprinkle), it's still the same review but had to edit some bits here and there for more clarification. :)",
                    "Bland. Unoriginal. Mainstream. Not Creative Enough. Bad Dialogue.most of my friends liked it but it just made me sad. really sad. it made me realize that our generation is developing bad taste in literature. we eat up basically anything that is unrealistic and badly-written so as long as there is a hot guy and a girl playing cat and mouse. typical koreanovela-ish.sounds like 100 days with mr. arrogant, don't you think?the prologue was unoriginal. sounded like I kissed a zombie and i liked it and Twilight.but even the ending? plagiarized from romeo and juliet. ugh. nooooothe guy was not even a gangster for godsake -.-and don't mention the emoticons or i might.....asdfghkl",
                    "What a freaking waste of money. Pardon my harsh words but I'm cutting back on book expenses and I'm a little picky with the books I buy these days. One hundred seventy-five pesos for a novella is a bit pricey but I support Filipino writers so that's okay. It's just that I want a good book to read not something I'll regret buying. I'm okay with trying new authors but this time, I should have bought another Summit book.The synopsis of She's Dating the Gangster is catchy. A refined bad boy had always been my weakness so I put it up in my wish list. I've also been hearing a lot of praise for this book given that it has a bunch of followers when it was still being published as fan fiction on the internet. I said it won't hurt if I give it a try. However, it did hurt in the end not because I got touched with the way it ended but because it was not worth it.I know I'm having such a violent reaction over this. It's just that I put so much hope in this book and since Summit Book published it, I was expecting it's pretty good. The writing isn't bad. Bianca has the potential of being a well-rounded author. I just don't like the way how the story went. There are things that bothered me and the ending was a deal breaker. I've read Summit Books before, they always end in a positive way. That's what Chick Lit is all about, right? I'm not looking for a happily ever after, but at least something that would empower women (as what Chick Lit had always been) not make you depress or fuming mad at the end.The character's age and the setting do not fit the storyline. There are things that are impossible to happen at that age. It would have worked if the setting is in college, it is more realistic than high school. Since I know this is originally a fan fiction, I'd let go of the similarities of most scenes from Korean dramas I've seen but that isn't enough reason for me not to look for something different and new with this book. Thinking about it, I don't know if I've read something I haven't read before. Probably one of the reasons why it didn't work is because I've read numerous New Adult novels I got immune with overly dramatic situations. I'm not gonna make any more excuses, the story didn't reach my heart. I was more annoyed than sad.I said I'm okay with bad boys but being an asshole is another thing. Kenji went from irritating to amusing, then charming and loving, and ended up as stupid, insensitive jerk. He was turning out as a lovable character with seventy percent of the novel, I don't get why he has to make a 360 degrees turn in the last couple of chapters. Athena was fierce at the beginning. I love her spunk but she turned out differently as the story goes. That's what I don't get in this novel. Why do the characters have to go from good, to bad, then worse?The only thing I find good in this novel is that it made me realize I need to review my Korean notes from a class I took last year. I'm now having a hard time reading Korean characters when it was so easy before. There are also some words I know differently from what was used in the novel. Maybe because they're using banmal or I only learned the basic formal/informal words and phrases.I honestly wouldn't recommend this book to teens or those with a weak heart and in the verge of suicide. You might get ideas. No matter how great that love is, I would still go with what Ramon Bautista said, There is more to life than love.ChallengeBook # something of 2013****Review also posted @ Off the Wall.",
                    "She's Dating The Gangster is the first Filipino novel I've ever read way back 2010 or 2011. I honestly think that Filipino novels are corny. Really. No offense. But then again, for some reasons, we don't have internet connection, and I am bored as hell. I decided to read the doc copy we had in our desktop. I find it really corny, I just have no choice. -.-I don't feel butterflies on my stomach, I don't cry, I just don't feel anything. Am I weird? Sorry for saying this but, I don't really like the ending. Killing yourself? Not my thing. I just don't get it. Well, I do. Still. Whatever. -.- Oh by the way, I like the Filipino version better. Why? It is more complicated, there are more foundation for Athena and Kenjie's love. But the author is right, if she would keep it's original length, it will cost higher. However, I never thought that reading SDTG will be my 1st step in reading more and more Filipino novels. Still now, I find Filipino novels, quite corny, cliche, whatever, but still, the hopeless romantic side of me, keeps wanting for more. So yeah, somehow, I am thankful for reading this. "

                    "The first two books is this trilogy were a bit meh, but this one?!Ha! Kidding!This one ended up being meh, as well.In fact, at times it teetered on awful.  Here's the thing: I was less than impressed with the 1st book, but decided to check out the 2nd book because I thought it was supposed to be about Rionna. &lt,--badass warrior chick!It was not about Rionna. The author did a switcheroo, and the hero fell in love with Rionna's BFF instead. Anyway. Finally, now we get to Rionna.The ass-kicker who beat one of the laird's best soldiers in the first book! Whooo! So, yeah, I was expecting a bit of this: But that's not what I got. Rionna turned out to be a little girl playing dress-up. She was easily cowed, easily beaten in combat, and easily led around by her husband. Plus, her new hubby was a douchebag because of the cliche PAINFUL EMOTIONS FROM THE PAST! Yeah, yeah, yeah. You've been hurt, I've been hurt, everyone who has ever lived EVER has been hurt.Fuck that noise, it's annoying. Plus, and this really made me cringe, he kept screwing her while she was asleep.What the what?! Is that something that guys do now? Am I just old and out of touch? Is that really acceptable dick etiquette in this day and age?Perhaps I'm just an unadventurous piece of white bread for thinking that being conscious was one of those things that made sex...sexy? Regardless, that better not be what wakes me up in the morning, motherfucker.I mean, Jesus Christ! Let me pee &amp, get a cup of coffee first! Anyway. The writing itself isn't bad, but the storyline just wasn't my cuppa.If anyone has any suggestions for a good men-in-kilts trashy romance novel, I'd love to hear it!"

                    "5...HUGE...Stars!!!I LOVED EVERYTHING ABOUT THIS BOOK! EVERYTHING!  Not only is it my favorite of the series, it has also landed on my all-time favorite bookshelf. And that's saying something, since that rarely happens. I felt so many emotions while reading this book and not one of those emotion was manipulated through cliched or manufactured plot devices. They were simply achieved through outstanding storytelling and writing. This is the story about an honorable but bitter and cold man plagued with guilt, remorse, and self-loathing due to the vulnerability and naïveté of his youth that almost destroyed his family and clan. It's about an awe-inspiring women who is a force to be reckoned with and whose character embodied the courage, compassion, strength, loyalty, and determination to not only help guide her clan but to restore a broken man. For me, Never Love a Highlander was an epic love story. It touched my heart, brought tears to my eyes, and made me a believer in true-love and all that it encompasses. It's a book with multifaceted characters that have embedded themselves in my heart and soul. I will treasure this story forever. ",
                    "Nope. Nope, nope nope nope.This is is just not my thing. I knew by page 39 when her brand-new husband kisses her harshly and against her will at a public dinner to shut her up (because women shouldn't have opinions or express themselves, apparently) and then she bites his lip and then he uses his tongue to smear the blood all in her mouth.Yeah. That happened.And she's a tomboy-warrior type woman and he wants her to wear dresses and cook all day, or something.In the middle of the book, she seems to get the hang of PRETENDING to be submissive in the bedroom and turning (sexual) submission into a sex game - which I was very on board with. Finally, I said to myself. She will just cutely play like she's a sex-slave in the bedroom, and he will be satisfied with that and they both will be happy. I find sexual games to be cute and adorable - only when both parties know it's a game, though. Nope! Nope, nope, nope! He doesn't seem to have gotten the memo that she's only playing. He still just cannot accept who she is as a person and fun, fake, sexual submission is not enough. She must be submissive to him in real life! Her only duty is running the keep (read: chores) and bearing him children!Blergh.Also he has a horrible habit of fucking her while she's sleeping so she always wakes up surprised to find a penis inside her. Every day, he does this EVERY DAY. I know women who have gotten divorced because of this shit.AND this is yet another book, about the billionth book that is a romance - written by a woman - which is trying to convince me that blowjobs are the MOST ENJOYABLE AND FEMININE thing EVER, and that giving a blowjob to a man is THE most, THE best thing you will ever do in your life, and the height of your feminine power and the biggest turn-on (for you, the female) ever in the history of ever. o.O Who the fuck are you trying to kid? Now. I'm not saying, Never give blowjobs or anything - far from it. But it always highly amuses me when a heterosexual female is trying to convince me that being on my knees and servicing a man orally is THE HEIGHT OF SEXINESS AND FULFILLMENT, OMG. Really? When did you get brainwashed? This really makes me laugh. You're honestly trying to convince me that giving a blowjob is more enjoyable than (names 50 other sexual activities)? LOL You're too funny. I don't mind blowjobs in romance books, but I DO mind when they start spouting this shit about blowjobs being the pinnacle of women's pleasure. o.O That's just stupid.Again, I think Banks has been consuming too much porn rhetoric. Her sex scenes (in this whole trilogy) are ripped from porn films. I guess it makes sense because she also writes erotica. What I THINK is happening is that she's so used to writing erotica it's bleeding into her romance and she's unable to turn off her rougher erotica aesthetic in order to create more enjoyable, gentler romance novels. *shrug* She DOES do better - again, I really enjoyed Highlander Most Wanted and Never Seduce a Scot. Give those books a chance - and skip this trilogy.ONE REAL STAR, ONE ROMANCE STAR",
                    "This was my favorite of the series because of the heroine. Rionna is a kick-ass girl who wears pants instead of a dress and trains with the warriors with a sword. She marries Caelen - who is kind of a jerk at first - in order to align their clans. He wants to turn her into a proper lady. She isn't real agreeable to this idea. I'm on her side.Their marriage has a few rocky moments as they each try to get the other to bend to their will. And, really, isn't that what marriage is all about? Trying to get your way? No? Hmm, I guess I've been doing it wrong, but don't tell my husband. I finally have him trained. Only took 23 years. I swear, I trained my dog faster. Dogs are great, aren't they? But, I digress...I liked this couple as they grew into each other, but the very best part of this story was when our warrior princess was doing what she does best - killing their enemies.",

                    "This was by far my absolute favorite of the series. I loved watching the love between Rionna and Caelan grow and bloom, it was magic. I've said it before, but the romance in this series is old fashioned and I loved every minute of it! ",
                    "Sigh. I devoured this series. It was the best kind of romance candy. The kind with hot highlanders, steamy sex, fierce battle scenes, feisty women, impossible odds, high stakes, and teary moments. While each book had a different hero/heroine, the trilogy had an underlying story as the McCabes prepared for war against their fierce enemy Duncan Cameron. I loved how the brothers were always main characters in each story, and how the heroines became important to the clans survival. While you could read the books out of order, I recommend that you don't. In the first book In Bed with a Highlander, the romance was of enemies-to-lovers, and in the second book,Seduction of a Highland Lass, it burned hot and fast. In Never Love a Highlander, the romance was slow and snuck-up on them as it built over time. Two strangers find themselves wed in a marriage of necessity, not of love, to unites two clans and build an alliance strong enough to defeat a looming war. Love was never important to either of them, their marriage was simply just an arrangement of necessity. Betrayed by the woman he loved eight years earlier, Caelen did not trust himself to love again. He was the hardest and coldest of the three brothers, devoted only to duty and family. Rionna McDonald is the daughter of a neighboring laird, and has been betrothed (or nearly betrothed) to all three of the McCabe brothers. If Caelen doesn't marry her, the humiliation would be too much. She is not a typical well mannered and dainty lass, but one who enjoys wearing trews and wielding a sword. Caelen doesn't know what to make of her ways, and tries to get her to be more feminine in both behavior and appearance. And now that Caelen is Laird of McDonald's clan, he has much to prove to gain the trust and loyalty of his people. The war with Duncan Cameron gets closer, and the brothers come together for the ultimate and final battle scene. I couldn't guess how the final battle was going to unfold, but I enjoyed it immensely. A fitting ending! I'm sad the trilogy is over, but I look forward to more books by this author. I do hope she writes more highlander historicals some day. ",
                    "Audiobook: Narrator - Kristen PotterI absolutely HATE that this series is over an not only because I’ll miss these characters, but because I’ll miss this narrator’s superb performance. She doesn’t just read the story and change her voice a bit here and there, she pulls you into it with her incredible diversity of voices and characters. None are the same, all are addicting, and each one I fell in love with due to Ms. Potter’s narration.This is the only book in the series that I never had the chance to read so I was thrilled to see it pop up on Audible. I wasn’t sure how I would feel about Rionna. Up to this point she’s kind of just been on the sidelines, a woman dressed in men’s clothing and a bit one dimensional. I was afraid she would be so tough and warrior like that I wouldn’t be able to connect with her. I couldn’t have been more wrong. She actually had so many layers to her. She had her reasons for her behavior and they were believable. She also wasn’t changing anytime soon but learned to embrace both her need to defend herself as well as the woman her husband called forth from her. Caelen once gave his heart away and his clan paid the deepest price for it. He has been a cold, hard character throughout the series, with a few exceptions when it came to his sisters-in-law. That was what I held on to. And also the fact that this author knows how to do alpha heroes. It was fun to watch both of the hero and heroine adapt to the changes in their life. So much of it was witty, some was angsty, and some was anger inducing. All of it kept me enthralled with the story. This has some drama that helps this couple to further develop individually and as a couple as well as a moment when Caelen’s worst nightmare comes to life. My heart broke for this couple and I wasn’t sure how they would overcome it if they survived.Each of the books in this series has been unique and individual with the exception that the heroes are fiercely loyal to the women they marry/love and the heroines are strong enough to deal with their forceful ways.Can’t recommend this series enough, but I do suggest you start from the beginning.Listened via Romance Pkg. although I own the book and ebookDual POVSafe  no ow/om dramaTriggers violence against women, violence",
                    "This is a wonderful end of this series. A sweet story between Caelan and Rionna. Both agree to be married for the sake of duty. More like married of convinience. Slowly they both grows fond of each other and later on develop romantic feeling. Miss Banks puts a twist of betrayal and bit of drama into the story. The focus of this book is more on the sex actually. It is a sweet cheesy over the top romance story. Minimum drama/ angst with a bit of suspense and betrayal. 4 stars"

Would have liked more in the treasure hunting, but still I was enjoying the story.Until just after the halfway point. Then we get the details on the bad guy. Ugh. Nothing ruins a story quicker than a bad guy who's so very bad that he's just plain stupid. It was as if every cliche and foolish bad guy trope was thrown in. And of course all his people around him are bad and they support the bad guy. Ugh. I couldn't wait for it to be done.Really disappointing because it didn't have to be this bad.",

I did feel for Daniela and what she went through, but the bad guys were just over the top crude and disgusting - and not in a good 'pull you into a suspense story' kind of way. Disappointing read that didn't appeal to me at all. Not sure if I'll pick up the next book in the series."

                    "Story Rating 4 StarsCharacter Rating 5 StarsRomance Rating 5 StarsAction Level 4 StarsHeat Level 3.5 tarsOverall Rating 4.5 StarsThis book could have easily been 5 stars across the board for me except it took me a short bit to get grabbed into the book. Once the story started going it grabbed me big time.I loved reading how Logan, Daniela and Logan's team went about looking and finding the treasure. These types of story's always fascinate me.The action in this book was as good as it gets making the story very exciting.I was very happy that Cherry kept the bedroom door open once these two finally got their hands on each other. Logan was so patient and caring with Daniela and it was very romantic and nothing over the top for the readers who like their romances sweet.The bad guy was a real creep and did terrible things to the heroine. I was so happy when he got his comeuppance in the end.OK so another big reason I took a 1/2 star off of the book was because we know Logan and his crew did find the treasure but once the big action started, the treasure was not mentioned again. I would have loved it if Cherry would have add just one more chapter before the ending that included Logan and his team retrieving the rest of the treasure and of Logan winning the bet made with his brothers because he found the biggest treasure.That being said the very ending was FANTASTIC and we got a short but sweet visit with Zane, Teal, Nick, Bria and of course Jonah. Speaking of Jonah, I was happy to see that Cherry has another book in this series coming out Spring of 2013 called Stormchaser and of course it will be Jonas's story. You can bet that I'll be reading it when I can get my greedy hands on it.",
                    "The violence in this book bothered me and I really didn't want a description of the villain's sick sexual exploits, beyond that I found the book okay.This is Logan's book, the eldest Cutter brother, he's responsible and loves running the business and hates liars and his BS meter starts running the moment he rescues the heroine from the sea and she fakes amnesia.The heroine is in a world of trouble, she ran from her ex to her criminal cousins who threw her over-board so that she could lead the hero to a ship they wanted him to salvage. She lies at the start and feels terrible about it and then she confesses part of the truth, about her cousins and the treasure.I have seldom read about a more creepier villain than the heroine's ex and his position of power made him even more creepier. All in all not Cherry's best, it had great sexual tension but parts of it grossed me out, I just haven't been feeling that much of romantic suspense lately and the graphic things bothered me plus I was also bored in the middle.",
                    "Sad that this is coming to an end. I liked that despite Logan's rabid thing about lies Dani's past wasn't made into a stupid melodrama.You lied to me.But I love you I can never love you back*You know what I want? I want Jonah to get a book and hook up with the Sea Witch.*totally not in the book",
                    "Good book that takes place on the seas. It's a steamy adventure to keep you entertained. Logan and Daniela are great together. It's not my favorite of the series, but I'm glad that I read it since it fits perfectly with the others. ",
                    "Rated 4.5 On the Run StarsWell, like the first two books in this series, this one didn't disappoint either. Except for one thing. The last two books won't be released until later this year. Soo boohoo, I've gotta wait to read them, but then again, lookin on the bright side, I have them to look forward to. Soo, let's turn that into a positive....Yay!This story is about yet another Cutter brother, Logan....his crew, his million dollar boat, and the mysterious but lovely woman, Annie, they found half drowned out at sea. Logan sure didn't know what he was getting into when he rescued her! She keeps him on his toes by trying to figure out what her story is.By the time Logan does figure Annie out, he's completely enamored with her and ready to help her out in any way he can. That may include bodyguards, special ops men, a small war, explosives, a corrupt senator (what's different about that huh), a kidnapping, attempted murder, drugs, murder, and lots of steamy hanky panky in between. Oh, and there's a wedding of a couple we know &amp, love (if you've been following the series)0.. Before I forget, Annie isn't really Annie after all! Sound slightly crazy, yeah it is, just a bit. Plus, there still is a story of how several ships sunk and the beautiful treasure to be salvaged from one of them.I can't wait for more later this year! One's about their mysterious newfound brother, Jonah, that they didn't realize they had."

                    "Four words: Beauty and the Beast. If it’s a Beauty and the Beast retelling, I’ll usually try to buy it no matter who the author happens to be. In this case, the book was also very cheap, which meant that I didn’t even mull it over, I just went straight to the check out.There are a number of plot points that lend themselves to the Beauty and the Beast tale: “The Brooding Boss” has sent himself into exile living away from prying eyes and wagging tongues, “Beauty” is sent to live with him due to a problem within the family. The two get off to a rocky start but slowly come to understand and accept each other, becoming closer in the process. A certain event happens that drives a wedge between the two and that they have to come to terms with / overcome in order to get their happy ending.The story is on the very short side – only a couple of hundred pages of large print (the large print edition was cheaper than the smaller print edition) and as such did not really allow for as much development as I would have liked to have seen. It felt like everything just remained at the surface and wasn’t explored to its full potential.I get the feeling that this story was just meant to be a quick read that leaves the reader with that content, fluffy feeling that the characters were able to put the past behind them and overcome the obstacles in their way, but personally I found myself wanting a lot more from the book than it was actually offering. When I turned the last page I felt like I’d only actually read half of the story that this could have been. It’s a shame because I felt that the author’s style really lent itself to this type of modern day retelling very well. Thought not particularly unique, she has a grounded narrative voice that I enjoyed. I just wish that the actual development hadn’t been side-lined so much.",
                    "Author Barbara Wallace borrows lightly from a treasured fairy tale and creates a delightful romantic tale in Beauty and the Brooding Boss. When lovely young Kelsey Albertelli signs on as the temporary assistant for reclusive writer Alex Markoff, she finds much more than the job description entailed. Eager to earn extra money to pay off a debt, Kelsey accepts the higher-than-average paying job without realizing she'll end up dealing with a gruff and gorgeous grinch who will captivate her mind and steal her heart. Alex doesn't want help in finishing his book. Even with a broken arm, he prefers his privacy--all the better to guard his wounded heart. However, his publisher is threatening court action if the book is not ready on time, so Alex grudgingly accepts Kelsey's persistent presence. Both Alex and Kelsey have emotional scars, and they each have to confront their fears of being hurt and learn to trust once again. Will these two likeable loners form a loving bond which will bring them their own fairy tale happy ending? Beauty and the Brooding Boss is Book One in Harlequin's Once Upon a Kiss mini-series. A sweet romance read which will make you smile--and that makes it all worthwhile.",

Most of the time I find the males h*rny idiots and the females to be suberbly annoying bimbos. Anyway, this novel is cheesy, corny, and cliche, but it works. It's tolerable. In fact, I don't mind at all. It's a harlequin romance. You're supposed to expect romantic cheesy-ness. As for the characters, they are all fairly likable...the male love can be a tad annoying at times, but he's supposed to be! He's the sexy beast!

De wereld is echt enorm interessant en goed en gedetailleerd uitgewerkt: ik vond het zo tot om te lezen over de G.E.P.’s en de Onzuiveren en ik heb echt vol gretigheid alle informatie opgezogen. De schrijfstijl leest als een trein, de personages worden gaandeweg beter en het verhaal is boeiend, spannend en verre van voorspelbaar. Het heeft zijn imperfecties, maar ik heb er absoluut van genoten! Nu maar hopen dat deel 2 en 3 ook vertaald worden... Uitgebreide recensie: http://thebookreview.nl/recensies/dys...",
                    "Unfortunately, I can't continue with this. The telling of her secret to someone she met the day before, a secret that they had to move town because, and one that could get herself and her father executed, was just too much for me. What other annoyances would lie ahead. Too many good books out there waiting to be read",
                    "This book was such a let-down in my eyes. I thought the premise sounded really interesting but it just wasn't well executed enough for me. The characters all felt quite two dimensional, nobody stood out to me at all - at least not in a good way - and I thought the love triangle or in this case.. square, was horribly done and just felt very cheesy and cliche. I know it's only 'teenage romance' but there are so many YA novels out there who got the romance part right as well. Especially the boys in this book didn't do anything for me, Daniel was okay, I guess, but Sebastian felt really lacklustre and boring as a character. So did most of the plot, sadly, despite the interesting premise and idea, I thought it was just way too predictable (minus perhaps one or 2 turns towards the end) but especially at the one third mark things seemed to slow down quite a bit (might have been when the romance got touched upon a bit more) and it got harder and harder to get through the pages. It definitely wasn't a page turner for me, there wasn't a single point where I thought, oh wow now it's getting really good. Last but not least I thought the writing wasn't that great either. The prose was by no means terrible, though I did occasionally roll my eyes at a choice of words here and there.Only reason I'm not giving this book one star is because I am sure that there are WAY worse books out there and I didn't actually hate it. Perhaps I just dislike it so much because it feels like a bit of a waste of a good concept. As I said above, in my opinion the author could have done so much more with the idea of this world and the concept of the Blemished, the GEM and etc. But instead she ruined it with bad characterisation (or the lack, thereof.) Also, seriously, that love square.",
                    "More like a 3,5 stars The story is interesting, but I didn't feel as much connected to the characters as I hoped, so therefore it doesn't quite deserve a 4 star from me. Nonetheless I'm curious to see where the story will be going from here and I have heard that part 2 and 3 will be getting translated by the publisher. So I will wait for them to come out :)"

                    "Wow.How can I put my feelings about this book into words..? I don't think I can. This book is amazing. And it's terrifying.This is an extremely well written Young Adult dystopia which could actually happen. And that's why it's terrifying. Look around you at the world, at the way women are treated even in this day and age, at the way beauty comes before all else (no matter how you kid yourself) and then this story becomes real.The characters in this book are amazingly well written. Mina is so real, so believable. Even the secondary characters are real. There are flaws and strengths and confusion and loyalty and love and hate shared between all of the characters.The plot twists and turns and jumps and keeps you hooked. I could not put this down, I turned page after page as quickly as I could. It's shocking and brutal but at the same time shows love and compassion. This is amazing writing.Feminism is presented subtly in this book. And it's done right. It isn't about rights for women, it's about rights for everyone, which is as it should be.In this world there are the Blemished and there are the GEMs. The GEMs are superior in every way - they are genetically modified perfection who live a privileged life centered around their beauty and intellect. Then there are the Blemished, those who aren't genetically perfect. This is where the feminist issues are strongest - it may be easier to control the fertility of men, but oh no. The women go for the operation which is essentially to de-sex them, and it screws them up forever. The young blemished girls go to school to learn how to serve the GEMs. And god forbid if a woman falls pregnant. If she does she is taken away and then killed. Because it's not that man's fault, is it? And the anger I feel on this is reflected in the pages of this book and OH MY GOD IT'S AWESOME. Sorry, that just slipped out.The message I took the most from this book is that your own choices are important. Imagine a world where you didn't have a choice? Because neither the Blemished or the GEMs have any control over their own lives.I've only read two of Sarah Dalton's books, but I'm hooked. She's fast becoming one of my favourite authors, and I will definitely read on in the Blemished series.",
                    "Het verhaal leest vanaf het eerste begin vlot en het tempo blijft hoog gedurende het hele verhaal. Mina is een nieuwe leerling op de Judasschool. Oorspronkelijk woonde ze met haar vader in regio 10 in Groot-Brittannië, maar vanwege omstandigheden is zij samen met hem overgeplaatst naar regio 14, een voor Onzuiveren harde regio, om daar een nieuwe start te maken.Onzuiver gaat over een samenleving waarin schoonheid en goede genen allesbepalend zijn. Genetisch gemanipuleerde mensen en kinderen zijn verheven boven de rest. Deze G.E.P.s bepalen de regels in deze samenleving. Onzuiveren hebben genen die volgens de regels waardeloos zijn en dus onbruikbaar. Onzuiveren hebben zelfs een eigen uniform om hen te onderscheiden van de rest: een zwart tuniek met een zwarte hoofddoek.Het gedrag van G.E.P-kinderen t.o.v. Onzuiveren is regelrecht onbeschoft. Onzuiveren worden beschouwd als minderwaardig. Onzuiveren die zich niet aan de regels houden, krijgen te maken met zeer zware straffen. Sommigen zelfs met de dood tot gevolg.Zelfs het onderwijs dat Onzuiveren volgen is compleet anders dan het onderwijs aan G.E.P.s. Zo krijgen de G.E.P.s les in alle vakken zoals wij die ook kennen van school. De lessen voor de Onzuiveren bestaan echter uit praktische lessen, zodat de Onzuiveren later in dienst te kunnen zijn van de elite, als bijvoorbeeld dienstmeisje of kok.Het is een intrigerende gedachte, een kind op maat gemaakt. Persoonlijk moet ik er niet aan denken dat ik mijn eigen zoon had kunnen laten ontwerpen en genetisch perfect had kunnen laten maken voor de op dat moment geldende schoonheidsidealen. Het is zó onnatuurlijk. De wetenschap is helaas al ver op het gebied van genetische manipulatie, op dit moment om ziektes te kunnen bestrijden, maar ooit zullen wetenschappers te maken krijgen met de vraag waar de grens ligt wat ethisch en moreel nog verantwoord is.Het boek bevat een beschrijving die mooi weergeeft hoe de kinderen die genetisch gemanipuleerd zijn er uitzien in de ogen van de Onzuiveren:Ondanks de verschillen in kleur hadden de G.E.P.s van hun kruin tot hun tenen iets dat overeenkwam. Ze waren allemaal zo perfect dat hun gezichten samensmolten tot een geheel.Er vindt op school een heftig incident plaats en tot haar grote verdriet staat Mina machteloos. Dit is het begin van een aantal gebeurtenissen die Mina doen beseffen dat zij, net als G.E.P.s het recht heeft op een echt leven. Haar houding zorgt ervoor dat ze in de problemen komt en al gauw heeft Mina geen andere keus dan te vluchten samen met haar vrienden. Deze vlucht is razend spannend beschreven en ik merkte dat ik regelmatig door de spanning mijn adem inhield bij het lezen ervan.Onzuiver is een spannend en fascinerend verhaal, vooral vanwege de thema's zoals klonen, racisme en het zich verzetten tegen de gevestigde orde. Ik heb genoten van dit originele verhaal en geef het graag 4 sterren.",
                    "Pfoe, dit was absoluut een YA zoals ik hem al een tijdje niet gelezen had!Onzuiver speelt zich af in een toekomstig Groot-Brittanië, waar de mensheid niet meer is wat het geweest is. Het is een gemengd leven geworden van Onzuiveren, en G.E.P.’s: de mensen die perfect gecreëerd zijn door middel van het gebruik van de juiste genen, en wat nogal voor wrijving tussen de mensen zorgt. Dat Onzuiveren moeten werken voor de G.E.P.’s en slecht worden behandeld, helpt daar niet aan mee, en maakt dat de kloof tussen de generaties alleen maar groter en groter wordt. Maar hoe kun je je eigen leven leven, als je niet eens achter je eigen standpunt mag staan, zowel als Onzuivere als een perfect gecreëerd persoon? Is de mensheid echt daadwerkelijk op het punt beland dat het streven naar perfectie het enige is dat nog telt, en slavernij weer terugkomt om de (perfecte) mensen nog meer tevreden te stellen?Het verhaal draait voornamelijk om de stoere Mina, een Onzuivere die dolgraag haar eigen leven zou willen leiden en om zou willen gaan met de mensen waarmee ze zelf om wilt gaan. Het stoort haar enorm dat ze niet eens een woord mag wisselen met iemand van ‘de andere groep’, al helemaal geen gevoelens mag koesteren voor zo’n perfect persoon, en zodra dit wel gebeurt, zij hier direct de schuld van krijgt, zij is tenslotte de Onzuivere, iemand die perfect is kan gewoon niets verkeerd doen en zij komen er daarom dus altijd mee weg, wat ze ook doen. Een Onzuivere niet. Het is mede dankzij deze gedachtengang en problemen die groeien op school, dat ze klaar is voor een echte stap in haar leven, zonder dat iemand haar daar van af zal kunnen houden: ze is er klaar mee om zo behandeld te worden, ze wil haar eigen leven leven, met de mensen die ze zelf uitkiest om dingen mee te kunnen delen. Zullen zij en haar vrienden die ze ontmoet op deze spannende, onstuimige zoektocht naar de vrijheid, het ultieme - en vooral vrije - eindpunt weten te bereiken?Onzuiver is een ontzettend vlot geschreven verhaal, dat een zeer strakke spanningsboog weet te houden van begin tot eind, mede dankzij het realistische dat erdoorheen verweven is en dat je aan het denken zet. Het zou tenslotte zomaar kunnen dat wij op den duur ook die kant op gaan… De personages zijn boeiend: je ziet ze als lezer groeien en begint steeds meer achter hun beweegredenen te komen, waardoor ze steeds echter zullen gaan voelen. Ze vechten voor wat ze waard zijn en verzetten zich hevig tegenover de mensen die hen koste wat kost willen veranderen in mensen die zij het liefste zien. Totaal niet zoals ze écht zijn, dus! Ook de snelle, onverwachte plottwists zorgen ervoor dat je steeds weer verder wilt lezen om erachter te komen wat er daadwerkelijk aan de hand is en wat er zal gaan gebeuren. Het eind kan ergens afgerond aanvoelen, maar toch heb ik het gevoel dat er nog veel meer aan zit te komen. Nu weet ik dat het een trilogie is, en ik hoop dan ook van harte dat de rest ook vertaald zal gaan worden… ik wil gewoon weten hoe het verdergaat met het groepje vrienden! Ik ben in ieder geval om, en raad dit begin van deze aanstaande trilogie dan ook van harte aan :)*er is voor de liefhebbers van Onzuiver ook al een novelle vertaald: ‘De Onzuiverserie 1,5 - De G.E.P. files: Elena’, dat gaat over… inderdaad, Elena, die ook een rol speelt in Onzuiver. Ik heb ervan genoten en het heeft mij nog meer inzicht gegeven over de wereld die zo ontzettend is veranderd. Zeker een aanrader, voor als je Onzuiver hebt gelezen! En DAT EINDE…*",
                    "(Source: Purchased from Smashwords.com.)15-year-old Mina is blemished. This means that she has a genetic predisposition for a disease, and in a world where only perfect babies are cloned, this makes her a lesser member of society.After cloning cured diseases such as diabetes and mental health problems, all babies are created and birthed in a lab, and are called GEMs, whilst those with imperfect genes are sterilised and not allowed to breed. Mina has just over a year until she will be sterilised, and will then go on to be a servant – cleaning and serving the GEMs.Mina has a secret though – she has telekinesis, and her father wants to train her to use it. Daniel, a boy at her school also has a gift – he has visions. Mina and Daniel together wonder if they could maybe make a difference in the world, but things are never that easy.What does the future hold for Mina and Daniel? What is ‘the resistance’ all about? And is there more to life than being sterilised and worked like a slave?This was an interesting dystopian, with a hint of romance.Mina was an okay character. She didn’t like being a blemished, but she wasn’t afraid to stand up for her beliefs either, and if she could have run away from it all, she would only do it if her friends and family who she loved were with her.There were quite a few nasty characters in this story, the worst being one of Mina’s school teachers. I really wanted Mina to pay her back for what she did to her, but I also didn’t want Mina to anger her further!The storyline in this book was okay, although I did wonder if a bit more explanation of certain aspects of the world building would have helped. Otherwise, the idea of the blemished was quite clever, and I liked how possible and realistic the story seemed.I wasn’t expecting a love triangle in this story, but there was one! In fact it was almost like two love triangles, because there was Daniel-Mina-Sebastian, and then there was Mina-Daniel-Angela. I can’t say that I was really romanced by either of the boys in this though, and I really didn’t have much of an opinion over which one Mina should pick, to be honest, I kinda felt like she didn’t really have strong feelings for either of them until the end.The pacing in this book was okay until the end, when it seemed to get really slow, which was a bit annoying. The ending was happy enough, and things were tied up pretty nicely. I don’t really feel the drive to read the next book though, so I think I’ll probably just leave this series here.Overall, and okay dystopian with a touch of romance.6.75 out of 10."

                    "Lucas's Convenient Bride - Susan Mallery - 4 starsI initially struggled with this book - the ugly and skinny heroine was the object of ridicule and her husband only married her as she would not tempt him physically. He never really had a realization moment of how hurtful he was. However, the story is sweet with the characters growing on each other and learning to make it work. It's a bit cliche as it turns out the heroine was beautiful all along but it was a nice read.Jackson's Mail-Order Bride - Maureen Child - 4.5 starsI liked this book in the series better. It had a stronger emotional pull - I was rooting for the heroine and devastated when it seemed it wouldn't work out. I also liked how the hero was written - he was stubborn but a caring person who wanted to live a simple life alone.Overall it was a nice read with some strong and competent heroines!",

Austin's relationship with Rebecca Chambers is great but his relationship with 7-year old David, who lives in his old foster home, is even better.",

She has gone to ask him to loan his home to a children's asylum--and then the weather knocks out the power so she must spend the night. They have sex. She gets pregnant. They marry, but despite his powerful lust/love for this woman he barely knows, he decides it would be best if they don't have sex.

She is clumsy and timid around Austin. She has a naive optimism. But as we get to know her, we see a powerful determination. Her feelings can be hurt, but it doesn't break her or change her.Austin is much harder to like but over the course of the book we learn that he has some powerful hurts in his past. He clings to them a little more stubbornly than I would have thought possible given Rebecca's encouragement, but if he didn't, the book would be half as long.Rebecca's orphans who are taking up temporary residence in Austin's huge house, are important in the story and there are touching moments involving at least one of them.Am I the only person who found Rebecca's motivation to lose her virginity to be strange?Mature themes: there are a couple explicit sex scenes.

He grew up outside any circles of caring. Not believing he could have friends or loving parents or be anything but a nuisance. She has always had a crush on him, but loved a young man who was injured and subsequently died. This is the story of how they came together to reach for love and support.Well written as all of Susan Mallery’s books are. A story that tugged at me with the pains of child abuse that isn’t physical but leaves children certain they aren’t worth being loved.

                    " I liked the book but also felt that it times it went a little bit too long with it came to Austin's Angst. Austin was described very well as a very, very tempting man. Also shown very well was how inept kindhearted Rebecca was around him. Also the fact that he was a loner, always looking from the outside into the normal lives of others. His mother had done an awesome (not in a good way) of making him afraid to feel deeply and let it show. It caused him to push people way before they could reject him. It didn't take long for Austin to realize that sweet, caring Rebecca also had a core of steel. That made me smile.  I also enjoyed the little boy David who was in the home for orphaned children. Nobody wanted him and that is something that Austin can identify with all too well. There will be a H.E.A. but it will be a fight to the end. With the happy ending is a very sweet Epilogue to wrap up a few loose ends. "

                    "Try thinking about entering an ice skating competition when you can't even balance on ice! Doesn't it sound dreadful to you?Sadly, Nikki has to skate for an animal shelter to let it stay open. Even worse, she finds out an unbelievable fact that affects Nikki and Brandon's relationship! Nikki is determined to stop the animal shelter from closing, and the only way to prevent the shelter from closing is to skate and raise money. This may sound like a very easy task to accomplish, but actually, it is extremely hard. Especially when you have your arch enemy planning to cause disastrous trouble! Nikki faces so many conflicts in this book and has so many ideas that can hide her terrible skating skills.I really recommend this book to you if you have enjoyed the former Dork Diaries books❤️",
                    "Nikki's school, Westchester Country Day, is studying ice skating in gym so that students can participate in the Holiday on Ice charity show. Nikki signs up with her friends Chloe and Zoey in hopes that they can beat the awful MacKenzie. The only problem? Nikki can't skate. This is an even bigger problem when she chooses Fuzzy Friends as her charity-- and her crush Brandon has a big stake in that, because it is run by his grandparents, and if the animal shelter has to close, he might have to move. Nikki has other problems, like her goofy parents and annoying sister, having to read Moby Dick in school and do a project on it, and of course, figuring out whether or not Brandon really likes her. When MacKenzie sabotages Nikki's act for the ice show, will she be able to survive? Apparently, because Tales from a Not-So-Smart Miss Know-It-All came out on October 2nd.Strengths: This is what 6th grade girls mean when they want to read about romance, and reluctant readers zip through these because the pictures delude them into thinking that there isn't as much text. Very popular.Weaknesses: Strained my credulity on several counts-- ice skating for gym? Moby Dick? I also wanted to slap Nikki just a tiny bit for being shallow. At least she's not as annoying as Wimpy Kid."

                    "BEFORE THE BOOK HAS BEEN OPENED/READ/PURCHASEDWait, wait, wait.So . . . I was at the store . . . just browsing through the books that they had . . . and I stumbled across a bunch of copies of this book . . . and my first reaction was:OH MY GOD, THERE'S ANOTHER ONE?!?!?!?!NO ONE TOLD ME THIS! Absolutely no one. When I finished the first book, no one said, Hey Theresa, there's a 4th book, you know.AND WHY NOT?! I should know about this! I mean . . . I am aHUGE, GIGANTIC, HYPERLY SQUEALING fan of Nikki Maxwell's adventures.So if there's a 5th book, someone better tell me!Then again, if I knew about the 4th book directly after I finished reading the third one, I would have waited for the 4th book in AGONY. So . . . the agony was avoided for now.BUT JEEZ, I seriously wish I knew about book number 4 sooner!So. My review for this lovely, lovely installment of Dork Diaries AWAITS! (Jeez, I can't wait to read it. I should have bought a copy, but alas . . . I have no money.)I need to read this book. This is definitely happening within the next month because if it doesn't . . .I'm afraid heads might roll . . .(As of July 29, 2012) AFTER THE BOOK HAS BEEN CHECKED-OUT FROM THE LIBRARY AND READLet me just say that Nikki Maxwell isONE. HUGE. DRAMA QUEEN.I know. I know. I'm such a hypocrite. Because . . . . I'm a drama queen TOO!!!!!! Y'know, except I say Oh my god! instead of OMG!. If you met me about 3 years ago, you would have met my OMG self.If:1. You get bugged by the use of OMG.2. You get bugged by dramatic pessimism.3. You get bugged by the voice of your average, overly dramatic teenage girl.THEN this book is not for you. Seriously.Because I know a bunch of people that get SO ANNOYED by the use of OMG and LOL and TTFN and whatever other acronyms there are that they would KILL SOMEBODY.And me being the very cautious and caring reviewer, I don't want anyone getting hurt because you got annoyed by the overflow of teenage girliness in this book.Anyway, I LOVE the teenage girliness in this book, mostly because, well, as cliche as it SEEMS and as many girls that walk this planet that go around shouting OMG! every fifteen seconds, there aren't many books like this.I mean she's a fourteen year old girl.I've read books about fifteen-eighteen year old girls who don't go OMG. They just narrate with descriptions and loooooong words and melodramaticness.Nikki doesn't. There's no purple prose here--SHE JUST GETS RIGHT TO THE POINT.And I LOVE IT.Example: A hot guy walks by the main character.Melodramatic, Typical Paranormal-Romance Lead Girl (ew.): He was so beautiful as he walked down the hallway, he seemed to glide like an angel. His muscles flexed gracefully as he walked towards the door. His skin glistened as he reached for the door knob, and he twisted it so slowly and angelically that I almost fainted. (Please note that this particular lead girl was describing a shirtless guy opening a door.)Nikki Maxwell: LIKE OMG! This totally hot, shirtless guy went to open the door and I almost FAINTED from how gorgeous he was!See how much time you save with Nikki Maxwell?And seriously. No teenage girl can be as melodramatic and descriptive as the paranormal-romance lead girls that I read about.Well, this is just another opportunity for me to bash on paranormal romances. (I . . . dislike them.)Anyway, the way Nikki words her words made me LAUGH. She made jokes along the way, and they were actually FUNNY!Not the cheesy kind where there's the drum set in the background that goes Bah-dump-pah! and there are crickets chirping.Oh, and yeah, the happy ending was pretty predictable. There's been one in every Nikki Maxwell book so far, but somehow, I sorta don't mind.This book was a FAST READ. Even though there are 344 pages (which would have taken me AGES to finish if this was a regular small print novel), I finished it within three days.Maybe it's the pictures that take up the room, or that the words also take up a lot of room so there aren't as many sentences on each page and stuff.Plus, the voice and the plot just had me STUCK on the book. I didn't want to stop reading!You see, my dear fellow review readers, I really like voice.EMOTION IN YOUR WRITING. That's what writing needs.I mean if the character only sat back and just . . . OBSERVED (like, only describing her surroundings and what things look like, but NOT giving out her thoughts and opinions), it's BORING to READ.One of my best friends was reading The Hunchback of Notre Dame and there were TWO WHOLE CHAPTERS just to describe a cathedral.Descriptive Chapter Number One: Notre DameDescriptive Chapter Number Two: Birds-Eye-View of Notre DameNO JOKE.Of course my best friend skipped them.And besides, don't all cathedrals look the same?And of course, your average paranormal romances (ew).The lead girl usually falls for a very hot guy, right? So she DESCRIBES the hot guy over and over and over and over and over. And yeah, she might give her opinions about how hot the guy is.BUT IT DOESN'T GET TO THE POINT!It's like, OH. MY. GOD, can you just MOVE ON WITH THE STORY! The guy is hot. YOUR POINT IS MADE!Even with all those descriptions, I still can't imagine a guy THAT HOT.Oh, and this story had your typical high school characters in them.NIKKI MAXWELL Your average teenage girl with that OMG habit, a family she can be embarrassed by, and no. She's not a super model.CHLOE AND ZOEY Lead girl's best friends. You can't go to high school without those, right?MACKENZIE The evil yet super-model girl, and enemy of the lead girl.BRANDON Yes, the one guy that the lead girl has a crush on.It all seems really cliche, but I haven't found a lot of books with this kind of character build.So the cliche idea isn't so cliche after all. VERY INTERESTING.Oh, and Nikki's reactions to things are also pretty cliche-yet-not-cliche. SHE FREAKED OUT ABOUT EVERYTHING.She worried about people's thoughts about herself, and the worst things that might happen.I mean I think she's the kind of girl where if a guy said, You look really pretty today, she'd say, WHAT?! SO I LOOKED UGLY YESTERDAY?!Anyway, overall, if you're not freaked out by your average teenage girliness and you want a good laugh from a book, this book is the one you should put on your to-read list!FOUR SPARKLY SPARKLY STARS.",
                    "Book Description:Nikki Maxwell isn't at all surprised to find out that her crush Brandon volunteers at a local animal shelter. He's such a sweet guy - of course he wants to help those adorable puppies! Then Brandon tells her that the shelter is in danger of closing, and Nikki knows she can't let that happen. Especially when she discovers a shocking secret about Brandon that makes keeping that shelter open more important than ever. So Nikki and her friends Chloe and Zoey enter an ice skating competition to help raise money for the shelter, but (big surprise) Mackenzie has to stick her nose in and cause trouble so that she can be the one to swoop in and save the day. No way will Nikki let that happen: She'll just have to come up with some extra creative ideas this time!My Review:This book is truly amazing! Nikki is doing a holiday on ice show and the charity is called fuzzy friends since its in danger of closing down. Brandon volunteers there, so that's why she is helping. Mackenzie is mad that nikki, chloe, and zoey got it first, so she goes out of her way to sabotage their act. When u read this book, u'll figure out some secrets about brandon......",
                    "While the Diary of a Wimpy Kid series is by far the most popular series in my school library, Dork Diaries is also very popular. I must confess that I find Dork Diaries more enjoyable. Maybe it's because I don't find Greg very likeable, maybe because I can relate to a girl main character better. But I think that it is most likely because Nikki personifies so well the dramas of middle school. I have to laugh at how horrified she becomes at things that I no longer would even blink at, but which really are so important to kids at that age. I also like Nikki and her friends because they are real with talents and weaknesses who often make poor decisions and then have to live with the consequences.In this particular book, Nikki and her best friends are putting together an ice skating routine to help save an animal rescue organization. But then Nikki tries ice skating and discovers that she has trouble just standing up. She decides to try to get out of the charity event and then finds out that her crush, Brandon, has a special connection to the shelter and she must do something to help. At the same time, Nikki's nemesis Mackenzie does everything she possibly can to make Nikki's life more difficult. With plenty of drama as well as humor, I couldn't help but cheer Nikki on as she struggles with her challenges both at home and at school. Girls especially will find much to enjoy in this series. The humorous illustrations add the perfect touch. I highly recommend this series to middle grade readers looking for something beyond Diary of a Wimpy Kid.",
                    "Up until this book, I'd thoroughly enjoyed this series and found it to be a fun, light, and easy read. As I continued to turn the pages, getting deeper into the story, I found myself being irritated by Nikki and her family. In one chapter, the mother left fourteen year old Nikki and her six year old sister home alone to bake who knows how many Christmas cookies to hand out to friends and family. Therefore, Nikki not only had to babysit her troublemaker sister but manage not to burn the house down as well (the cookies burned so bad, a window had to be opened to release the smoke). I just couldn't believe it. At another point, Nikki started reading a book (Moby Dick for middle schoolers? Really?) she had a project due on, the night before. Which, by the way, the author never returned to this, leaving it hanging as to whether or not the teacher approved of what Nikki came up with (a video of her sister in the bath pretending to be a whale). There were just a lot of unrealistic things (i.e., ice skating for gym class) and I felt the story was all over the place. There were way too many ideas and I found myself forgetting what the point of the entire thing was.The plot was a cute one and I'm disappointed it wasn't executed as well as it could have been... but here's to hoping the next one will be better."

It is to books what hallmark is to movies, a cliche and predictable feel-good story that isn’t trying to be anything else. And that’s what makes it great! We live in a hard enough world and it feels good to spend a few hours in a world where you know no matter happens it all works out, especially when it also encourages your faith in doing so! That said, it did feel a little rushed. I would’ve like spending more time with The couple. Good thing this is a series so I can see them a bit later! :)",

Any of his cousins could be guilty, but which one? Theyâ€™re all experts in the art of stealing time...,After surviving a lightning strike, Kiya Mortenson is determined to get just one thing in her life right. And if that means taking a job as nanny to five pugs on a campsite in the Oregon wilderness, then so be it. It doesnâ€™t hurt that the job comes with some spectacular male eye candy, including her new bossâ€™s gorgeous grandson. If only she didnâ€™t keep having this strange sense of deja vu...,When Peter discovers his own family is stealing time from Kiya, all bets are off. While she may drive him crazy at times, itâ€™s clear that itâ€™s not just lightning thatâ€™s creating some serious sparks between them.

                    "Kiya Mortenson has run into a string of bad luck. She was struck by lightning. Right after she checks out of the clinic with a fresh bill of health, her car decides to stop working on a very dangerous road. Luckily she is saved by a hunky looking man who takes her into town, and pays for her car to be towed. As it turns out, she’s going to need some cash to fix her car. Hunky guy who saved her mentioned his grandmother might hire a helping hand, so she heads off to their RVs. Meanwhile Peter Faa has also entered the town. With Peter’s (kind of) sidekick, a ghost in the shape of a glowing ball, they are determined to track down the killer of a recent string of deaths. Peter is a part of the Watch, a paranormal police order. He has with him DNA evidence that the killer is a member of his family.I’m not new to MacAlister’s work. I greatly enjoyed her Aisling Grey series. So when this one popped up I was very excited to get my hands on it. MacAlister’s novels, or what I’ve read of them, are fast paced romantic comedies with a paranormal twist. Time Thief introduces a new race of people called Travellers. Travellers, well they travel. They live a gypsy kind of life style, moving around from place to place. They can steal time, but have to pay for it or karma will literally bite them. Kiya ends up working for grandmother Faa, caring for her pugs. Because she isn’t a part of the family they set her up in a tent away from the RVs, and before long she runs into Peter Faa who is poking around in the woods. The first meeting between them doesn’t go well, but it isn’t long until Peter is hurt, and runs into Kiya’s tent. It doesn’t take long for Kiya to decide she is going to help him. Together they sort of put two-and-two together until they figure out who the murder is.There is a ton of silliness in these pages, but it might be too silly for my taste. I’m so glad when the heroine isn’t a cop, P.I., detective, or working for some unknown kind of investigative company. Kiya starts out as just a girl down on her luck. She comes off as a little too dense for my taste. On top of that, first impressions mean a lot, and Peter Faa is kind of a jerk. In fact most of the people in the Faa family are jerks. While these two characters make a good match for one another, it bothered me when they didn’t see clues that are right in front of them. Peter is supposed to be a part of the other world Watch, but he’s too involved with watching Kiya to notice when something is buggy is going down.Time Thief’s pacing was well done, but the silliness of it all was a little too much for my taste. The characters seemed a little too dense and random for my taste. Peter and Kiya decide they love each other awfully fast, so fast even Peter’s ghostly friend says something about it. The magic system was very neat and pretty different, and I enjoyed that Kiya wasn’t a stereotypical paranormal heroine.- Beth",
                    "Oh dear God, Katie, this book was kind of a mess! I understand what happened though, with her husband and everything... I'm so sad to give her books anything below a 4 star rating, but I just have to this time. There were several plot errors, like our heroine knowing stuff before she was told. (Like who the last murdered person was.) I spotted a few grammar mistakes/typos and this usually doesn't happen with Katie's books. Or the mistakes aren't that obvious at least.I feel obliged to tell everyone that I'm a big fan of Katie's work and that I absolutely love every single one of her books and series that I have read, but I'm kind of reluctant to continue reading this one. The characters's banter was humorous as always, if even a little unrealistic. I thought Kiya was often a bit too unrealistically portrayed, maybe her witty replies were even a little bit over the top to the point that I even felt a little annoyed when she opened her mouth. I felt like there was no chemistry at all between the two main characters and that's just really a pity. I couldn't get into their relationship, but I know that if I could have that Peter would easily have been one of my favourite heroes. Peter's everything you could wish for in a potential love interest. He's kind, caring, not to mention incredibly hot and he has the most beautiful eyes Kiya has ever seen. (He's also kind of the underdog and I love me some underdogs.) But the book just didn't live up to my expectations of Katie MacAlister, this was below average and not even the witty banter and humour in it could save the book. Katie could have added a lot more background to her characters (especially Kiya and Peter) to make their actions more believable. They fell in love instantly and are ready to get married only days after they met each other, which isn't at all how someone in their thirties acts. (That's what I meant earlier with the unrealistic nature of the story.) The world of the Travellers is rather interesting though, so maybe I will consider reading the next book after all. (I'm actually really curious what's going to happen with Gregory!) I don't know yet, I just feel like giving Katie a big hug, because you can just deduce from her manner of writing that she was rather unfocused and probably in a lot of pain when she wrote this book. ",
                    "My review can also be found on my blog Collections.3.5 starsTime Thief centered around a supernatural group known as Travellers. Travellers can steal time from others and can actually go back in time with however many seconds, minutes, or days they've taken. Stealing time comes at a price, though, and the victims must be given payment in the form of silver, otherwise the Traveller will suffer the consequences. Taking too much time can also lead to death for either victim or Traveller. Both reasons seem to have kept Travellers in check for centuries.The whole Traveller and time stealing thing was basically simple and easy to understand. Only once you got all the information. And in this book, it was spread throughout the story, which may be why I got a little lost at times. I remember when I was a third into the book there was a conversation between the main characters where one was explaining the time stuff to the other, and while that character was getting it, I was left feeling a bit confused. It didn't affect my enjoyment of the book entirely. But for some reason I still think there was something I missed. I can't quite put my finger on what it was though.Other than my slight confusion at times, the book was pretty fun! What made it that way were the main characters Kiya and Peter. Kiya was bubbly and quirky. She had a tendency to ramble and had a hard time keeping her mouth shut. She wasn't a mean-spirited person at all, but she was also not the type to back down from a fight. When other characters in the book managed to make her angry, I kind of just wanted to pat her head and say, There, there. Peter was more of a serious, uptight person. Meeting Kiya threw him off though, and he gained a sense of humor and seemed more talkative than how I assumed he would be under normal circumstances. I did find some of the romantic things he thought and said to Kiya (and vice versa) cheesy, but I realized it suited their relationship, especially considering their personalities.The other Travellers focused on in this book were the Faa family. They were being investigated by Peter (he's part of the Watch, basically the supernatural police) for murders that have occurred in the area. I think the Faas were always suppose to come off as distant and suspicious and irritating. I can't say I ever liked them, expect one of them who I won't name for possible spoilers. I didn't even like the grandmother. I felt she just stayed in the background while the men in her family did whatever they wanted, and she was too cold and concerned with blood purity. Sad thing was Peter is her grandson. He didn't grow up with them, so it was easy for all of them not to care, but I still felt bad for him. I almost wished things had gone a slightly different route by the end.Time Thief might not have ended well for everyone, however, it was the ending that Kiya and Peter deserved. Overall, the entire book kept me entertained and laughing here and there. It was easy to get sucked into the story. There's a book two planned that will be focusing on a character introduced in this book, and I can't help but to wonder what will happen next.",
                    "Time Thief, Traveller #1, by Katie MacAlisterGrade:D“Unhand me, you deranged, if lovely, female!”Kiya Mortenson is not having a good day after being struck by lightning, for the second time, having her car breakdown in the middle of Oregon and losing the job she was covering for a friend. After meeting a friendly stranger, Kiya sets out to try to find work taking care of five rowdy pugs for an elderly Traveller woman. The Travellers are not very happy to have Kiya around but she needs the job to fix her car and get back to her life. The more time Kiya spends with the Travellers the more she learns about the supernatural world and her own past.Peter Faa is a Traveller who was never accepted by his family and has spent his life as an outsider. Peter has devoted his life to being a member of The Watch, the supernatural cops, who are now investigating the Faa family for murder. Peter never expected to find an outsider living with his family and Kiya soon snags all of his attention. Peter knows someone in his family has committed murder but it will take Kiya’s help to discover the actual killer.I am so disappointed in this book for so many reasons. I liked the beginning which is told by Kiya in first person but then the book switches to Peter’s point of view in second person. What???I’ve never come across a book told like this and found it very distracting, confusing and annoying. This continues through the rest of the book and almost made me DNF the whole thing.Kiya is one of the most annoying characters that I have ever read. She is flighty, ditzy and comes off as an idiot. She spends most of her time talking about her ego, id and superego or saying very inappropriate things that are supposed to come off as witty. I like my heroines to be strong, smart and sassy and Kiya was none of those things and just comes off as very immature thirty-two year old. Peter for some reason finds her adorable but spends his entire time yelling at her about bewitching him or how she is not smart. The two of them together drove me crazy.As the book goes on and on it becomes even worse and again I have no idea why I kept reading. About halfway through we get one of the most awkward and unsexy sex scenes I’ve ever read. After this Kiya and Peter like to make uncomfortably gross jokes about his ‘beefy cock’.For example: “Suddenly, he was there, beefy-filled condom and all, thrusting inside me in a manner that left me as the incoherent one.” I never want to read about a beefy-filled condom especially in a romance novel. Besides the bad sex these two are trying to solve a murder that is already solved but takes forever to wrap up.Time Thief was a big fail in my opinion and I will not being reading anymore of this series. ",
                    "How to review this book??? I will just have to be as honest as possible without giving away anything. Sorry guys but I just don't DO spoilers...We have a brand new novel from one of the most humorous writers today! Kiya is a unique woman. She starts out the book, with a broken down heap of a car sitting in a doctors office while waiting for her appointment because she has been struck by lightening AGAIN! Yep lightning DOES strike the same spot twice!This book is a laugh a minute! I read this book long into the night, and woke my husband from a sound sleep when my laughing got out of control. Talk about a mess a minute! Peter and Kiya are just too much fun!I have been a fan of Katie MacAlister's books for a while now, and this one is right up there with her other books. We still have the same type creatures as we find in all her other books. And the Watch are alive and well in this book.I HIGHLY recommend this book to anyone who wishes a good laugh and who loves a bit of romance thrown in. And mystery, boy do we have a mystery! And as usual Katie MacAlister uses her humor and all sorts of twists and turns to keep us off our feet for the entire novel.When I turned to the last page in my Kindle I was nearly crying because I wanted MORE!!!! Luckily I know her novella is due out in August with the next book in the series due out shortly thereafter! Thank God for that!Well what are you waiting for? Go grab your own copy!!!!"

                    "Another fantastic volume where Vaughan finally begins to reveal Hundred's origin of power, Hundred himself temporary loses his powers, and we learn just how he landed that fucking plane! Dramatic, violent, and intense. ",
                    "Vol. 6 of 10This volume includes an interesting introduction at the end of the book by Vaughan explaining the process of what goes into making a graphic novel. I was a little surprised to find out that most people find graphic novels disjointed because of all the hands that go into the pot in order to expedite issues for monthly production. If anything, all the series/graphic novels I have read seem to NEED that collaboration between writer and artist to translate their vision onto paper and I feel have been successful at it. It’s a marriage of the two. I also enjoyed seeing how they have people play out the character scenes and pose as the panel is to going to be drawn. I hadn’t ever really thought about how these scenes get on paper, but I thought it was a neat process. Recap of this volume to remind myself. ****Possible spoilers ahead****:--We see a second possible archnemesis? This one steps out of the river swathed in an electric field, causing a blackout throughout the whole city. He is looking for Mitch to pass on information on how they got their powers, so it is unknown whether he’s a good or bad guy. His powers however are able to neutralize Mitch’s powers, so it is yet to be seen what will come of this story.--The issue of immigration is mentioned but never concluded. Can I just say that I’m a little tired of everytime immigration is brought up it is immediately blamed on Mexicans. They are not the only people who are immigrants. People from all over Europe, Asia, Africa, South America, to name a few, immigrate to the U.S. It is not just Mexico. That joke gets a little old and I found it insulting how Mexico is the first place people point a finger to.--We see a bit more of a glimpse into what happened on 9/11. I did question though how Mitch knew the second tower would get hit. He was already using his powers to call on some fighter jets to assist him in stopping the second plane from hitting the second tower, but these are just glimpses we see into the past without much explanation. This is already the sixth volume so I’m wondering when Vaughan is going to start tying up ends.Overall, a good issue.",
                    "Something wicked comes in this way..",
                    "Grown man topics is something you gotta deal with, No matter how many super powers you love it ain’t gonna equal up to this real shit....Let me just start by saying this is the best “Graphic Novel” I have ever read. I wouldn’t even call this a comic. I know that there is a difference between a comic and a graphic novel but I’ve also seen the terms use interchangeably but this piece of work is too great to be called anything else. I read “Y The Last Man” so I was a fan of Brian K Vaughn (Although Under The Dome is terrible). Ex Machina exceeded my expectations. I love reading about super powers and the fight between good and evil and all that good shit but I also love seeing real issues discussed. Ex Machina does this perfectly. The parallel NYC was amazing and Mitchell Hundred is one of the most interesting characters I’ve seen.Vol 6 moved a little slower. It had the story of a power outage but this volume also helped to build up the backstory. I don’t want to give anything away so I’ll just say that I highly recommend Ex MachinaFYI: I’ll leave a review for all ten volumes but only change the last paragraph because the first three paragraphs were so powerful that they are relevant to all ten volumes.. LOL",
                    "Another great volume in the Ex Machina series. Finally, Mitchell's mom shows up again! We learn a little bit more about Mitchell's bodyguard, Bradbury. And a mysterious guy appears (from the future? from the past? from an alternate dimension??), which mysteriously causes a complete north east power outage. What is the connection between Mystery Guy and Mitchell's powers? It is hinted at, but we don't learn much, and it's never 100% clear if Mystery Guy can be trusted.",
                    "Pretty intriguing, but this new volume still doesn't stand up to some of the earlier ones. With the introduction of a new character from a alternate timeline, things are starting to get MUCH more interesting. However, there are still more questions than answers and I'm hoping these get answered shortly.",
                    "Ex Machina: Power Down takes Mayor Hundred and throws him into the Great Northeast Blackout of 2003 (which I weirdly lived through but have no memory of), doing its usual mix of city politics and superhero antics, both fairly well.I admit, the part I always like most about these comics is The West Wing-style discussion of city emergency policy that take up the opening pages (hence instantly falling for Nolita Cemac, OEM Liaison). It doesn’t get as much play as some of the policy-oriented issues, but I still appreciate it.The ‘superhero’ side of Power Down deals with Hundred losing his abilities to communicate with machines during the blackout, and dealing with a traveler from an alternate version of Earth, where the Cold War still rages and 9/11 never happened. (Incidentally, the discussion Hundred has about how best to memorialize 9/11 is probably the best rumination in the book). Once again, we get a tantalizing glimpse of the nature of Hundred’s powers, only for it to be snatched away too soon.Of particular note is the backmatter to the comic, which contains a ton of interesting behind-the-scene stuff, including information on Vaughan’s collaborative process and the artistic workflow. Definitely worth a read.",
                    "More super heroes mixed with politics. During a city-wide blackout, Hundred faces a dimension traveler who has a warning about Hundred's new powers. I find the volumes that explore Hundred's powers, and where they came from, to be more interesting."
